LACPEC Conference with Roberto Aguilera and Roberto F. Aguilera,"Hello everybody and greetings from Moscow. I'm Tatyana Mitrova. It's really my great pleasure to welcome our distinguished guest today. Pavan Sukhdev, president WWF and CEO of the GIST advisory, who is going to prove to us that nature has actually issue invoices and we can calculate them for her. Antoine Huff, co-founder of Kairos and senior scholar Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy, who is going to show us what a powerful role advanced technology can play in serving the oil and gas industry's ability to manage its own methane emissions. Poppy Kalezi, Global Energy Director of the Environmental Defense Fund on the eve of the EU Green Deal is going to talk to us about how important transparency and auditing are to establish the right conditions for business to integrate particular sustainability factors. And Vanessa Miller-Pells, director of Energy Innovation and Impact at Microsoft, will give us a sense of how digitalization and artificial intelligence can benefit men's understanding of the nature. We all definitely agree that our industry should become sustainable. There is a big role for the governments to play, for example, with carbon pricing, but the responsibility of the industry itself is also huge. Our live panel today will address sustainability in the oil and gas industry using the lens of measuring what matters. Oil and gas industry is being held to account on its sustainability performance for quite some time, but the problem is that our current sustainability measurement efforts are largely carried out to satisfy external stakeholders and even then, very imperfectly to the detriment of the public policymakers, investors and the industry itself. Slum flagship initiatives have emerged, but all would acknowledge that there is still a long way to go before businesses themselves are proactively developing and maturing the metrics that they need in order to improve their sustainability performance. You probably remember management guru Peter Drucker is often quoted as saying that you can't manage what you can't measure. Drucker meant that you can't know whether or not you are successful unless success is defined and tracked. It is 100% applicable to the oil and gas industry. We have an enormous amount of data. We love data and we know how to work with it, but what we do not know is which exactly metrics should we track to measure sustainability of our performance and how we are complying with the SDGs. We need some universal metrics which provide objectivity, which can be comparable and most importantly, which are fit for decision. This panel today will look at how to measure and improve sustainability performance, its contribution to the sustainability development goals and in particular, how to engage the internal stakeholders, the business decision makers in business administration, in operations, R&D and commercial roles so that they and their business can better enable development that is truly sustainable. Our four panelists are working at the cutting edge and will show us some of the way there. So without spending too much time on the introduction, let's move to our first speaker, Pavan Sukhdev, president at WWF and CEO at GISC advisory. So Pavan, what's wrong with the current ESG rating methodologies and how could they be improved? Thank you, Tatiana, for your thoughtful introduction and I'll have to ask you to be imaginative as I describe charts and X and Y axes, but that's fine. We are all engineers. I'm an ex-physicist myself. Astrophysics was my line before I went into banking and finance and I guess physicists by training, a banker by profession and an environmental economist by passion. And my work has been to demonstrate that the economics of nature matter. Just because something has a value but no price, it doesn't mean you can ignore it either as a policymaker or as an administrator or as a businessman. Oh wow, we seem to have slides. I can see something called measuring what matters for corporate sustainability. So GISC is my company, the one which I founded, as a means of responding in a commercial manner to the challenge of sustainability metrics. To me, as Peter Drucker says, you cannot manage what you do not measure. We are not measuring sustainability, right? Today there's so much talk about corporate sustainability and yet when you ask someone point blank, define corporate sustainability, I can tell you that it's really difficult to get an answer. So please ask me that question and I have an answer. To me, corporate sustainability is about measuring impacts in four dimensions. What are the four dimensions? They are the four capital dimensions. That is produced capital, financial capital, which is two sides of the same coin. You can buy manufactured goods and services. Don't go there yet. I just want to define sustainability before we move. Corporate sustainability is you need to be positive plus on the access of financial capital. You need to be positive on the access of human capital, which is your employees' knowledge, skills and health. So unless you can garner that, your employees are like a capital resource. In a sense, you have rented the employee, paying them a lease rental called salary and paying them maintenance called performance bonuses and so on. So you need to be positive on the access of maintenance called performance bonuses and so on. If they don't do well, you don't do well. If you want to do well in the marketplace, you begin with the workplace. So that is human capital. It's not yours. It's your employees' human capital. The third capital is natural capital and whether it is dead natural capital like oil and gas reserves or whether it is living natural capital, the ecosystem services that maintain us, all provide us food, fuel, fiber and everything that we know as life, we have to maintain them. If we run out of them, then we have a problem and that's a public good. Then there's social capital, which is the relationships, both the official and the unofficial. Official as in constitution, law and order, police, judicial system, taxation system and so on. Unofficial as in trust, respect, ability to live in communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims, for example. These are aspects of social capital. If you don't have social capital maintained in an economy, none of the other capitals can deliver the incomes which give them value. In economics, in finance, there's something called the capital asset pricing model. You can use that to price produced capital, human capital, natural capital, but you can't use that to value social capital because that's not a generator of income. But without social capital, it's the binding force. As an ex-physicist, I tell other physicists that think about it in terms of quarks and gluons. You need the quarks, the three quarks, and then this is the gluon basically. You think of it as particles. Then I tell them that think of the four capitals as aspects that have to be plus, plus, plus, and plus. You can't really net off human capital and natural capital thing. Oh, well, I do so much good training and development of my people, so it's okay. I can do a bit of negative natural capital impacts. Not really. I mean, you may, but the point is unless there's somebody else who's got the opposite situation, you will have a problem. If there's a thousand of you, a hundred thousand of you, it may be fine. The earth's a very big place. But if there's a million of companies which have got minus, minus, minus, plus, or indeed minus, minus, plus, plus, the things on which you are minus, the two axes of natural capital and social capital, which is typically where companies do have negative impacts, we will end up having such a massive overweight on negative impacts that you will have a global systemic problem. And there are two of them which we are facing right now. One is called inequity and poverty, and there's a lot of that. And the other one is called climate change. And there's a lot of that as well. So we have ignored performance metrics because why? Not because we don't know about the fact that you have to measure performance in four dimensions and not just one dimension, but because there is no accounting for externalities. There is a shareholder profit and loss. IFRS requires you to report it. It's reported every year or every quarter if you're an American company. But there is no IFRS for reporting on human capital, natural capital, social capital. And that's the problem. These are the areas of externalities. The value of externalities is massive, right? We are talking about the private sector, which is in any case, two thirds of the economy and jobs. So it is two thirds of impacts as well in terms of environmental impacts. We are not at present measuring the impacts of the private sector, and therefore we have uncharted, unrecorded externalities. And therefore, we are not managing what needs to be measured. What needs to be measured needs to be managed. We are not measuring externalities, and therefore we are not managing them. And we are doing the exact opposite of the topic of this seminar, which is measuring what matters. Externalities, my friend, matters. In fact, the reason why we don't measure them goes back in history, and this is really hilarious. So today, governments use something called the general equilibrium model to measure their economies. And the whole idea is that demand interacts with supply, and that prices are set by demand and supply, and that the composition of prices will be such that it gradually moves in the direction where people are optimizing their individual utilities. And that's basically a model that was created by someone called Leon Walras at the turn of the last century in 1905. Ironically, the reason he turned economics, which was really a social science, into maths is because he was constantly seeking his father's attention. He was a younger brother. His elder brother was a physicist. So you can say that today's mathematical focus on economics has been born out of what I describe as physics envy by a mathematician called Leon Walras, who, by the way, applied for the Ecole Polytechnique, and he couldn't get in, and he went to the School of Mines, and he didn't do that well as an engineer. But he created this mathematical model of the economy, which, because of its simplicity and its necessary simplicity, ignores externalities. And that's the genesis of our problem. We don't manage what we need to measure. Externalities, as a result of that, have become huge. We are talking about 11, 12, 14 trillion dollars of externalities in an economy which is 90 trillion dollars. These are not small. May I jump in? So you are talking about accounting externalities, and for sure we are not doing it properly in the oil and gas sector, but in the other sectors. I mean, you have huge experience. You are dealing with many sectors of the economy. Is anybody doing that? No. So are there any? This is a systemic and global problem, right? So the net result is whatever you are doing on ESG is essentially qualitative. It's basically judgmental. You are using environmental and social factors, and you are rating them one, two, three, four, five. You are adding them up. You are adding up things which don't compare. Environmental and social factors are drivers, are impacts. Governance is a driver. You can't compare one with the other. Governance drives all of the other factors. So today's state of affairs is terrible, and time has come for us to start measuring impacts. And the beauty is that with science and with economics together, it can be done. When we, whether it's my company, when we measure, if you could go to the next slide, which is basically showing you that the next slide shows you that lack of correlation that is happening, which is, by the way, any of the 600, if you compare, you will get the same level of lack of correlation. So this is not, I'm not criticizing MSCI or financial times. They are all like that. Why? Because they are not measuring the impacts. We need to start measuring the impacts. You can't just keep adding up qualitative ratings and making them appear quantitative and then end up with a lack of understanding of corporate sustainability, which is about being plus, plus, plus, plus. It's about being positive on human, natural, social, and obviously produced capital. Otherwise you don't survive as a company. On my next slide, I illustrate how we can actually do it, which is to measure capital impacts. Capital is an economic metaphor for value, and you can actually measure this and value it. You can measure environmental impacts, natural capital externalities. You can measure human capital externalities, social capital externalities, and even financial value addition, which is the missing bits, financial impacts beyond profits. They are there in the balance sheet and profit and loss of the company, but we don't report them simply because nobody asked us to report them. Companies are not required to report impacts on society. They are only required to report impacts on shareholders. In my next slide, I give you the example of how it can be done. And this is a simple case, simple as in everyone understands air pollution, right? Factories generate pollution. This is a cement factory, cement company, by the way, 15 factories somewhere in Asia. I can't give the name because it's confidential. It's a plant. So the way that we do it is to measure the dispersion of pollution coming from the chimneys. So essentially the pollutants that are the most important ones are SOx, NOx, and PM2.5 and PM10 particles. And the diagram on the top right-hand side shows where the pollution lands. How do we do this? Because we use the NASA global database of wind speeds and wind direction. We basically do our dispersion modeling. Yes, indeed, for all the physicists, we draw the Gaussian curves and plan it out literally location by location, pollutant by pollutant. That's how it is done. This is how the correct way of measuring impacts of air pollution are. So you know where the pollution lands. That's the diagram on the top right-hand side. But the point is you need to know how many people are breathing that pollution. For that, you need a global population map, which is one square kilometer by one square kilometer. And then once you've calculated the impacts, in other words, the absorption by the receptors, the people, then you have to go to the WHO database, which tells you what is the likelihood of an increase in respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases as a result of those increases in SOx, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10. Disease by disease, there is a WHO database that does this. And then you go to the country level and you work out for that country concerned, what is the morbidity and the mortality cost, which means in economic terms, how much does it cost to cure these diseases if the statistical probability of them striking you happens? And how much is the loss of life cost in terms of the family will lose X number of years of productive life of the mother or the father or the sister or the brother? What is the cost to that family of not having the breadwinner bring in that income? So we calculate these things and it's very sad to have to calculate statistical, sorry, to calculate the cost of losing lives, but there is a statistical probability of air pollution leading to human deaths. In fact, it's one of the biggest drivers of death around the planet, apart from smoking and so on. So this is how calculations are done. These are ways of estimating the capital costs, in other words, the human capital costs of an environmental impact. And in the same way, we can calculate using massive water scarcity data which we've contained, which we pull together. We can calculate the costs of water usage and then water pollution and so on and so forth. And human capital, the positive side, the value of training and development of the employee and what it means in terms of the present value of the future incomes that are increased as a result of this year's company training and development of its employees. That's positive. Bhavan, I have a question from the audience. What do you think if this evaluation methodology would be applied to the countries like Malaysia, Indonesia or India? How that would change our understanding of the whole picture? So I've got news for you. It is already being applied. The same logic that I have, the four capitals that I talked to you about, human, social, natural and produced capital. The United Nations has a report which has been published three times, 2012, 2014 and 2018. It's called the Inclusive Wealth Report. It's already available, but the problem is this, the policymakers are not listening because all they are looking at is GDP, GDP, GDP. They're looking only at GDP growth. So unfortunately, the problem that I'm describing to you, which has got to be driven from the corporate sector, from the private sector, the same problem exists at the macro level as well. Macro performance is being mismeasured as well, not just micro level or private sector performance. There is an inclusive wealth account for Malaysia. It's there in the report of 2018.

From our home office to yours, hope to see you there. Now let's move inside the industry and I'm happy to give the floor to my colleague Antoine Hough, senior scholar at Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy and also chief analyst and founding partner of Kyros, a technology-focused earth observation analytics firm. Antoine, the floor is yours. Thank you very much. Tatiana, thank you, Johanna, for the invitation to speak. I'm really excited and also humbled to share the stage with such great speakers and people who make such a big impact on the issues that we care about. The purpose of what we do at Kyros is very much in line with the objective of the career. So I've been spending most of my professional life doing oil market analysis, energy market analysis, and one of the key challenges that the industry has faced has always been the lack of reliable, timely, comprehensive data. This is particularly true when it comes to the climate footprint of the industry. For a very long time, we've been relying on self-reporting by companies and oftentimes self-reporting based on untested assumptions from engineers about the climate intensity of various processes. We're now moving to a very different world where technology is mature, is available to measure the climate impact of the oil and gas industry in very concrete, precise, reliable, and timely ways. This is, I think, a complete game changer. Maybe we can move on to, I think I have a few slides and I think some of them may be. If we move to the next one, our company Kyros has developed algorithms that extract information from existing satellites, specifically from Sentinel-5P from the European Space Agency, that provide very specific reliable measurements on major emissions around the world. So this is good news and bad news. Let me start with the bad news. The bad news is that based on our measurements, there's a lot more methane emissions in the world than we suspected. There's a lot more fugitive methane emissions out there, major events, than were accounted for using engineered estimates based on assumptions about the carbon intensity of the energy industry. We've run measurements on a daily basis for the last couple of years and looking at just last year, on average we detected about 100 major emissions a day around the world. This is a rough map of where these measurements have been detected, where the detections have been made. They cover the entire map. They cover the oil and gas industry as well as other industries like the coal industry. This is mostly as far as the oil and gas industry, upstream, a bit midstream, and of these 100 events a day, about 50%, about half, can be attributed to regions that are oil and gas producers and to the oil and gas industry. So the detections that we've measured are all above 10 hours of methane an hour and that translates roughly into 20 megatons of methane a year or 1.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, of which about half can be traced to the oil and gas industry. The map is still a work in progress. The technology is mature. The application of the technology and the translation of the technology into detailed measurements case by case is still a work in progress. There's still areas of the map that we don't cover as comprehensively as the others and there's some areas where there are some false positives that we are stripping out. We're eliminating filtering out from our assessment, but the assessments, generally speaking, is quite remarkable. It's bad news because it means the footprint of the industry is much larger than anybody suspected. It's good news because this opens the door for fixing the problem, for remediation and for improvements. And it's doing it in three ways. It's really allowing industry to improve its operations and reduce its footprint. It's enabling policymakers to design policies that really move the needle, that have an impact. And it's enabling the allocation of investment to where it matters, to where it has an impact on the carbon footprint. It's enabling investors to reconcile the goal for energy and the goal for climate stewardship. So let me take a couple of examples on the next slide. Here we have a look. If we can see the next slide, I'm not sure. We tracked detection in Algeria in the Saharan desert in January of this year. We detected three major emissions in early January at three different locations in Algeria. And here we have a picture of one of these detections that we've measured using a dispersion model to about 80 tons per hour. And we've also designed the algorithms and the technology to trace this event through its source. On the next slide, we've identified where the source is and we've identified in that area the number of wells and facilities that could potentially have been leaking. The next stage in our determination process has been to try to select among these wells, among these potential sources of the leak, the one specific area that was most likely responsible for the event. And the next slide, we've done so by combining different technologies, combining readings from Sentinel-5P to readings from other satellites, shortwave, infrared readings from Sentinel-2. And we've basically identified in this case a well that emitted methane, that vented methane for about eight days in January from January 1, 1st to January 8th, and then stopped emitting methane, stopped venting, but went into flaring. And here just when the detection of the vented methane stopped on Sentinel-5P, we started to pick up signs of methane flaring from the same location, from one particular location that we then identified as being the one source. So this is a significant event. This was about 80 tons of methane an hour, so a major source of emission equivalent to several large coal-fired power plants. There's many other cases that we've looked into. On the next slide, I have a very brief summary of some of them, including an event in the Permian Basin in December of last year that we've traced to a particular source using a different mix of technologies. We've identified events in Turkmenistan, no surprise there, I guess, in the Shatlik gas field. In Russia, we've picked up major emissions in September 2019 from areas along the Yamal pipeline, and we've identified particularly a natural gas compressor station that was responsible for large emissions of about 20 tons per hour. In Australia, we've picked up emissions from a coal mine. So I'm happy to go into more detail into the various technologies and the various methodologies that we've applied to these particular cases, but the key message I want to focus on, and I want to keep my remarks very brief, is really that the technologies today are game-changers, and this is a work in progress. We're not the only ones developing new technologies. Others in the field are developing new instruments, launching new satellites that will advance, I think, our visibility on the industry tremendously, but already today, using existing technology, existing satellites, we can really help the industry improve its operations. We can help policymakers design the right policies. We can help the investment community develop more robust ESG methodologies, and very much like what Pavan was saying, we can really improve the E component of the ESG standards and come up with very, very reliable, very robust measurements of methane. So I think this is really important, and the three particularly key characteristics of these technologies are threefold. Independence. It's very important for industry to not simply report its own emissions, but rely on independent third-party measurements. Nobody can trust any particular oil and gas company in what they disclose about the measurements. It's very good to measure, and a lot of companies have announced calls to disclose their methane footprint, their carbon footprint, and to come clean and leave the kimono on their operations. But nobody will trust necessarily what company X, Y, or Z is saying about their own measurements because of lessons learned from the Volkswagen scandal, for example, diesel gate or other incidents. It's very important to be comprehensive, and the satellite detection is particularly useful because it's global. It's not just detected to areas that are already suspected of being a source of emissions. It spans the entire world and looks for emissions when we don't, where we don't necessarily expect them. We've picked up, for example, large emissions in Bangladesh. Not a big producer of oil and gas, not a big consumer of oil and gas, but the large source of emissions from leaking pipelines that are really either out of shape, out of maintenance, or that have been used for pilfering by the population. And finally, it's real time. So it really enables quick action, quick remediation. Whenever an incident is detected, it opens the door for quick, corrective measures and mitigation. So the technology today is here, is mature, is constantly improving, but is already enabling the industry to reconcile the goal of responsible climate stewardship and energy development and producing the energy that we need to sustain economic growth and to provide energy access to those that still need energy.

Let's move to Vanessa Miller-Fells, who is part of Microsoft's Sela Environmental Sustainability Team and serves as Director of Energy Innovation and Impact. Vanessa, please. Hi, everybody. Thank you Tatiana for having me. First, it's an honor to be on this panel and I'm really humbled to join you and also my esteemed fellow panelists. We've had a fantastic introduction by Pavane and also amazing work done by Antoine and Keros. This is certainly something we're also very interested in as Antoine kind of teed it up. There's a lot of data that's being analyzed and so we see it as an exciting opportunity for a technology company like Microsoft. I'm particularly excited to join this talk, Gaia Talk, because it's a great name. One of my favorite books about climate change is called Facing Gaia by French philosopher Bruno Latour. It's a particular honor. In January, Microsoft launched a carbon initiative setting new goals for our company to become carbon negative by 2030. I think I'll touch upon kind of some of the issues we faced and we are facing as we want to kind of first assess the challenge and then address the challenge. So to guide our sustainability journey, we've developed kind of a few principles and I focus on three of the main principles. First principle, and it will echo very much what you've talked about, is put the data and the digital technology to work and simply stated what we can't solve a problem that we don't fully understand. Second principle is tech responsibility for our carbon footprint. And the third principle is empower others, partners and customers and policymakers around the world to assess and address their own carbon footprint. And we hope to kind of take some of the lessons we are learning from our own kind of exercise in addressing and abating our carbon footprint. You can go to the next slide. So I think there was a good question that was raised earlier with Antoine is how can we use some of the technology like the one Kero's developed for methane tracking to assess the biodiversity and the situation for the fauna and flora of the world. And this resonates very well with something we've an effort we've just kind of undertaken and announced on Earth Day this year, so about a month ago, what we call the planetary computer. This effort of building a planetary computer is really to try to address this question of how do we get better at understanding the problem? This is a computing endeavor, not surprising for Microsoft, but the goal is really to aggregate global environmental data that's collected from a number of sources and to employ machine learning and other techniques, other kind of artificial intelligence techniques to better understand the challenges faced in the planetary health. We hope that this planetary computer will provide answers not only to Microsoft, but also to our customers, but even more broadly to the scientific community that's about to plan sustainability and how we address sustainability. So what is this planetary computer capable of doing? What would be a good example? Well, I think what Kero's does could certainly maybe fit in that, but we've been focused, for example, on how machine learning, satellite imagery, user source data around the world and in real time can help us assess, for example, on the ground forest covers and how that can be used for industrial construction, site surveys, or for forest preservation efforts. So we're really like, I think this measuring matters is very much at the core of this planetary computer. Assessing the planet's earth must become a more sustained, integrated practice that allows us to understand exactly what is happening in real time to enable smart decision making. For us, it really is captured in this kind of simple sentence, but it should be as easy for anyone in the world to search the state of the planet as it is to search the internet. And this planetary computer is kind of an ongoing development, and I'll kind of talk also a little bit to its genesis, but I think it really resonates very well with some of the policymaker's effort we've seen, particularly in Europe, but hopefully globally. The EU announced, I think earlier this year, a Mission Hearth initiative, and this Mission Hearth initiative is to improve disaster response and preparedness, and I think the goal is to bring also together the best scientific and industrial expertise to improve the earth modeling, kind of building almost a digital model of planet earth, kind of a digital tween. So we hope that we can really partner on building this planetary computer. What's kind of the genesis of the planetary computer? And we can go to the next slide. It's an evolution of a Microsoft program that was called AI for Earth that we launched in 2017. The Microsoft AI for Earth was putting AI technology and machine learning technology into the hands of leading ecologists, conservation technologists, and organizations around the world that are working to protect our planet. We focused on these four pillars that are indicated here, ag"

So, let's start off. So, stimulation and completion design improvements have allowed the oil and gas industry to unlock this value and they've been instrumental in a shale revolution. You know, we've made progress in areas ranging from moving forward down to wells to the number of clusters, clusters facing etc. Where do you see the industry's present day focus regarding stimulation and completion design improvements to further unlock value and do you think the focus will change in the next five years? Mike, would you like to share your thoughts? Yeah, sure. I think one of the big things I see these days is improving the cluster efficiency, you know, along the horizontal well. So, a lot of operators are working on optimizing perforation strategies. So, a lot of exploration going on. How do we perforate to best ensure that we distribute we distribute both the fluid volume and the prop and mass as uniform as possibly into our perf clusters? So, experimentation is definitely going on with, you know, how many holes, how big the hole size, do I shoot the hole up, down, or even maybe 90 degree, 270 degree. So, I think there's a lot of research going on there to improve that cluster efficiency and make the stimulation as uniform as possible. And then I think one of the big things too is as we're going now longer and longer on our horizontal wells, you know, I've seen experimentation with four mile laterals ensuring that we get, you know, an effective stimulation across these very long laterals. It can be crucial here in the next several years because I think that's going to be here to stay the, you know, the longer horizontal wells. And then I think down the horizon, I still see the refrax are going to be a big thing. Where, you know, how do we best accomplish, you know, the refrax and then make the improve the economics with the refrax as well. So, those are some of the three big things I see going forward here. So, Kyle, would you like to add your thoughts to that? Yeah, absolutely. Good morning. Thank you, Peggy and SP for inviting me to share with Mike and Karen. I think Mike hit on some of the big ones, the near term refrax are a focus. We know there's resource left behind that's economic to go recover with refracturing. I think in the same vein as the cluster efficiency that Mike mentioned, we can design the right hole size, shoot in the right direction. But if we don't do the kind of the tackling the basic things like cementing and gaining isolation behind our casing, the simple blocking and tackling that we sometimes don't talk as much about because it's not always as easy to measure. That could be a mute point if we don't have isolation. So, I think cement isolation, like Mike said, perforation efficiency and time. And then the other one that is not oil and gas but leverages hydraulic fracturing. I think we're going to see enhanced geothermal continue to grow and develop at a very rapid pace, borrowing much of what we've learned in the last two plus decades in oil and gas and applying it to geothermal. Thank you, Kyle. Karen, your thoughts? Hey, Peggy. Thanks for inviting me to be here with everybody today. You know, I think both Mike and Kyle hit on the big ones. The other thing that I see people focusing on right now is, of course, there's a lot of infill drilling and completions going on. And so there's a lot of parent-child or legacy well, new well interactions. And so I see a lot of operators focusing on how do they maximize the recovery out of these new wells that are sitting, that are sitting, being drilled right next to the existing legacy wells. Refracts, yeah, Mike touched on that. I think the really, you know, trying to optimize and maximize our recoveries with refracts is going to get bigger. And then the other thing besides the geothermal that Kyle mentioned on is I really think in the next five years or so, people are going to start going back to fields that we don't necessarily label as unconventionals right now. So I think we're going to start seeing operators going back to say, you know, old sort of conventional fields and placing horizontals in those wells and, you know, with producers and injectors to increase the recovery from those fields as well. Thank you, Karen. So yeah, so and I'm pretty sure, well, I'm sure that during the hydraulic fracturing technical conference, there will be lots of different technologies that will be discussed. And so that's an exciting venue. So I really look forward to that event and see where we're going to go in the industry. So I also want to talk to you about diagnostics. They've been a key in our understanding of hydraulic fracturing and our ability to drive for improvement. So what is one of the most surprising learnings from fracture diagnostics that you can share? So Kyle, maybe you can start. I'll touch on to the first one was part of the hydraulic fracturing test site too in the Permian. And the main surprise for us was the hydraulic height that was generated in that project. It was in excess of 1500 feet measured from fiber. So we had a vertical well. This is all published, a vertical well that had fiber optic cable permanently strapped to the outside of the casing. And you could watch that hydraulic geometry develop over time. And at the time we had most of our models were calibrated to less than 500 feet of hydraulic height. And that diagnostic completely changed our view as to how that geometry was being developed in the reservoir. And in that same vein, again, fiber has been tremendous for probably the last decade plus, as far as what it's done to help us understand how to improve our completion design. Like Mike mentioned, cluster efficiency. It's the best tool to measure in real time cluster efficiency and how things change over time. A few years ago when our cluster spacing was 30, 40, 50, 60 feet, the fiber resolution, spatial resolution was good enough for that. But as we've gotten tighter and tighter in our cluster spacing, we've had to lean on technology developments in fiber that have allowed us to decrease that spatial resolution, in some cases down to as tight as 20 centimeters, which has opened up our eyes to the complexity and how these fractures develop over time. Complexity and what I mean is asymmetry and that excess of height growth, like I mentioned, but also reiterates that overall the fractures themselves, the corridors are quite planar in nature. And looking forward, as much progress as we've seen in fiber in the last decade plus, I expect we'll continue to see that develop. And I think that next big breakthrough is going to be using fiber to measure change in pressure in the reservoir over time so we can have a tighter resolution on how we deplete that reservoir over time, which ties to the recent frac test site the DOE funded that Devin was able to host in the Eagleford that included a core through. And another surprising takeaway from that diagnostic was just how little propant we do place out into the reservoir, 250 feet away from our wells. So in our case, we had two horizontals that had been stimulated and we had a horizontal core through that occurred between those two wells. And you have to look hard through that core to find any propant. So again, all these diagnostics tend to lead to more questions and ah-hahs that sometimes lead to another diagnostic program to go try to chip away at understanding what's going on. So Karen, what has surprised you in diagnostics? Yeah, for me, I have, I would say there's two big ah-hahs that I've learned over these past 13 years is the one is, Kyle sort of touched on it, is that a lot of these unconventionals are more planar than we thought they were. That we are probably generating more planar fractures with maybe some beddy plain shear fracturing going on, but for the most part, planar. You know, we started these unconventionals in the Barnett and the Fayetteville and I think we started probably with the most complicated unconventionals you could find. That those were the ones that were creating these complex, complicated, you know, fractures. But as we've developed, moved on to different basins, what I'm seeing from diagnostics is that they're, for the most part, they're planar and we can match them quite well with just planar fractures. The second big ah-hah, and this is for me, and this is a big learning for me, was that anytime when we're pumping and we shut down, whether it's because we shut down to do a step, like we do a step-down test or we accidentally lose a pump and so we lose some rate and then we bring it back up, what I've seen, and I've seen this with fiber and also with SWPM, is that you never necessarily get all those clusters back. And so one of my big learnings is, it's like once you start pumping these jobs, don't stop. You know, I would not, you know, I know some people will argue with me, but from everything I've seen is every time you stop, you're going to lose some clusters and then when you get back into it, you never get them all back. So if you want to keep the maximum cluster efficiency you have, you know, don't shut down. Okay. So Mike, what's been the most surprising learning from your side? Yeah, I think I agree with some of the comments here. I think to add to Kyle's comment, he was talking about the height. A surprise for me has also been, you know, he talked about maybe the prop lengths being fairly short, but we have, it seems like a big discrepancy between the hydraulic length and potentially the prop length because a lot of the diagnostics are showing very long, you know, hydraulic fractures from a, you know, from a fluid perspective. It looks like we're creating very long fractures, but then yes, maybe the prop length or the effectively producing length is quite a bit shorter. So I think that discrepancy is a bit surprising to me, but then of course, giving, you know, all the complexity that is involved with hydraulic fracturing, the uncertainties, not surprising maybe, but I think that's something, you know, that's still key that we need to work on to figure out, you know, going forward. And then maybe a positive surprise for me has actually been when we look at the, some of the fiber data as we're fracking, you know, that we are breaking down most of the clusters as we're fracking. So I would have thought we're going to be not quite as good as what we actually see in reality. So, but of course, in terms of prop and distribution, et cetera, amongst the clusters, I think it's still not quite as uniform as we'd like probably in most cases. Yeah, maybe to add to what Mike's saying, I think that is like, I would call it the billion dollar question these days is where's the profit? You know, how do we really map where this profit is going and how far out is it going? And, and that I would say is the one, that's where we need some more diagnostic tools for is to locate where that profit is. Yeah, exactly. Reliable. A kind of brute force method to try to accomplish what Karen just mentioned, encourage the audience if you're looking for a diagnostic to consider would be setting a whipstock out in your lateral of a depleted well, maybe it's before a refrack near the end of its primary economic life, set a whipstock mill out and then perform a core through starting at the stimulated well. There's been several core throughs, some distance away from your horizontals. And with some of the ellipse of uncertainty, you can't pin down exactly where it is, but we're definitely not two, three, four or five feet away from the well bore with these core throughs. So someone's out there looking for a unique diagnostic that would help answer a lot of these questions. I'd encourage you to consider a mill out whipstock and core through from your stimulated well. Yeah, that's cool. Let's do that. So you guys are already sort of mentioning some of the exciting diagnostic things that you think are value adding. So what is, if you get to pick one thing or maybe two, I'm generous today. So exciting reading recent developments in fracture diagnostics, what would you mention, Karen, what from your perspective is the most exciting around diagnostic development? Yeah. Well, the first thing I like to say is I see a lot of people doing more diagnostics than they've done in the past. So I think that's fantastic. I think the sooner you can understand what's happening in your wells, you know, the better, you know, your recoveries are going to be in subsequent wells. So why wait until you've drilled hundreds? Let's figure it out sooner than later. But to me, one of the most exciting diagnostics is has been the SWPM, one of the sealed well bore pressure monitoring. Over 21,000 stages have been analyzed just in the last few years. So there's a lot of companies have picked it up. This was a this is a patented technology by Devon. So we got Kyle here with Devon that knows it better than myself. But I see it's a great diagnostic tool because you can see at least hydraulically, as Mike mentioned, you know, it's a fracture reaching those offset wells that you have a gauge on. And then the cost to do it is not that expensive compared to other diagnostic tools. And it's minimally invasive operationally, you know, because operationally, efficiencies is always, you know, one of our key parameters when we're doing these unconventionals. So Mike, what, what are your thoughts? Yeah, I agree with Karen. I thought it was exciting when we did some of the, you know, fiber monitoring and extended, you know, the in well fiber monitoring to the offset monitoring strain monitoring and kind of understanding, you know, how many fractures are actually coming across a certain distance. So that was kind of always exciting for me. So that was kind of always exciting for me. But then as Karen mentioned, I think, I think these days is moving to more cost effective diagnostics, such as sealed well bar monitoring, which could also give you a lot of the things, you know, that you can do with the the more expensive, you know, fiber monitoring. I think that's exciting that we find, you know, cost effective options to just do a lot more of the diagnostics and a lot more wells. And then I think from something I really like is the production diagnostics. So I think the techniques of, you know, looking at well interference as the wells are producing, such as chow pressure group is a technique that a lot of companies are using. I find that exciting because in the end, at the end of the day, when we're looking at infill drilling and optimizing well spacing, we have to understand how these wells are communicating while we're producing and potentially doing it over time, you know, not just one, you know, at one time in the life of the well, but at multiple times in the life of a field, you know, how are these wells communicating and interfering? I think that's going to be crucial for obviously understanding, you know, the well spacing optimization question. So Kyle, what are you most excited, developed diagnostics? 100% agree with Mike and Karen on what they've listed. You know, the overarching component that I'm excited about is the affordability, which allows for volume and the minimally invasive nature of these diagnostics. So Karen mentioned SWPM or crosswell strain for hydraulic geometries, not only when, but where and how many arrive at offsets. I mentioned CPG, we also have the Devon quantification of interference, which is slightly different, but it's after the same goal of quantifying interference between wells. The third one I'd add to the list that fits that bill of low cost and repeatable and time lapse like CPG and DQI is time lapse geochem. So you get your hydraulic geometries from SWPM, you can get your conductive overlap with CPG and DQI, and then that time lapse geochem can give you some insight into the drain height and how it changes over time. And then to add on to all of those, I'd say what I've been really impressed by Jackson Haftor on our team at Devon has done a tremendous job of putting this stuff together, making an image or a video that large groups of people can sit around and talk about and truly collaborate over. So I think it's low cost in nature, allows for a lot of volume, allows for code and processes to be developed to then ingest it and visualize it because a picture's worth a thousand words, a video is worth a whole lot more. And I think that's part of the reason that we've seen the adoption take off is because when you see it over and over again, you learn from it so much more rapidly and people can truly understand what's going on and make observations and then test quickly and see the results. So visualizations should not be undersold. I think it's one of the most crucial steps in a quality diagnostic program is putting it all together so the teams can understand it. Yeah, maybe Peggy, if you don't mind, you know, based on what Kyle is saying, one of my learnings over all these years is that you really don't want to just use one diagnostic tool. You know, if you're trying to figure, you know, something out and you always want to know what you're trying to figure out before you pick that diagnostic, you don't just go and do diagnostics to do it. You got to be doing diagnostics to answer questions or solve a problem, but you're going to, I always recommend that you get at least two diagnostics to answer whatever you're trying to figure out. So for example, if you're trying to do say fracture height, like Kyle mentioned, you're going to want to do two different diagnostics to answer that height question. You know, the vertical fiber, fantastic. That gives you a look all the way up. Just think of we had just you say, see a well-born, you just had a gauge 300 feet above you. Well, then that's all you would have seen. You wouldn't have seen it go all the way up. So I always recommend you want at least two diagnostic methods to answer whatever you're trying to figure out on there. And a lot of times they bring up more questions. And so you're going to want to do more, but you're going to be doing more diagnostics on the next well to figure out the next thing. You just go, well, what's happening? Why is this happening? What do I need to do to answer that? So nice. Thanks. Thanks, Karen. So I want to go to the last question before I go to the questions for the audience. So, and we've got a little time, so ask for a lightning round of thoughts. So, so what are your thoughts around real time data and how we that can improve our fracturing operations and our decision making, right? Karen sort of touched on, you know, collecting data to make decisions. So what's our greatest opportunity you see around real time data to improve our fracturing operations? So Karen, I guess I'll ask you first. Okay, thanks, Peggy. Yeah, just quickly, this is where I believe industry needs to be heading is to me the integration of real time diagnostics during operations. So right now we get the diagnostics and then we analyze it afterwards. And sometimes it can take us forever to analyze it. And then maybe six months later, before recommendations come out, I think we're heading in the direction where you're going to be looking at diagnostics real time. And the website supervisor or the engineer watching the job should be able to make real time or close to real time decisions. I'm going to talk about this at the hydraulic fracturing conference. I have a few videos because this is really sort of, you know, my vision of where I think we all need to be heading. So, so Kyle, you might be at your thoughts. I agree with Karen. I actually think we have the diagnostics today to make decisions. I think what we lack is a quality production log for, especially for liquid rich wells, because the challenge right now, you end up, we've, we found ourselves sometimes running in a circular loop, trying to make real time changes, but then discuss how do we measure the impact of the change. We know that there's a long list of variables that impact well performance. And if you're not able to go in and measure that stage and have a high confidence as to the performance of a particular stage based on a specific real time change, it's really difficult to complete that value equation to understand if I cut my stage short, short, or I add volume, and it costs this much or I saved that much, what's the impact on performance. And I think that's what our industry is lacking right now, as far as diagnostics. The one big ask is that we can get a diagnostic tool for liquid rich wells that can help us measure production down to a cluster level or a stage level at the very least. There's been several attempts and there's a lot of variability. Like Karen mentioned before, if you go run two different production logs in the same well today, it's not uncommon to see a 2X Delta in a stage. So we just don't have a reliable, affordable diagnostic that allows us to measure the impacts of real time changes. Mike and Karen both mentioned we have multiple low cost diagnostics to measure what's going on in real time with the stimulation. We've got the ability to stream data, we've got the ability to analyze treating pressure and all of the inputs, but what we don't have is a method to measure the impact of a change. So Mike, very quickly before you go. Yeah, I fully agree with what Karen and Kyle said and I think from our perspective, service companies is optimizing chemicals, for example, as we're pumping, for example, friction reducer, right? How do we optimize the pumping of the friction reducer concentration? And I think those are some of the low hanging fruits, getting the pump rate faster. Again, it's all about efficiency, ensuring that we pump the stage at the shortest amount of time possible and pump it successfully. So I see lots of opportunities there, kind of low hanging fruit. Thank you. So we'll move over to questions to the audience and I will say right now we will not be able to get to all of them. So I really look forward, I know all of us will be at the hydraulic fracturing technical conference, so please come there and hit us up and we'll be happy to talk some more. So a question and I apologize if I mispronounce your name from Faisal Al-Junabi. How to determine the associated risks of hydraulic fracturing to be extended vertically to the water zone? So what are some of the risks associated with, I guess, getting into zones you don't want to get into? Yeah, I mean, good question that is one of the big, you know, concerns is always vertically how our fractures are growing and like Kyle mentioned, obviously, you know, using diagnostic techniques. If you're in an area where you're very concerned about proximity of water, you know, some of the diagnostics we've mentioned are going to be crucial to understanding that. Of course, if you don't have the luxury of diagnostics or can't do them, you know, obviously, we've always resorted to fracture modeling sensitivities and you need very good earth models and stress profiles, you know, to understand potentially how the fractures could grow vertically and to minimize that risk of growing into a water zone. Obviously, growing into a water zone is definitely going to be a problem for well production, right? So you definitely want to avoid that. Yeah, I would add to what Mike is saying is, you know, if you have a water zone and you're afraid the fracture is going to grow down to it, A, you better understand your stress profiles and understand do you have any stress barriers between your producing interval and where that water is at. The other thing to think about is if you do a horizontal well in that interval, the pay interval, maybe you want to do it in the direction so that you're creating a longitudinal type fracture and not transverse. That may help you stay away from the water. So. And I want to grab one question that I know that we have an answer to from Pauline's Okonokwa. This is around the 1500 feet hydraulic height. So, Kyle, this one's for you. So, you know, was there an SP paper, you know, has there been publications? So please, please expand. There's been several, probably a dozen or more papers written on this from from HFTS too. So I'd encourage you to go out to OnePetro and just search HFTS-2 or space II. I'll grab one right now just so you have one to reference. There's an ERTEC paper, ERTEC 2020-1544. That's a nice one from from GTI that gives you an overall summary. But there's going to be a bunch of other papers referenced in that paper as well. So you'll see a lot of great work from several companies. Okay. So, well, thank you very much for the questions. Thank you, the audience for putting in your questions. Apologies for not being able to get to more. Thank you for joining us today, panelists and audience. So I would like to see you all at the Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Conference and thank you for attending today. I'll see you on February 6th."
ADNOC: Re-invention and Effecting Change,"I'm Jason Notouris and this is SBE Talks to Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SBE Podcast. If you haven't subscribed yet, we encourage you to do so. It's a great way to keep up with the latest oil and gas technical trends and valuable information. As is our monthly tradition, 2020 SBE President Shana Noonan joining us in studio to discuss her column. Thanks so much for being here. Oh, great to be here. We're going to talk unconventional resources, a hot topic globally, so we're really looking forward to talking about this. But I want to begin with South America, Argentina to be specific, that's going to be the host site for the upcoming SBE board meeting and it's your first presiding as president. Yes, something I've been not only excited and looking forward to, but also been working very hard in preparation for it. The March board meeting is usually has two very significant items on the agenda. One is to approve the budget. What a lot of people don't realize is SBE's fiscal year goes from April 1st to March 31st. So now we're looking at our overall budget for the starting April 1st of 2020. And then the second big item is approving the next slate of directors and the next SBE president. You'll be seeing some announcements about that right after the board makes those approvals. We can't get any teases in the podcast? No, no, no advanced knowledge. So why did you pick Argentina? Well, I picked Argentina for two main reasons. One has to do with membership. We have three fantastic sections in Argentina. And again, we have fantastic members. The thing is, there's so much more opportunity to actually have more members in those sections. And one of the things we struggle with, and it's not unique to Argentina, it's South America overall, is we struggle with not only retaining, but also growing our membership because most of the oil and gas companies down there don't allow their employees to expense their SBE membership. Or in some cases, they'll allow one membership, just like my employer did in Canada, and typically you go and expense the most expensive. At least in my case in Canada, when I would expense my obligation for the engineering association that was up there, I still on my own paid for my own SBE membership because I saw that as an investment in myself. And the unique thing with South America is that a lot of people don't really see the value in paying for an SBE membership themselves. And we do have different fee structures around the world. And in South America, we have probably one of the lower fee structures. And still, people just don't see the value in an SBE membership. So by bringing the entire board down there and to be doing some good face-to-face interactions and engagements with not only the current sections, but also to some of the bigger oil and gas companies, maybe we can start increasing our foothold down there. Yeah, and I'm looking forward to hearing your experiences and the board's experiences from this trip as well. I'm sure we can follow some of what you're doing on social media. So I'll go ahead and include your Twitter handle on there for people to see. As well as in the show notes of this episode, I'm going to put in the join and renew links for SBE just for anyone who may need to renew their membership still or is interested in joining and wants to see steps that they can take in order to do that. Excellent. Now, I just explained the one reason that I was bringing the board to Argentina. And the second reason is the subject of my column, which is increasing the knowledge transfer in Unconventionals. And this is a great continuation of your entire series, which is Strengthening the Core. So why are you specifying Unconventional resources in this column? Well, getting to the core, let's look at SBE's mission, where the first seven words are to collect, disseminate, and exchange technical knowledge. These are the three fundamental objectives of our society. And we proactively seek out the technical knowledge that not only our members need, but that the industry requires to meet the world's demand for oil and gas. Now, collecting this information can be challenging, especially if there are people out there who aren't willing or in some cases aren't even allowed to share it. And this proved especially challenging in the area of Unconventional shales when SBE started to hold conferences on it over a decade ago. Now, at that time, papers authored by knowledgeable operators were few and far between. And the rationale adopted by many operators was that technical information about their company's shale assets was actually confidential. And by withholding it, there was the mindset that they would gain some sort of competitive advantage. This was also very problematic for academia, who were trying to solve the complex problems of the unconventional reservoirs, but then they weren't getting access to the data. And any sort of data or research that were done with the universities too, in many cases, they weren't allowed to publish their works on it because the companies were requiring with the funding that that still remained confidential. So where are we seeing some of this data now? Because I know that some of the data has become a little bit more available as of late. It's slowly coming. And I want to give kudos to ConocoPhillips, who recently donated a cleaned and autonomized data set that comprises of drilling, completions, and other well data from their unconventional place to the University of Texas at Austin. This data donation allowed the UT professors to formulate real world data analytic problems for the student teams to solve. And the champion or the sponsor of this was ConocoPhillips CTO, Greg Lovell. And in my article, I have a quote from him where he states that the oil and natural gas industry is increasingly utilizing leading edge data science techniques to find, develop, and produce hydrocarbon resources more effectively. And ConocoPhillips believes it is important to support universities efforts to build programs to teach petroleum engineering students the fundamental and foundational data science skills they need to maximize their contributions to the E&P industry after they graduate. I want to mention too from my column last month about mentors, Greg Lovell is also a mentor for me as well. So not only is he a fantastic CTO for a great oil and gas company, but he's also been a great mentor for me and along with many others. I think that everything that you just mentioned there also speaks well into two months ago where you're talking about strengthening the feedstock because this is all coming full circle right now. In some aspects, I want to break a circle. And it has to do in the fact that the way we disseminate and exchange information, we've been getting better at it within SPE, but I really want to challenge is do we need to kind of not necessarily break the cycle, but even change course as to are we actually doing a good enough job with the way we disseminate? And then by looking at the unconventional resources, I'm challenging that are we even doing enough? Should we be doing more with the knowledge transfer of the unconventional shales? We'd actually like to hear your feedback on this. So if you have thoughts on that question, whether or not we should be doing more on the knowledge transfer to unconventional shales, send us a message on social media, use the hashtag SPE podcast. Love to talk to you about that. Where are some of these plays? Because sometimes I think that people get bogged down thinking that shale is a US thing, but it's so much more than that because this is actually happening all around the globe, right? Oh, definitely. And as I've been attending conferences around the world to unconventional seems to appear on everybody's agenda, even in Saudi Arabia at the IPTC, which was held there in January, there was several sessions just dedicated on the subject of unconventional. Now in my column, when I do focus on some of the different areas around the world, and of course, I do have to start with what you mentioned, the United States. And look, the shale revolution, it's made the US a top producer, and this has actually brought newfound energy security to the country. You know, the big event for knowledge dissemination in the US shales is the unconventional resources, technology exhibition and conference or otherwise known as ERTE. This is now an annual event, and it's a collaboration between SBE, AAPG, SEG, and then there's actually nine other endorsing organizations, and it has become very successful, and it brings the engineers and the geoscientists together. And that's something that's unique about the shales too, where the geosciences and the We have to be in collaboration with one another to unlock the potential of these shales. And I remember when ERTEK started in 2013, and it has actually moved around to different locations in the US, and it's become huge. The last one had more than 6,000 participants and over 300 technical presentations. The hydraulic fracturing conference too, which was just held in February, it was large too, I think it had almost 3,600 people at it. And of course, the topic of unconventionals was predominant all through that. So we do have a lot of events going on in the US, and a lot of knowledge being shared. It is growing in other parts of the globe, but I'd actually like to see it grow more. Well, let's go ahead and talk about those other regions. We have Australia. Now, most of the unconventional gas in Australia comes from coal seam gas reservoirs located in Queensland. But in 2018, the Northern Territory, the government lifted its moratorium against hydraulic fracturing, and now promising shale plays such as the Betelgeuse Basin, they're now being developed. But you know, it also they have their share of challenges such as hole stability during drilling, but still that basin shows tremendous potential. And building on the success of the ERTEC events in the United States, the very first international ERTEC was held just last fall in the city of Brisbane. And I was fortunate to attend this conference and learn more about what makes the shale basins in Australia and Asia Pacific unique. I do want to hear more about those unique basins, but it is time for a quick break. We'll be back more with 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan in just a moment.

Take yourself to greater depths right from your desktop with SPE online education. Learn more at webevents.spe.org. Welcome back to the SPE podcast. I'm Jason Notouris. We're in studio with 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan discussing Strengthening the Knowledge Transfer in Unconventional Resources, part of her series on Strengthening the Core. A minute ago, you mentioned the uniqueness of shale basins in Australia and the Asia Pacific. Can you give us an example? Well, I'd like to be more specific about China because here's a country too where the government sees the value of the unconventional basins in their own country, and they've actually set production targets and really pushing for the development of them. And there were several speakers from China at the event in Brisbane, and one of them in particular, he was an expert on the coal scene. And I had no idea all the different types of coal. But one of the, I guess, for lack of a better term, source rocks that they're trying to deal with in China is that the coal itself, the source rock, is almost like a powder. And so can you imagine even just trying to drill into that and have any amount of stability also at the same time? It's hazardous as far as igniting that coal. And yeah, it was quite fascinating. And we'll go ahead and if it is available, share the link to that in the show notes of this podcast. So let's turn our attention back to where you're having the board meeting in March. That's Argentina. A lot of discussion about the Vaca Morita there and the positive impact that it's having on the nation. About 23% of Argentina's total natural gas production actually comes from the Vaca Morita, yet only 4% of its acreage is actually in development. The second largest producer there now, it's a company called Vista Oil and Gas, and really they've only been around for just over a year. And they are the second largest producer in the Vaca Morita and only eight wells, which is amazing. So you can imagine the volume that's coming just from those eight wells. Now through the continued development of the Vaca Morita, Argentina has the potential to become less dependent on imports and strengthen its economy. Over the past year, I have traveled to Argentina to visit with active operators in the Vaca Morita to understand what SB can do to help them advance their technical understanding. With our extensive knowledge base, our support can ensure that they quickly ascend the learning curve by studying the successes and failures in other global basins. Along with the board meeting, I am using the power of my technical directors in that when I look to see who my technical directors were, I realized that I had basically subject matter experts and unconventionals as my technical directors. So what I'm doing a day ahead of the board meeting is a special strategic discussion with the technical directors, engaging with local operators and service providers to really figure out, okay, what's unique to Argentina? What are some state of the art innovations in all disciplines, drilling completions, production, reservoir that can actually have application to help those in the Vaca Morita get up the learning curve? When I mentioned at the beginning of this podcast, we're trying to show the value of being an SPE member. That one day strategic discussion, it's open for people to attend only if they're SPE members. Great incentive right there. A big part of my strengthening the core again is to increase the value of being an SPE member. I really think we give too much away for free and I'm trying to come up with more incentives, whether it's tools or events that only SPE members can access. Oh, and I need to mention with Argentina too, we've already talked about the bigger tech event in the US and how the first international one was in Brisbane. Well, the second international one is actually going to be in Buenos Aires this November. So I think the call for call for papers is out right now. And I highly encourage anybody that's either doing business in the Vaca Morita or wants to understand more about it that they actually go to that event. Yeah, the call for papers is open right now. The event takes place in mid November 2020. If you want to learn more, you can visit urtech.org Latin America 2020. We'll include that link in the show notes. Really need to see how much ERTEC is starting to move around as well. Well, they are and also too, SPE does have their own unconventional events as well. And there has been one and will continue to be one actually hosted by the SPE section in Argentina. And I believe that will be in the spring of 2021. Even though we're sharing and we're publishing more and more information about the unconventionals, there's still so many pieces of it that remain unsolved. Each January issue of JPT, they have the technical directors talk about what their challenges or their outlook is for the year. And I highlighted comments from both our reservoir technical director as well as our completions technical director. Now, our technical director for reservoirs, Dr. Ertl Oskan from Colorado School of Mines. And he was quoted as saying that he believes the industry has placed so much effort into the unconventionals that it's neglected the advancement of reservoir technologies. And then our technical director for completions, Terry Pollach with Carbo. He was quoted as saying that as unconventional space matures, both problems and solutions are becoming more complex and that we're trying to figure out how do we go from a 10% to a 50% recovery in a sustainable manner. And I do want to add that there was a whole panel at the very end of the hydraulic fracturing conference put together and the room was packed. And you know it's a hot topic when it's the last thing at the end of the day at the end of a conference and everybody is still there. The standing room only. Standing room only. And it was featuring the topic of casing deformations. And it was actually highlighted to I believe in the January or the February J.P.T. But this is a common problem across all basins. We're seeing casing deformation issues in China as well as the U.S. and Canada. So again that's something that we haven't figured out yet. And there's so many commonalities like that because so often you hear, well this is how they're doing it in Saudi Arabia but there's no way that will work in my situation in Canada or someone else may say from the Permian, well I'm not going to be able to replicate the success of what's happened in either North or South Africa. Why do we need to take those statements with a grain of salt? And are they even really that valid or is it just an easy excuse to kind of lay a crutch on? Jason you hit the nail on the head in the fact that we need to eliminate this mindset of if it's not invented here it won't work. And I hear that a lot in the unconventional space. We need to stop developing in geographical silos and become open to the potential that there may be lessons to be learned from other basins around the world. Yes granted the rock is not identical. However we should be open to the fact that there could be one valuable nugget to be learned from one basin that can be used in another. And as far as the geographical silos we also need to stop operating in functional silos. Now this process of extracting hydrocarbons from these complex reservoirs they require a relentless collaboration and I've mentioned the collaboration about between the engineers and the geoscientists but this is expanding it to collaboration between operators, service providers and members of the academic community. And it's more than just submitting papers to OnePetro in hopes that our members will find the content. We must hold events in these developing basins and proactively provide our members with the latest technology and applications to be successful. And that's what I'm doing with this technical directors event in Buenos Aires is trying to be proactive with getting the latest innovations from the subject matter experts into Argentina and help with the Vaca Morta. Now being a member of SB allows us to think bigger. You know far beyond generating cash flow and shareholder returns. By being more proactive and strategic with our knowledge transfer I think that is part of the bigger picture. We are a part of the energy solution that will eliminate energy poverty and increase the global standard of living and the unconventional shales they're a significant part of us being able to deliver on that. Now we all need to work together to eliminate these steep learning curves in all these basins so that no one starts near the bottom. And it all begins with proactively and openly doing what we say in SPE's mission statement which is collecting disseminating and exchanging technical knowledge. So I'm glad that you bring all that up because SPE does offer a variety of membership benefits that are exclusive to the SPE members and SPE Connect is one of them. The e-mentoring program which is a really great initiative where you can connect one on one globally with someone who could help advance your career or if you're a mentor giving back to the industry that's given you so much there's also the competence management tools. So what else is there out there that is exclusive to SPE members? Well one that we've launched just last fall was the app the SPE app. You can only access the content on it through that tool and that's one of the I guess actions that the board is acting on and also trying to build on this year is creating more content and tools that will be unique just for SPE members. Now stay tuned with the app that's on the phone because there is going to be a lot more associated with it and also stay tuned to some of my future columns and actually future podcasts because I'm not going to reveal yet what those exclusive items for SPE members are going to be. You'll just stay tuned. You're getting all giddy just like trying to hold that not actually telling us what's going to be there so I am excited to find out. I'm also in mystery right now not knowing what new is coming and what will be rolled out in the future but the anticipation is there. Question of the month is next but first let's just take one last break. SPE members get up to a 50% discount in the SPE bookstore. Visit store.spe.org to look for your next reading material and watch out for SPE's new book Hydraulic Fracturing Fundamentals and Advancement. Welcome back. In coordination with Shana's column each month we also like to ask you the listener a question. We'll even be reading some of the responses on future podcasts. So here we go. The question of the month, what topics do you think SPE needs to be more proactively addressing towards members? All right. We want to hear from you on this so email your responses to president at SPE.org. That was what topics do you think SPE needs to be more proactively addressing towards members? Shana, thanks so much for being here today to discuss your column. Great conversation back and forth. I love how we can talk about events and membership and how they all relate to one another and at the end of the day I'm picking up a big sense of the theme of collaboration. Definitely and when you're mentioning the thank yous and question of the month I'd actually want to put out a huge thank you to all the members that have been responding to my questions. I think the one article that created the most I guess conversation or dialogue between myself and members was the January topic on attracting and retaining the top talent. I got a lot of tweets as well as emails from some members with very interesting stories and also viewpoints on how SPE can continue to attract that top talent. All right thank you so much everyone listening let's keep the conversation going use the hashtag SPE podcast to reach us on social.

"Price War Update, Offshore in Survival Mode, New Tech for Drillers, and Energy Workforce Survey","Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the August 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future. And now your moderator, Austin Palish. Hello, I'm Austin Palish, staff engineer at Liberty Energy, and I'm pleased to join 2024 SPE President and my dad, Terry Palish, on his monthly podcast episode. Since this is the last episode of your presidency, I think maybe we can review the year so far, your theme of creating our energy future and talk about the future of SPE. I just want to say it's a true honor to be on this podcast today, so thank you for inviting me to join you, Dan. Well, Austin, thank you. I know you're super busy. I know you have a lot of things going on with your job and things, but I am excited that you were able to make this work. You know, as you said, I started my term with the theme of creating our energy future, and I pretty much use this as a basis for my talks and my presentations over the past year, particularly as I've traveled across the world, meeting both professional and student members and, you know, as well as those who I consider our external stakeholders. And, you know, to me, I think that in addition to our students, a huge part of this future and our future lies with the next generations of professionals that are in our industry, and in particular the young professionals like yourself. So, you know, from my last episode, I knew I wanted to bring a YP on, and I figured, well, okay, so who better than my son who decided to follow in my footsteps in petroleum engineering and into the industry? So thanks for taking the time, and I'm excited that we can make this work. Yeah, me too. I'm happy to be here. I mean, I remember when I was going to college, I knew I wanted to do some kind of engineering, but didn't really know what flavor. So you told me just to try out petroleum, see how it goes. And after my first summer internship, I kind of knew that this was the industry for me. And now, looking back on it, after working six years in Frac across five different basins in the US, I know I made the right choice. It's been plenty challenging at times, as well as exciting working in this industry, but knowing that we're bringing energy to the world and making a difference is extremely rewarding. So anyways, speaking of all your traveling, where have you been since your last episode? Anything you want to share? Sure. It's been a busy month. You know, earlier this month I attended the Oil and Natural Gas Technology Symposium in Washington, DC. This is another event we put on with our sister societies, both AAPG and SCG. And this one was largely run by the many of our international capital section in DC. This was actually the third edition of this symposium, and this year's scene was entitled Sustainable Energy for Future Generations. And it was held in the US Capitol Visitor Center, so that was really cool. It's a unique event. This event really tries to bring together senior technical leaders, governor policy makers. I think we had think tanks and associations to exchange best practices in sustainable energy and then of course develop strategies to solve. You know, we started off by talking about what sustainability really meant. It was really an eye-opening session. And then we kind of worked into the evolving energy streams and you know how critical our industry will be and is. And then of course we ended with a YP session or a panel that we discussed the future workforce. So that was a really cool way to end things. But you know, I thought it really hit home with my theme of creating our energy future. The volunteer organizers of course did a great job and a huge thank you to our sponsors. So as you know, as we speak, I'm in the middle of my multi-week visit to Europe. It began with a visit to Drobrovnik, Croatia, where I helped kick off the petroleum engineering summer event, school event, targeting energy and geothermal and really kind of how our industry is adjacent and how we can help move this technology forward as an important energy source. After that, I went to Paris for a couple days. I kicked off and participated in a panel hosted by the French section entitled Generational Diversity in the Workforce. And you know, we talked not only about the importance of having generational diversity in our teams, but also just how we need to understand the differences between the generations and appreciate everyone's perspective on the industry. Then it was off to Vienna. We met with senior leadership at OMB, who's a very important sponsor in the region and partner with us, including here at Europe, which is where I'm at at the moment. And then we have, I of course helped kick off their annual event by the Vienna Basin section held in Bratislava, Slovakia. It's a great event, great speakers, and we even recognized a few milestone anniversaries for SP membership. One member who had who had 35 years of continuous membership, so that was really neat. Went over to Turin, Italy, where I'm at now. I spent a day in Milan where we met with the Italian section. Met with the geologues offices there. I got to hear about the events and the programming they have going on. So that was fun. It was, I don't know, the last time the president had been there, so they were excited that I was able to come. And then of course we'll be headed to a 30th anniversary in Romania, Germany, a couple events in UK, and then wind up in Stamanger for the board meeting. So it's been a super busy month, but I'm always excited. It's been really fun to travel around this particular Europe and meet with our YPs and our students and our professional members. Yeah, well, definitely a lot of traveling. Sounds very busy, but I'm sure it's plenty rewarding and exciting meeting everybody and seeing some cool places along the way too. Just one of the cool opportunities that this industry presents to everyone who's a part of it, being able to travel and meet people and see some things along the way. So before we dive into any questions further, could you kind of give a brief refresher on your theme you've mentioned a few times? Creating our energy future and what that means? Yeah, I think we talked a little bit about this on the first episode, but this title was actually the title of my very first presentation to students. I think it might have been Texas A&M. I just wanted to help them understand what it takes to be successful in the future, which is what most students and young professionals want. They want a long-term career. And I also wanted to talk a little bit about how SPE was critical to that journey. And I quickly realized after talking to Paige Wilson about this, she said, well, I think you have a theme. And so I realized as president-elect that there are really two futures at stake, our members and then of course of SPE. And they really go hand in hand. And if SPE can help our members create their energy future, then by definition, we'll be creating SPE's futures as well. So it's been the primary emphasis and really the primary reason driving force why I started these podcasts. I wanted to educate our members not just on what we offer, but how to get the most out of their SPE membership. So each month, of course, we've discussed a different topic, a different aspect, and we've talked about how to use them and how to professionally develop yourself. So if you know, as a listener, if you haven't listened to all of them or if you've missed some, I encourage you to go back, pick an episode of some programming and learn about it, or maybe ask your colleagues to take a listen of how they can benefit from becoming a member or maybe even some colleagues that aren't members to help them. Understand the benefits of and what you can get out of it. So, you know, I'll just close this real quickly by saying, you know, I talk about this a lot, but, you know, thinking about your SPE membership like a gym membership, you know, the gym is for your physical well-being, SPE is for your professional. And the more you put in each one of those, the more you're going to get out. So you share this thing with many people across various platforms, and how do you think it's been received both through the podcast as well as your travels? Well, I'm probably biased, of course, but I feel like it's landed well. I've certainly been quoted on many times on social media. You know, I've of course been thanked in person by attendees. A lot of them say they really connected with the idea of thinking about this is important to professional development. A lot of them have said that they really felt moved by, you know, how the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. So I thought it seems like it's landed well, you know, I've said, you know, to have a future, you need the key on four things, engaging in lifelong learning, participation in our industry, volunteerism and leading. And I think for me and I think for many members, SPE is the perfect way to accomplish this. So I think that part has really resonated well with YPs, and I've gotten a lot of good feedback from students on that. I think what's been really interesting for me is that, you know, I wasn't sure how this theme would land in various regions, but it seems to have fit well everywhere I've gone and every event I've spoken with. You know, I might have modified it a little bit and adapted a little bit to the local culture, but, you know, regardless of the audience or the location in the world. And by the way, this is the same thing, saying something given how diverse our society is. But wherever I've been, whether it's been West Texas or Europe or the Middle East or Asia Pacific, Canada, Africa, or even down under in Australia, all seem to be passionate about their careers. They're all passionate about their professions. They're all have passion about their goals and they recognize the importance of our industry and our profession to supply the world with affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. So I guess time will tell how well it's gone, but at least so far I feel like it's gone. It's been landed well. So kind of speaking on what you just mentioned there that the energy trail, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy, which I know you like to refer to the energy opportunity for our industry because clearly our industry plays a critical role in the production of hydrocarbons to provide the world with both affordable and reliable energy. What challenges do you say we face in respect to meeting those two particular needs? Well, look, first of all, your company led by Chris Wright is one of those in the forefront of this discussion. As you well know, Liberty Energy promotes a concept of bettering human lives, whether it be economic or energy poverty or living conditions. Humanity always wants to climb the energy ladder because it climbs the standard of living ladder. And, you know, by doing so, their quality of life improves. And ironically, the environment typically improves after that. So as you said, the products we produce, oil and gas, they continue to lift the world out of energy poverty and are still some of the densest and most dispatchable energy forms along with coal, only eclipsed really by nuclear. So the hydrocarbons we produce, the products that come from it, they're going to be critical to meeting the growing energy needs of all nations. And then of course, in particular, some of the developing nations, particularly countries like China and India, as well as Sub-Saharan African countries, for many decades to come, certainly past mine in your lifetime. So, you know, once a person's energy demands are met, it typically leads to them being able to improve the environment. So as such, I think it's imperative that we as engineers continue to advance technologies to sustainably produce the energy that we need. The challenge, though, is that we must continue to engineer ways to do this. Think about, you know, like offshore. Offshore is actually produces some of the lowest carbon, oil and gas. And think about how we've been pushing the envelope to drilling deeper water. We we're confident there's more to be discovered. In fact, in some cases, we know there's more there, but we just need the advancements to get deeper. I mean, right now we can drill in a mile plus of water. We need to get deeper. Or we could think about unconventional reservoirs like what you work on, you know, shale gas, shale oil. I mean, as you know, they completely change the energy landscape in North America and really by definition the world these last 20 years. I mean, the U.S. went from a net importer of oil and gas to a net exporter and one of the largest producers of both in the world. And this technology is now being replicated in other areas like South America and China. Even the Middle East is looking at unconventional development. So the challenge for your generation and for the students that are coming in is what's next? What's going to be the next big breakthrough? And so in order to come up with these breakthroughs, the big key is we're going to need the best and the brightest coming into our industry. Of course, we need the capital investment and, of course, public support. So that's our challenge. And I'd probably say this is kind of what SB is all about, right? Kind of working towards these technological advancements and bringing people together. Yeah, clearly. I mean, SB is the home for petroleum engineers and engineers that work in our industry that help move the petroleum industry along. The scientists, professionals. Like our mission, I've said it multiple times, is to connect our members to technology, connect our members to the world, connect our members to the world. And our mission, I've said it multiple times, is to connect our members to technology, connect our members to each other and to our external stakeholders. You know, of course, as we facilitate this through many events, print media, multimedia, I don't know, technical and regional sections. All these are the subject I've covered in my podcast. And, you know, we not only facilitate classic petroleum engineering disciplines like reservoir and drilling and completions, but also H, health, safety, environment, sustainability, facilities and management. Those are all facilitated. And then, of course, in addition now we're leaning into the advancement of data science and engineering. I mean, that's something that's in all the disciplines. So we continue to find ways to leverage DSNA, ENA, in all aspects of our business. Awesome. So, like, we've kind of addressed the portable and reliable legs of this energy challenge, as you like to call it. But what about there's the third leg, bringing sustainability and decarbonization into the mix, you know, something that I know we all as an industry want to push towards. And I've heard you say before our industry is uniquely positioned to address this as well. Can you explain how? Well, look, I think there's two parts to this. First, we need to continue to find ways to decarbonize our operations. There's a lot of ways we're working on this. They include things like reduction, particularly of our scope one and scope two emissions, whether it's reducing or eliminating flaring or reducing methane emissions, addressing orphan wells. These are just a few of the many avenues our industry is working for decarbonization. We have to continue to find technologies to accomplish this. We've made tremendous progress, but I think more work can be done. Of course, there's other ways, reducing emissions from things like our solar panels. We've made significant progress in reducing emissions from things like our drilling rigs and frac operations, whether it be through electrification or conversion from diesel to natural gas, like your company's doing, or even the deployment of renewables to some of our activities. You know, these are just a few examples, I think, of how we can decarbonize, you know, how we are decarbonizing and how we can ultimately reduce our carbon footprint and lead to greater sustainability. The other part, though, is we can use our oil and gas expertise to advance some of the adjacent decarbonization technologies. And what I mean by that is that, you know, two that immediately come to mind are carbon capture and storage and geothermal. The subsurface, you know, and the surface engineers or industry, you know, they're critical to the success of both. Both CCUS and geothermal have been around for decades, even centuries, if you take geothermal. The Romans were doing it back in Rome using geothermal in Roman times. But until now, you know, both are really significantly underutilized compared to what they could be and really compared to what they're going to need to be. So the expertise of our industry, our engineers, our geoscientists, you know, we're actively addressing one of the key concerns with carbon capture and storage. And that is the permanent storage part of this and the permanent storage at scale. And so we need to work that part of it. We have to bring the costs down and we have to understand just how to do this. And then, of course, for geothermal, I think it's just as exciting. And that's the application of our unconventional resources development, you know, drilling horizontal wells, and maybe particularly adding multi-stage hydraulic fracturing treatments. It's been successfully demonstrated now in the EGS scenario. In fact, I think your company's been doing a lot of work with projects like Forge and Fervo. Of course, we have many other aspects of that that we are working. So, you know, again, that's why I believe that we, those in our industry, like you said, are uniquely positioned to solve the energy trilemma or the energy challenge. And in fact, I like to think of it as our energy opportunity. Yeah, so those are a bunch of great ways that the industry is leaning into this sustainability opportunity. What's SBE been doing? Has SBE been supporting this too? Absolutely. You know, let me start with some statistics. I always like to lead with some data. So, the 2023 SP president, Med Kamel, he actually had the same question. He thought, let's put some metrics to this. And so he did a little research with SP staff and just kind of took what did we do in 2023 last year, the first full year or last full year, excuse me. So, in looking at the year, almost 10% of our events, our primary events, were actually focused solely on energy transition topics. But then on top of that, a majority of our events, maybe all of them, had sessions that address energy transition or sustainability topics directly. And then on top of that, things, there were also conferences that had energy transition topics embedded within a particular session that wasn't necessarily for that. So, you know, I think it's important to remember that if we can start embedding this discussion into our everyday work, like we do safety, we can continue to move forward. In 2023, you know, we continue to partner with our external stakeholders, like AAPG and SEG, to bring the carbon capture and storage symposium. In 2023, we actually worked on expanding it outside of Houston. We held that in Rio earlier this year after the planning in 2023. Last year, of course, we also continued our partnership with Geothermal Rising to put on our annual geothermal workshop. So that's our events for 2023. If you look at papers in 2023, almost 10% of the papers in OnePetro that went into OnePetro dealt directly with sustainability. And almost half of those were dealing with renewables themselves. And so, you know, it's important to remember we've been addressing sustainability for decades. We've had a sustainability technical section for quite some time, and it's been an important topic. It's interesting. We did a little more research. You know that in 1969, there was a OnePetro paper that was discussing geothermal. So we've been looking at sustainability topics for a while. Speaking of geothermal, of course, in 2023, we announced our selection for being awarded the Geode Project. This is set to kick off any day now. Geode is a DOE, a United States Department of Energy funded project that we, along with Geothermal Rising and of course, Project Interspace, is the principal investigator. You know, we'll be looking at the key goal of that Geode Project is to advance geothermal technology quickly. And by doing that, by leveraging the oil and gas industry expertise. So SPE will work together with the other entities to bring that to bear. So that's 2023. Of course, we continue to have our technical sections. I think they're one of the bright spots of new things. You know, we're up to 23 total technical sections. Of course, we talked about this. They include carbon capture, geothermal, hydrogen, methane emissions, sustainability, and we continue to add to that. And they've really been a big success. So yeah, I think SPE is leaning into sustainability and if you want to call it energy transition, we have been doing that as well. And we continue. And again, it's why I believe we're uniquely positioned. And by the way, you know, I just want to remind people that this is in response to what our members are asking for. I mean, we're a member organization. Our members want this as well. Our members' companies are doing this. Our sponsors and advertisers are doing it as well. So we continue to try to meet our constituency's needs. Wow. Well, definitely sounds like we as an industry and SPE as well are all addressing evolving and kind of rising up to this energy challenge. So it's all great to hear. So let's kind of shift gears a little bit here. I was at ATC when you took the gavel from Ed Comal in San Antonio last year. So I heard you talk. I know you had you had some goals set out for your presidency. Just wanted to see how those have gone. Well, look, I think we've already addressed one of my primary goals. And the primary goal was just really trying to help members understand how to get the most out of their membership. So that's what drove the creating our energy future. I tried to spread the word on this with my talks and speeches. It's also what led to the topics on the podcast. And I guess, you know, how successful that's been, I guess, will remain to be seen. I'll say that again, recent membership survey that we did agrees that we have a challenge here with helping members understand the value of some of our programming. So, you know, hopefully this is a start of doing that. And I hope that I've been helped to improve it. Let's see. I also think we've had largely addressed regaining the financial stability post-COVID. In fact, we ended fiscal year 23 in March actually in the black, if you combine it with our investment performance. And, you know, at this point in time, if we stay on track with the budget expectations for fiscal year 24 and 25, I think we should be back to a two year net positive. So, you know, we're only a few months into fiscal year 24, but so far we're at or slightly better than budget. Another goal was, of course, reimagining some of our flagship events. The first one we started with, of course, was ATCE. I want to encourage everybody to come to ATCE. We've got a lot of new things planned for New Orleans. And then, of course, depending on how those go, we'll continue to build off that for the future ATCE and also take it over to some of our other events. You know, another goal I had was to really continue to support our sections and chapters. And, you know, don't get me wrong. I think we're doing fine here, but I hope that we can do more in the future. Perhaps maybe there's more collaboration between our SP events and programming in the local sections. I think that we can build and leverage off each other in both benefit. You know, I've said this before, but, you know, for many, if not most members of SPE, when they think about SPE, they're thinking about our local sections. They're the face in our future. So it's important that we work together with them. You know, and then lastly was kind of the long shot was Energy for Me. You know, I really, I think we have a lot of really good opportunity here with Energy for Me. It's such a great program. And I think that hopefully we can look for ways to upgrade this now in the future. You know, I'd like to see us potentially expand it down into some younger ages to try to impact the STEM education there, as well as maybe help use it to educate some of our professionals. So that then they can use this information to go out into industry, maybe in their local regions and help promote the industry. You know, the recent member survey, again, I mentioned it before, really highlighted the challenge we have. We don't have as high of awareness with Energy for Me, which was really a very much of a surprise for me. So, you know, I know in discussing with Simon when I began that we thought it might be very hard to do much this year. We had a lot of irons that we had in the fire. So my goal is to at least get this on the radar, which I think we've done. We've actually talked about maybe starting some discussions with us at the summer board meeting here in a couple weeks. You know, now that our finances are in order and hopefully we can really start looking hard at this particular initiative and really continue to upgrade it because it's a great initiative. And what's interesting is that those that do know about Energy for Me and use it have a huge positive understanding of it. So it's a very successful program. Yeah, definitely sounds like it. Well, I think we might be just about out of time here. So let's kind of bring it all together and bring give me some of your thoughts on the future of SPE. Well, look, every one of my presentations, if I have a PowerPoint, my last slide says our future is bright. And I think it is. I'm super excited about it. I mean, as I've gone out and talked to people, you know, I've said this many times, but again, our professional and student members, they've been very, very supportive. They're passionate, passionate about what they do, our industry, they're passionate about SPE. And, you know, I think passion is what's important for our future. You know, I just met with our new board members. They are a diverse, energetic group of volunteers who are ready to roll up their sleeves and work with those of us that are on the board and really build on the work of their predecessors who, again, I want to thank for all the work that they've done. I know it's a long three years, but it's been great working with them and they've done, they've left their mark on the society. You know, I think having the finances largely behind us is huge. And while we still need to continue to be vigilant and work hard in this arena, I think we can now start looking at diverting our attention a little bit more to looking for ways to continue to deliver valuable programming to our members. You know, particularly, you know, incorporating the results of the membership survey. And look, in the end, I think that if we can be successful at continuing to meet the mission of connecting our members, supporting both our core of sustainable development in oil and gas, as well as our partner in the adjacent technologies and the energy evolution or energy transition, I think our members will thrive. I think our industry will thrive. I think SBE will thrive. And ultimately, I hope and think that we can create our energy future. Well, definitely sounds like you're excited about it. I'm excited and looking forward to see what the future holds for the industry as well as SBE. So what's left for you in September here? Well, first of all, Austin, this has been a lot of fun. Thanks for joining me. And also let me say how proud I am of you and happy that you can do the final episode with me. So look, being president has been a once in a lifetime opportunity. It's clearly been a lot of work. But also it's been professional fulfilling and certainly one of the pinnacles of my career. But, you know, it's just important because I think SBE has provided me so much benefits and opportunities. And it's also for the benefit of not just my career, but also the companies I've worked for. And in the end, look, I just want others to have that same success and hopefully have that same impact from SBE. As far as September goes, of course, this is my last podcast. So next month you'll get to listen to Olivier Hussain, the next president, 2025. I'm not going to spoil any of his surprises. I know he's been looking at trying to carrying on some of this tradition, but I think looking at even upgrading it further. So I'm excited about that. But, you know, I travel won't stop. I've got a lot of trips still planned the rest of this year, and I've got starting to look at some things next year as well. So hopefully I'll be able to go out and meet some more members, more student members and continue to support SBE. So since it's my last podcast, I want to just thank everybody for listening. I hope they've been helpful and thanks for your support. And thanks again, Austin. It's been a lot of fun talking to you today. Yeah, same here. Thanks for having me. It's been great to be a part of this. Sure, we will all thank you for your service so far and look forward to the continuation of what you started. So just thanks again for allowing me to be here. All right. Thanks, Austin. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the SBE Presidents Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts, on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
At a Crossroad - Today's Energy Workforce,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the June 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future, the crucial role of soft skills in engineering. And now your moderator, Susan Howes. Hello, I'm Susan Howes, president of Subsurface Consultants and Associates. And I'm pleased to join 2024 President Terry Palich on his monthly podcast episode. This month, Terry and I will focus on the importance of soft skills for engineers and how SPE can help you in developing these critical skills. Thanks Terry for the invitation to join you. Well thank you, Susan. I'm excited for today. You know, as I kind of thought about who we might, who I might partner up with for this episode, I thought you'd be a perfect fit. You obviously clearly lead a very successful international consulting firms. So you know the importance of soft skills. I think you actually promote them as well in SPE. Obviously, you're very active as an SPE member, having served on the board and the Gulf Coast section and now on the ATC program chair. So I'm excited that you were able to join me. You know, the listeners may recall last month, we talked about petroleum engineering education, academia, the students, things like that. And while you'll certainly learn all most or all of the technical skills there, sometimes we forget about the other skills that are necessary for success in the business and in life. And those are what we call soft skills. And of course, I'm an engineer. So if you're like me, soft skills maybe aren't really in our wheelhouse. So we maybe have to think a little bit harder about developing those skills. But I also thought, you know, along those lines, I think as we develop the soft skills, a lot of it we get from volunteering. So I think we can talk a little bit about volunteering, of course, with SPE. Benefits not only SP, but you personally. So I think that's what we got on the agenda for today. Wonderful. Before we get started, Terry, I know you have been busy, including the spring board meeting in Australia. Is there anything you'd wish to share about your travels? Yeah. It has been a busy spring between IPTC and OTC Asia, the drilling conference, Canadian conference. And then I've been trying to get to as many student chapters and sections. It has been busy. We did just complete the spring board meeting. I was able to visit some of the sections in Sydney, Melbourne and Western Australia. But you know, it was a good meeting. We ended up, we did close the books on fiscal year 24. We did have a net operating loss. It was less than it was last year. But the nice thing is overall, we actually broke even when you combine it with the reserve fund earnings. And that's the well, we don't want the net operating loss. But this is the first time since before COVID that we actually saw that. So we're excited about that. Just before the board meeting, we, of course, approved FY 25 budget. We look at things on a two year cycle because of different events. And it looks like, you know, based on the hard work that staff did, we should be break even starting the next couple of years. So that's exciting. It helps us be able to start really focusing on member benefits. And speaking of which, we got saw some of the first results of the membership survey that was recently completed. We had a really good turnout for that. We'll be kind of releasing and relaying some of those results here soon. So we're currently digesting those results, trying to understand what they mean. The bottom line is we'll use that to kind of help structure the strategic plan and use it as a guide for future programming and offerings. And of course, I'm sure as most people saw, we also just approved and saw the new slate of nominees for the board. So we're excited for that. There was just so many qualified candidates. So that was exciting. And I just want to offer my congratulations to Jennifer Miskimmons and the rest of the nominees. Yeah, wonderful news. I had the chance to congratulate Dr. Miskimmons in person last week. So she's very excited about her opportunity. So getting back to our subject, what are soft skills? Yeah, you know, I think that, you know, probably there's probably some similarities, but there's probably some that people probably disagree what we call them. For me, I'm just going to call them the non-technical skills. The two most popular probably people think of is just their technical writing and everything that goes along with that, as well as speaking and presenting. But I think sometimes we need to remember that leadership skills is another good one, another big one, actually. So the skills we need to lead teams, lead businesses. And then another one I like to put in there is our networking, collaborating. We really have to learn to work together as teams if we want to really excel and develop technology. So, you know, I kind of think of it as those four items. Wonderful. And I know you have an interesting story about soft skills from early in your career. Can you share that with us, please? Yeah, you know, when I speak out in public, I usually say that the secret, which is probably I guess not going to be a secret anymore. But you know, when I first started in the industry, I worked for ARCO Alaska. And as a part of your training program, you kind of go around to the different disciplines. And I remember I still distinctly remember my when I did my facility engineering tour, my supervisor at the time, a great supervisor. But you know, she basically told me on my performance evaluation, you really have terrible speaking skills and you really can't write. And I thought, well, that's why I'm an engineer. But you know, at the time, I didn't think it was important. Certainly over my career, I think I've improved those. But it was that it was that was when the first time I was really told, look, you really need to work on those. And so why are soft skills so important to engineers? Sometimes they're called critical skills. Yeah, I mean, I think they're critical skills because that's what they are. Maybe it might be easier to just kind of break out down each of the four individually. Technical writing, you know, as engineers, we can have some really good ideas, develop some really great technologies. Maybe we get the next best thing of whatever. But, you know, how do you memorialize and preserve your work for others? How do you convey it to your colleagues so that they can maybe apply it to their challenges? Or, you know, what if somebody wants to implement your technology? How do we instruct them to do that? So, you know, we need to write it down. It needs to be readable. You need to be able to follow it needs to be able to explain what you need to do. You know, one of the things we talk about in my SP abstract class, we start with the importance of why to write a paper. Obviously, we talk about writing SP papers, but, you know, that's one of the first things we talk about. Actually, one of the things we also mentioned in that class, and I think that's something people don't think of a lot is, you know, technical writing. We think of technical reports, documenting a specific idea, maybe an SP paper. But really, every time you write an email at your company to colleagues or what have you, I mean, that's actually technical writing. You should really treat that as if, you know, you and I, when we were, of course, starting out, we had what we called memos, that pieces of paper that went around the office. And, you know, we spent a lot of time thinking about what to write. And now we write emails. And so we really need to treat emails that way as well. You know, moving into speaking and presenting. You know, again, we need to be able to communicate our ideas effectively. You know, I had a supervisor at ARCO again, who may be one of the smartest people I ever knew, but was a basket case in front of people during a presentation to the point that it was actually distracting. You know, I've seen many engineers, particularly those that have really good SP papers, great ideas, but, you know, pulling a PowerPoint together is a struggle and actually ends up hurting their idea. So, you know, speaking and presenting are critical. You know, leadership, you know, while I think technical writing, speaking and presenting, they're all critical skills that everybody needs to develop. You know, not everybody is going to want to be a leader. And that may not be for everyone. So so leadership, you could argue, is not necessary. But certainly, if you decide you ever want to manage a team or lead an organization or perhaps maybe you want to run your own company, then leadership skills are going to be critical to be successful. As you know, there are plenty of books out there that talk about these types of skills and how important they are. And then I guess if we work in move into networking collaboration, you know, depending on your job, there's certainly going to be times where you might work by yourself on a project. But I'm going to say that most people will work in teams. You may remember years ago, we talked about these multidisciplinary teams and, you know, how we work together. And, you know, there's a lot of teamwork books out there where they talk about different personalities and things like that. So there is some skills that it takes to to basically be in a high functioning team. You know, I'll just add that, you know, unlike when I was in school, I don't think most skills were teaching soft skills. But, you know, a good friend of mine, you may know her, Deb Hempel-Medina, you know, we used to work together in S.V. Dallas and she actually started a class at Austin where she was teaching just these very skills. I was also kind of a bit jealous of her because she was, you know, teaching a class that I would have loved to have taught. I actually went down there and guest taught for her a couple of times as a guest speaker. But, you know, that's how important I think these skills are. I developed a class for it. And I, you know, again, I just think they're really important. And when you received that constructive feedback that you were not a good writer or speaker, how did you address that gap? How did you deal with that constructive criticism? You know, at the time, I'm sure I probably just blew it off and said, OK, whatever. But and, you know, so I don't know that I ever really set out to address it. But I can tell you that, you know, through my involvement, particularly with S.P.E. and practice, I improved. I started writing papers and when I wrote papers and I still do this, I ask people who I respected and trusted and to review the papers and critique them. I also have served on program committees. So I've read abstracts, I've read papers, I've seen good ones, I've seen ones that needed improvement. Of course, I've made many presentations. A lot of that was just trial and error. But, you know, the key every time was practice. And that's one of the things that I always explain to people is you just really have to practice. You know, I'd say it all kind of came together when Danny Bell, who was a Dallas section chair, asked me to teach how to write S.P.E. paper class and actually talked about, you know, asked me to teach the soft skills, which again took to Deb's class as well. And, you know, I think back at how I was told I wasn't very good at that. And now I was being asked to teach a class about it. So, you know, I didn't set out, but fortunately, I was involved with S.P.E. and that helped. And how can S.P.E. members use S.P.E. to improve their soft skills? Well, you know, similar to what I did, I would say, first of all, you know, when it comes to the technical writing, I would say, you know, look for opportunities to write papers. There is a lot of training modules. You know, I've talked about the abstract writing course I have. I know Jeannie Perdue's got some great technical writing skills classes on the S.P.E. training site. So, you know, I'd look for that. I would make presentations, you know, maybe start at your local section, present a topic for them, maybe go to some, you know, get into some workshops, conferences. Obviously, if you write a paper, you'll be asked to present it. Maybe start with, you know, a regional conference, which may be not quite as intimidating as one of the more flagships. But, you know, that can help that. You know, the other thing that's interesting is I would attend your section meetings, look for ways that you can volunteer serving on committees. Obviously, you know, we've talked about this before, but if you do that, someone's going to ask you to lead something at some point. So then you have the opportunity to work on your leadership. That's the local section. I also would encourage people to get involved in the international committees. Those then you start learning not only to volunteer and lead, but you also start learning how to network and collaborate, not just with people in your region, but across the world. And then, of course, you'll build your network that way as well. And, you know, I just want to point this out. And, you know, there's been times when I've been asked to lead things and I'm thinking, I'm not really sure I'm qualified for it. But, you know, I just want to say that if somebody asks you to lead something and you're uncomfortable, that's probably a good thing. Accept it. You know, that's how you learn. That's how we get better. You know, get out of your comfort zone and think you'll be well off by by saying yes. So when you mentioned volunteering, why is volunteering so important, particularly in SBE? Well, so first of all, SBE is a volunteer organization, so it's critical for SBE to have volunteers. But, you know, moving more towards, you know, why it's important to you personally, which is, I think, the main reason a lot of people do this is, first and foremost, you know, I think your professional development. We talk about this with the gym membership, but you professionally develop your soft skills by typically volunteering. You get to network. I have personally gotten professional fulfillment out of this. You know, I leading like you're doing now, leading ATC program committee and seeing that that that come to fruition is just provides a lot of professional fulfillment. You know, those are the things that you get personally out of it. And then, of course, you know, I think we do have a bit of an obligation to give back, particularly as we get to senior level. I mean, we we've all gotten a lot out of SBE and out of our careers. And I think, you know, we can we can get give back. And what I always find is I get a lot more in return than I have you forgiving. It's it's amazing. But, you know, I also want to make sure we point out that volunteering at both the local and international level, I mentioned a little bit before, but by volunteering at that international level, you now start meeting your your network grows substantially. And, you know, I think, as we all know, building that network is very important to your career and, you know, development, your professional development. So I think that's, you know, that's the biggest reason why I think it's important. You mentioned times when you were asked to serve. How does an SBE member find volunteer opportunities? Well, first, I'd say so. Your section where you live and make sure you're affiliated with that on your membership and, you know, attend meetings as often as you can. You'll find there will be opportunities there to volunteer and to help. I would recommend joining at least one technical section. Maybe it's in your field of expertise. Maybe it's something you want to learn. You can, you know, usually there's going to be things that those technical sections are doing that you can find ways to volunteer. You know, on the international level, you know, frankly, go into your SBE profile and you can select that you want to be notified of any kind of volunteer opportunities. And you will then get notifications from SBE whenever there's a volunteer opportunity for you. And then, you know, allow, obviously make sure you read those SBE emails, but we're just respond to the ones that looks like they might be an opportunity for you. Wonderful. And in the end, this all seems to go to the heart of your gym membership analogy, doesn't it? Well, yeah, you know, I like it. But, you know, the gym membership, of course, again, when we join a gym or a health club for our physical well-being, and I think we think of SBE as our professional well-being and a lot of what we get out of SBE and what I've gotten out of SBE has been, you know, the soft skills, the leadership skills, you know, the volunteering and, you know, professional fulfillment. And, you know, if we want a healthy future, we need to make sure we take care of our health. And if we want a long and rewarding career, then we need to take care of our professional health. And I think that, you know, just like always, the more you put into it, the more you get out. I mean, ultimately, you know, this is how I think we'll we can each individually and collectively create our energy future. So what's up next for you in July? Well, let me say, first of all, Susan, before I tell us what's up next, I want to thank you for joining me today. It's been great. I know this is one of your passions. And also, I just want to thank you for everything you do for SBE. I mean, the Gulf Coast section, the board, I know you're running the ATC program committee and have helped me on a lot of the opening general session and the panels. And then, of course, you know, you do a lot of work with students and professionals. So thank you for all you do. As far as next month, you know, this I'll have about two months left in my term. We'll start to look at tying things up. I think I'm going to talk to Simon Seton, you know, the CEO of SBE. He'll be, you know, about three fourths of the way almost through his first year. And we'll talk about maybe talk a bit more about the member survey, you know, what we learned from that, maybe where we're headed, how that fits into the strategic plan. I also want to talk about something that's near and dear to you, and that is ATC 2024. Some of the cool changes we've got in store for that to help us celebrate the 100th anniversary. And then maybe we'll just touch on a few other outstanding member benefits that we haven't covered yet. But but I think that's what we're going to do. So hopefully everybody tunes in next time. And again, thank you, Susan, for for joining me today. Thanks for the opportunity. Take care. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the SBE President's Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish.

Startups in O&G with Barbara Burger,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Gaia Talk, Biodiversity, Perspectives on Current Issues and Challenges. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on April 17th, 2024. And now your moderator, David Shackleton. Welcome to this SPE Live Gaia Talk, Biodiversity, Perspectives on Current Issues and Challenges. My name is David Shackleton and I'm the chairperson of the SPE Methane Emissions Management Technical Section and chair of the Sustainable Development Technical Section Gaia Study Group. I'll be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. I also encourage you to join the SPE Gaia Sustainability Program using the QR code on the screen here. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest, John Finistore. He's the principal consultant of Biodiversity, Water and Nature at ERM, where he helps organizations maximize the returns from natural capital through strategic action on finance, biodiversity, ecosystem services, water, nature-based solutions and supply chains. John is an expert in natural capital accounting, valuation, science-based targets for nature, and the task force on nature-related financial disclosures, TNFD. Previously, John led the World Resources Institute Business and Ecosystem Services Project. He's authored numerous publications, most recently, Time to Take Stock, along with serving on leadership groups including SBTN Corporate Engagement Program and the TNFD Forum. He's conducted over 100 natural capital assessments and accounting efforts for governments and corporations. John, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you. Good to be here. Great. So let's start with some questions. We're here to talk about nature and biodiversity. To set the context of this, the economy and the companies that we work with, just how important is nature in terms of the global economy, say, gross domestic product? And what are the risks to the economy as we continue to push through Earth's planetary boundaries? Yeah, it's a very topical question. So yeah, I think there really has been a shift probably in the last five or 10 years or so away from sort of a conservation mindset where biodiversity was all about protecting places and having areas that were set aside away from nature. And that's really shifted. And as part of that shift, there's really a recognition that the global economy depends on biodiversity, depends on water, depends on clean water, depends on soil for food, for timber, clean air, just for basic livelihoods. And there have been some studies out there. One estimates that 50 percent of corporate wealth is moderately or heavily dependent on nature. You see that a lot of the primary industries like agriculture and forestry, others have sort of calculated that there's $24 trillion in GDP that has a direct connection to biodiversity. Others look at some $10 trillion in economic opportunity for trying to solve some of the problems we have in there being kind of less nature and more economic growth as a result. So you could probably poke some holes in some of those studies that the methods aren't the most robust. But I think they do point to a real dependency there. And for any organization or any company, it's going to depend on what those risks are and where those risks are. And, Anne, you mentioned there are some risks out there. And yeah, they're generally very, very localized. So I think you will see some some places we've seen ecosystems collapse. We've seen that in some fisheries. The dust bowl here in the States was an example of ecological collapse. And we're certainly there are studies sort of charting that too as well. And those those present themselves both in a lack of access to direct direct supplies. If you do depend on things directly from from nature, water is certainly one of them. We're seeing we're seeing water shortages throughout throughout the world and even here in the states that that are cause for concern. And on top of that, I think there is just a general just like with climate, there is a general existential risk out there. If you're not due to all companies, because if we do begin to see these ecosystem collapses in combination with with climate collapse, it is it is a real serious concern and we can't solve our climate crisis without also solving the nature crisis that you are intimately linked. Yeah, this is serious. I'd like to talk a bit about the global biodiversity framework that was recently signed at COP 15. Could you tell us what what led up to this? What was happening in the sustainable development community that led to the framework being adopted? Yeah, I guess it was a lot going on. I mean, first, I guess there were just just in terms of numbers, the sheer sheer volume of data about ecosystem collapse or near collapse was coming. We've we've crossed one point seven, one point almost one point two degrees Celsius increase since pre-industrial times. We've seen only three percent of ecosystems remain intact globally. You know, two thirds of all reef sharks and rays are at risk. Ninety percent of all seagrass has been lost. And there's really been a reaction to that. And I guess a couple of things worth pointing to, one is some work of the Potsdam Institute in planetary boundaries. What they did was charted sort of nine global systems climate among them, biodiversity, freshwater that we depend upon for economic growth and for prosperity. And we've crossed, we've been charting that over the last last decade or so. And nine and six of those nine have effectively been crossed now. We'll be on the point where we can sustain nature. And we're seeing that we're seeing that in in some of the impacts of climate change. We're seeing that in dead zones around the bodies of water where nutrients are causing algal blooms. So that's that's one thing on the science side. There was also a movement led by the late E.O. Wilson, the botanist, who basically had this vision of half Earth effectively. He tried to measure what will it take to how much of the world needs to be set aside just for ecosystems to maintain ecological integrity. And his calculations were that about half of all the ecosystems need to be left for nature and nature alone. It doesn't mean there's a line and half the world is a city and half the world is nature, but rather more of an integrated mosaic. On top of that, there's been movement to kind of drive these these these planetary boundaries to specific targets. So corporations right now have a target for for climate zero by 2050 or thereabouts. And they're working basically to develop those same targets now for these these other parts of the planetary systems. And we're seeing that as a group called Science Based Targets for Nature that's beginning to to develop and roll those out. On top of that, there's really been a swell, including from business leadership leading up to the conference of parties or COP 15, where this agreement was signed. A group called Business for Nature involved companies like Unilever, the HM Group, Rabobank, Yara and others who basically advocated for a strong biodiversity framework. I think it's a combination of things that led to the success at the conference of parties. OK, so can you tell us exactly what that framework is that was brought in at the COP 15? While you're at it, what is COP 15? Because not to be confused with COP 28, I thought we just had COP 28. So if you can explain that to you. Right. Yeah. So the first conference of parties for the on the biodiversity side effectively was the foundation of the Convention on Biological Diversity that effectively manages it. It's sort of the IPCC for biodiversity that was formed in Rio in 1992. It's when the Brutland Commission was formed and sustainable development sort of became part of the popular vernacular. And that's more or less a convention amongst countries. Basically, most of the world's countries, the US being one of the big, big holdouts, is not a member of the, rather most of the world's nations, except the US, are members of the Convention on Biological Diversity. And every five or so years, they roll out a new framework, a new set of goals for nations around the world to achieve. And effectively in December of last year, the Global Biodiversity Framework was that it was basically two years of negotiation amongst all the different parties leading up to that point. The US was in and out of those conversations, very involved at the end, though. And effectively what it's a pretty complex document that lays a lot of different goals out, but the ones that I think are most relevant to the corporate world are three. One is a target to return 30% of all ecosystems to nature by 2030. So the 30 by 30 goal is what was laid out, and that's sort of a parallel to the zero by 2050 goal that we're seeing on the climate side. Secondly is corporate reporting requirements. So the Convention basically called for all, called for countries to develop requirements for companies to report on their biodiversity risks and opportunities. The EU has launched their CSRD, or Convention on Basically, the Sustainable Reporting Convention that basically requires companies to report on these things. And we're seeing countries around the world beginning to do that as well. And the third point is really a call for companies to be nature positive. And the specific, the technical definition of nature positive is still being refined. But effectively what we're talking about is an end, one and end to the destruction of biodiversity, the loss of ecosystems that are maintained, and then a return or some sort of an improvement. And it's part of that 30 by 30 goal. And that's one of the things I guess we're working on now is refining that and integrating that definition in with some of the targets work that I mentioned earlier, those thresholds and taking points. So is this affecting all businesses or just the larger companies? How are these regulations generally being? Yeah, that's a really, really good question. I would say I think all businesses are going to be affected to some degree. One, because there are some costs associated with that. Just like with climate and dealing with water issues, there are changes in business practices that are out there. There are also opportunities in there, I would argue. But I would say that the companies that are most affected in the short term are going to be those that are primary industries. So those folks in agriculture and forestry and fisheries. Because there is going to be increasingly more requirements for more transparency and better performance over time. For example, ending deforestation for agriculture, for land clearing, for agricultural systems. We also should expect to see calls for greater performance in the agricultural and other primary industries. So using some less damaging techniques. For example, just the thousands of tons of soil that wash through the Mississippi every year. Can we maintain those on farms and what kind of systems can be put in place? At the same time, there are just general reporting requirements for companies to look at these risks and opportunities, both in their operations, but also in their supply chains. And that's one of the things that the EU directive gets at is requiring companies to do that. So we're going to be seeing these kinds of reporting requirements grow. And our experience is my experience has been that when companies begin to take a look at what these risks or opportunities actually find things that are material, that do matter financially to the company. So I think we should expect this to be a bigger part of corporations. And the last thing I'll maintain is just large landholders. This 30 by 30 goal basically means there's going to be more interest from the public sector in securing land for conservation purposes, which means the value of some of these lands should go up. Interesting. Thinking about reporting, part of the sustainable development technical section, GAIA program is measuring what matters. And I've been involved with that a bit. And we look at in terms of sustainability, what needs measuring, what really matters. And, yeah, biodiversity has definitely come up and it's very challenging. I see that. So in terms of data, how is this handled? I know there's some standards that are out there, but how should companies be starting to think about data and get the reporting? Yeah, that's a good question. There's a slide that I could, if you could put the first slide up and maybe sort of a view of kind of the global architecture is useful. Complex slide, I know, but if you just take the left hand side there where it says Paris Agreement, and this was, you know, again, signed a few years ago on the climate side. And part of that was the development of the task force on climate related financial disclosures, trying to standardize those financial disclosures to the investment community. And there was a target setting component to that. And that's basically bled down. It's bled down to international standards and reporting requirements and now even into laws. And obviously there's some corporations that were leapfrogging that whole process and trying to get ahead of it. So I think this is the process that's going on, which is driving some of the data requirements. If you go to the right hand side of this, you're looking at some of the global biodiversity framework, and it is driving the task force on nature related financial disclosures. Again, I mentioned the science based targets for nature. This is the target setting side and there are some various standards on how biodiversity data should be collected and measured. And those are becoming more unified. I've been in this space for over 20 years and I've never seen so much coordination and cooperation amongst these different groups before. So we're really seeing a movement in that and that's already affecting some of these standards. GRI has a new standard out there. And we're even seeing discussions in countries around the world about some of these reporting requirements. I mentioned the European Union, but the SEC has had hearings about this. The UK government is having hearing about this. Having hearing about this. Canada and even China are discussing about, you know, do we make these reporting requirements mandatory? That's one issue that I think is driving data and what data should be is needed. And I again go back to the Global Accounting Alliance and this is one of those target setting bodies that's out there as well. And I think what's really needed is a need to kind of differentiate between, rather measure impact, but also measure change over time. And there are three things that I look to, to what you need to do that. One is you need data that's comparable. So if you have a multitude of sites, you want to know which one of those sites has the biggest impacts and maybe the biggest risk to your company. You need data that can be audited. There are, for example, there are companies out there that have green bonds that are effectively the returns on those bonds are dependent upon certain environmental performance. And we want that data to be at least as good as the financial data. So we need data that is effectively auditable, either internally or if you have companies within that space, you have some external audits associated with it. And then the thirdly is you want data that you can consolidate, just like you can consolidate financial statements from different business units. You want to be able to do that for your different plants on an environmental side. So comparable, auditable, and they can be consolidated. And that to me really comes down to this idea of having a measurement called the quality hectare. It's also called a condition adjusted hectare. One more slide, I think we'll slip to the next slide there. This is an example of one company that's done that. And the way you measure the condition adjusted hectare, we'll just slip to the next slide, is basically it's a function of the extent of an ecosystem times its condition. So what's the square area of that ecosystem? Your forest, your wetland, your savanna. And then secondly, what's the measure of quality and the different different measures for quality? Basically a function of those two and you get a condition adjusted hectare. So if you have 100 hectares, for example, of a pristine forest, you have 100 quality hectares or condition adjusted hectares. If at the grade 50 percent, you have 100 hectares times point five, or you have 50 condition adjusted hectares. And what that allows you to do is basically have these consolidated data sets. And this is one company that's done that. And you can see both. You can see all their sites on the right with the detail associated with it. And on the left, you can see sort of the consolidated scores. And these can be used, obviously, for target study, they can be used for reporting and they can be used for risk analysis. So I think this is the direction that that we're going. And if you look into TNFD, if you look into CSRD, they all mentioned these kinds of metrics as as recommended. So you mentioned nothing that this is becoming the responsibility of board members in a similar way to financial accounting. Is that the case, given that there may be legal challenges to these regulations coming in? Is it still the responsibility of the board to look into these risks? Yeah, it certainly is. And that's something that's well, I should say that's that's the direction that the legal profession is going. And I'm no legal scholar, but there are a number of papers that are coming out in the popular press, in the popular field. There's certainly been a historical record in there in the academic literature, but more and more there's talk of effectively with the targets that are coming out, with the increasing data that's coming out, the the ability for a company to have a foreseeable understanding of what their responsibility is and foreseeable being the opportune word in the legal context is growing. So I would expect globally that to generally rise in prominence and board members to be required to do this. Obviously going to be a lot of legal challenges. There are some ongoing to the SEC regulations on climate that have come out. I think the EU has some regulations that they have recently put out on zero importing zero deforestation of commodities that is being challenged. But I think this is certainly growing and there are requirements in the law in law right now, especially in Europe, to to report on these things. I think this is going to become a board level decision. And again, I go back to the the ability to consolidate, compare and audit that data is going to be crucial and what board members are going to be asking for. Given the US isn't signed up for the Convention on Biological Diversity, is it is it going to come? Will the framework affect the US? I think it will. It's true. The US isn't a isn't a signatory isn't, you know, however, it has been over time. It has been generally implementing a lot of the conventions mandates. And and and requests and requirements. So it is moving in that direction. And and just because so many other countries from from Belgium to Botswana are looking at these these regulations and pushing them as well. I think we can expect that that any any company doing international businesses is going to be affected by these these these regulations. That's how I would look at it. It's a good time to get ahead. Right. So in terms of going back to data a little bit, you know, where should companies be starting with this? Knowing that it's costly, gathering good data, you know, how how is technology helping with this? Yeah, the technology is is coming along. I think we've seen in the last few years, we've seen some low land satellites being deployed right now. You can actually move satellites pretty much anywhere in the world that you want and and and get resolutions down to the the inch or or even centimeter. So I think that's a good time to get ahead. We're seeing new we're seeing, you know, deployable camera traps, other drone material, we're seeing acoustic sensors, we're seeing environmental DNA. So you can actually take scoops of water and scoops of soil and quickly process that and determine what species are in the area. So I think the the the ability to actually get that data out there and get that data out there is really important. So I think the the the ability to know what's going on is is going to get cheaper and easier over time. So I and it's it's almost difficult. It's almost impossible to follow all that technology and where it's going. But I think I think the place to start is is is either one with the some of the big data sets that are out there that that basically do provide a lot of information. They do provide some some coarse level data on ecosystem intactness or endangered species. And you can identify those very, very quickly just by entering up in some of your data. Even some of the non-governmental organizations have developed some tools to help help advance that. And the last thing I would point to is is if you are a landholder, one of the best places to start is with developing effectively a registry of assets of your of your natural assets. So what what land you hold, what different ecosystem types are on that land, what's the extent, what's the size of each of them, and then look for a condition measure for them. And they they range from the very simplistic you can you can get and pull off off the web and get some get to get a course reading to the more complex where you're doing some site level data. And that just depends upon the risks. I think I think it's a quick level scan to see if you have some risks. But then once you if you are a landholder, really begin to build those registers of assets and know what you're holding. So let's let's think about our audience here and get a bit more specific into oil and gas and how it affects the companies that probably a lot of our audience are working with. We've got a question actually from from the audience from Flora Moon. Thank you for joining us, Flora. I'll just read this one out. How has the oil and gas industry responded to the biodiversity framework, if at all? I probably am not the best person to speak to this sector as a whole. I do know that various working groups have been researching and trying to get come to terms with what it means. And I think that this is a trend. And it's just the beginning of a trend. And maybe the reporting requirements aren't necessarily the end of that. And I think in thinking, you know, thinking long term about what's the kind of data I'm going to be able to get to. And I think that's a good question. And I think that's a good question. And I think that's a good question. And I think that's a good question. And maybe the reporting requirements aren't necessarily the end of that. And I think in thinking, you know, thinking long term about what's the kind of data I'm going to need to really demonstrate the positive impact that I'm having on the ground and as well as responding to any risks. So I think I think we're starting to see a pretty robust response, but a careful response. And I think that's the right way to go. I think we're going to know for another year or two kind of where all the different standards are going to end. TNFD, for example, has another five and a half years of funding left over and they are continuing to try and refine what these metrics should be and how how companies should be responding. So I would say that there's definitely a lot of internal thinking and planning going on. And I would expect to see CSRD, that's the European regulation and TNFD reporting on, you know, by the oil and gas industry starting next year, if not the year after. Okay. So we don't have any other questions that are coming in from the audience right now. So if I could just lead you to a close and get your final thoughts on these current issues and challenges associated with biodiversity. Before we wrap up, please. Yeah, I guess it's it's it is biodiversity is one of the most complex topics, I think, that's out there. And it's hard to to really define that complexity. But it is one that can be addressed in steps. And I would just encourage anyone to begin the process is to begin to start to take a look at, you know, where do I have where are my assets? And what kinds of biodiversity resides on them? I think that that is a step and I would encourage everyone just to get started. And see where the opportunities are right. Any tips for for engineers you may know in the industry, if you can imagine, you know, the audience, what can they do? What are these practical steps as they look around? Yeah, I think I think first and foremost, it's it's again, the registry of assets is a is a great place to to start there in terms of practical tips out in the field. I think the first thing I understand, I think, is is really is is understanding that it's going to be dynamic and that what you do today isn't necessarily what we're going to be doing in five years just because technology is rolling so quickly. So I would encourage a flexible method. And again, I mentioned this quality hectare method where you're looking at both the extent and the condition, the measure of that condition is what's going to be adaptable. But that overall framework for measurement won't. So most oil and gas companies that I've come across to have some extensive site based data, but it hasn't necessarily been digitized in throughout the organization. I think that's that's an important first step is beginning to get that data organized and that again, that condition extent framework provides a way to do that. What's what's good about the what I like about the the quality hectare method is it also gives you a way to begin to complement any data gaps you have with some public data sets and then to build those up over time. And again, the biodiversity and tactus index ecosystem and tactus index, even the mean species abundance are just a few that come to mind. They're effectively global data sets that are available to give you a relatively good measurement of of ecosystem health and ecosystem condition. So that's that's effectively where I would I would encourage companies to start. Fantastic. Thank you so much, John. Thank you so much for your time with us and sharing your knowledge and experience. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks to the S.P.E. and thank you to the audience for joining us today. Really appreciate that.

Drillbotics with Fred Florence and Enrique Losoya,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the July 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future, enhancing member value. And now your moderator, SPE CEO, Simon Seaton. Hello, I'm Simon Seaton, SPE CEO. And I am pleased to join the 2024 SPE President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast episode. Thanks, Terry, for the invitation. Well, thank you, Simon. Thanks for joining. You know, when I started these monthly podcasts, the beginning of my term, you know, the primary goal was to help members create their energy future by understanding how to get the most out of their SP membership. And, you know, we'll probably talk a little bit about that during the membership survey discussion today. But, you know, I've tried to key on the many programs and offerings that we can access as members. And so at this point in time, I think we've largely covered most of it. I think we'll talk a bit about awards today we hadn't talked to. But otherwise, I think we've talked about the primary things SP has to offer to its members. And so this month, I thought, you know, it might be good to look at more closely at ATCE 2024 in New Orleans, our 100th anniversary, as well as, you know, our recently completed member survey. And, you know, given the input that you had on this, I thought what better person to discuss this than with you. You know, I think, you know, you're our CEO, you brought some really unique fresh perspectives to the to not only the role of CEO as a kind of a regular SP member, I'll call it regular. But also, you know, I think that you brought a really good perspective to the annual member survey, given some of your experience in the past. And, you know, you you expanded that survey this year to include a more comprehensive look at what drives member value. Thanks, Terry. Yeah. When I got here, I did feel that the survey format SP was using was a little dated. And even some of the measurements we use like Net Promoter Score are really no longer considered the best in class metrics. As it happened, the SP communications team were already looking at alternatives, and I was happy to share with them recent experiences I had had focusing on measuring the value that we bring rather than necessarily the satisfaction levels. So the methodology fit well with the work that been done prior to the pandemic on member value and also aligns really well with the first objective in our strategic plan, which is increased awareness of SP's membership value proposition for current and potential members. But before we get started on that, I know you continue to be really busy with your travels. What have you been up to in the last month? Well, you know, we had a big trip after our board meeting in Perth, you know, Justin Kejim and I out of the KAL office. We spent a week in India really just trying to reacquaint ourselves with the sections and chapters in three major cities, Bangalore, New Delhi and Mumbai. Met a lot of passionate professional and student members. And, you know, I think given the expansion of energy and the needs in India, I think it's really exciting to continue to our support in that region. You know, and I see a lot of opportunities for SP but also for our members there. I also went to OTC Houston, along one of our oldest running flagship events, of course, over 30,000 attendees again this year, which, you know, again, this is a collaboration with over 20 other societies and organizations. So it's a big event and a big undertaking to put this on. You know, from what I saw year over year, I felt like it was the panels and the technical sessions were really well attended. I felt like the show floor, even though we're probably flat on attendees, I thought the show floor had more buzz. I had a lot of people saying, you know, we need to think about being here next year from an exhibition standpoint. And, you know, the nice thing about this event is it's really continued to transform. You know, it truly runs a gamut of offshore technologies, you know, everything from classic deep water, oil and gas development to offshore wind and alternative energies. And, you know, I think it just showed how our industry is leading the charge in addressing the global energy challenge of meeting, you know, growing demand of affordable, reliable and green and decarbonized energy. I also went to Midland. That was, it's always fun to go out in Midland and meet our section members there. Went to the Northwest, North American Regional Awards banquet. I was able to give a keynote address there. I really appreciated the invitation, met the Permian section members. But, you know, they basically handed out 40 scholarships, totaling over $140,000. And I think we sometimes forget, we talked about this one in my earlier podcast, we forget about the dedication that we have towards members in the next generation. And you can't do that without our volunteers, but also we can't do that without the tremendous support of our local companies and sponsors. So that was really fun. And then I, you know, I also traveled to Brazil, where I met with some of the local sections and chapters there. They're doing some just amazing things in Brazil. The Brazil section, the Mackay section. I also attended my first CCUS event. This is an event that's run in collaboration between SPA, APG and SCG. This event has typically been held in Houston for the last three years and had over 1,700 member of attendees this past spring. So this was the first one run outside. We had over 400 attendees talking about the latest in carbon capture and storage. So, you know, again, I think it highlights our industry's importance to this critical technology. And it's just another one of the successful collaborations with our sister societies, APG and SCG. So, you know, we put on other events like ERTEC, IPTC, and I think this is now becoming one of the, you know, it's starting to approach that type of event with the CCUS event. That's great. And it's clear whether we continue to get a high percentage of our energy from oil and gas, or we transition and expand, add new energy sources. The skill set of petroleum engineers and all those other technical disciplines involved in oil and gas will be needed for a long time. And so will those scholarships. So thanks for that. You mentioned one of our long running flagship SPE events, OTC. Let's talk about another one, SPE ATCE 2024 in New Orleans. Yeah, so ATCE is our longest running flagship event. This year will mark the 100th anniversary. I think most people know that. You know, what's interesting is ATCE even predates SPE when SPE was a division that the petroleum division under AIME when we held our first annual conference. That was in 1924. You know, I would say since that time and certainly for most of my career, ATCE has been known as the event to attend. It has been the event to present a paper, the event exhibit and sponsor. It's our annual meeting of members. We have many member events going on. I mean, I could, it's too numerous to list, but some of the key ones are Petro Bowl, the student competition, you know, we have our awards banquet, international events, banquet, you know, universities have alumni functions. There's all kinds of other meeting, member meetings. But, you know, over the last few years, particularly, I think going into the pandemic and then I think the pandemic really solidified it. We recognize that ATCE and maybe even one or two other flagship events really needed some reimagination, you know, to ensure that we still continue to be able to hold our first annual conference. To ensure that we still continue to stay on the edge of meeting our members' expectations, you know, and making sure we deliver value to our sponsors and our exhibitors. So, you know, last year, Michelle Boyd's SP and staff began working along with the board, particularly, you know, Karen Olson's TC committee on reimagining ATCE. They even employed a third party consultant. They interviewed many members, interviewed ATC attendees, some past, some present, some that don't attend anymore, some of our exhibitors. And, you know, they really came out with some several high level findings. First of all, you know, it continues to be strong on technical content. The abstract submissions are still high. It provides a high level of networking and most people who do attend look forward to reconnecting with their colleagues. But I think the common theme is that the event kind of has become a little bit tired. Maybe it lacks a little bit of buzz. The foot traffic has declined for exhibitors and so they, you know, beginning to question the value. So, you know, and, you know, partly because we expanded so much, the convention layout may not have been real conducive to networking. You know, it's kind of spread out a little bit. But, you know, the other thing is there's just tremendous competition. Not just of our own events, but even some external ones. To some extent, we might have become a little bit of victims of our own success in events like IPTC and HFTC. So, you know, these are the learnings. And so what we've done and, you know, I commend the board and particularly Michelle and her team for planning some really exciting things for 2024 in New Orleans. The theme of the event is Powering the Future with a Century of Innovation, really to kind of lean into that 100th anniversary and how we're going to move forward. We still have a strong technical program. We had almost 2,000 abstracts again. There'll be 50 paper and e-poster sessions. So we'll have that. We also have, you know, almost 15 special sessions. These special sessions this year were coordinated by the technical directors in the technical sections to really bring some high level content. It's also going to include two technical special sessions. They're going to highlight the best of. So the best of the Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Conference in February and the best of the drilling conference in March. So there'll be encore presentations. And, you know, depending on how this goes and the feedback we get, we may expand this in the future. You know, one of the other big things we did, and I'm really excited that based on the member feedback and really some of our other successful flagship advances, we've expanded our executive advisory committee for ATC to bring not only a fantastic opening general session. So our opening general session will be leaning into celebrating our past and powering our future. And it's going to highlight an all-star CEO panel. We're going to have Tybal Hashemi from AdNoc Offshore, John Lindsay from H&P, Jeff Miller from Halliburton, and Meg O'Neill from Woodside. And, you know, they're going to provide a tremendous opening general session. But in addition to that, the committee has put together six additional strategic panels. And these will be a little over one hour panels that will be spaced out throughout the three days where we're going to have some high level speakers from a wide range and a wide array of leading companies. And they're all going to be engaging in thought leadership on some very timely topics. And I'm not going to tell you what those topics are. I'm just going to tell you to go to the ATC.org website and find out more details because I think you'll be really pleased to see what else is planned. I'm also, of course, equally excited that our keynote speaker for the chairperson's luncheon on Monday is none other than Liberty Energy CEO. He's always a dynamic speaker, always has a great message. So that'll be fun. And then, you know, we've kind of heeded some of the advice, you know, the conventional layout, you know, the student paper contest, Petra Bowl, some of the special sessions are all going to be located next to the exhibit hall. So that'll make those events more accessible, but also will give us great atmosphere for the exhibition floor. And then, of course, speaking of exhibitors, again, we heard your suggestions. You know, we have additional exciting things planned. First of all, we're going to have a special ribbon cutting to open the exhibition on the show floor. We'll have some jazz music, some beignets. That'll lead into the meeting Monday evening reception. So having a reception on the exhibition floor with local food and entertainment. As I alluded to before, you know, our e-posters, our future talent zone, energy for me, they're all going to be located on the show floor itself. And the strategic panels that I mentioned earlier will be located next to the in close proximity to the exhibition hall. So that'll be good. And then one of the things that I'm really excited that we're going to try this year for ATC is if you're an SP member, you will gain free admission to the exhibition. If you want to attend the technical sessions and the papers, you'll need to, of course, register as a full delegate. But if you don't want to attend those, but you just want to go to the exhibition, if you're an SP member, you get to attend that for free. So I think I'm really excited about that to pull from the local New Orleans community. So, you know, I just want to say mark your calendars. You know, I think, you know, whether you're coming to see some of the top SP papers or technical content or learning about the latest trends in our industry from high level speakers, or maybe you're just trying to see what the cutting edge technologies is by our exhibitors or come to network, I think there'll be something there for you. And I think you'll be really pleased that you attended. And of course, it is New Orleans. So it should be a great event. Thanks, Terry. That is that sounds like it's going to be a great event. Talking about awards, let's let's let's explore that a bit more. Let's talk more. What are SP awards? And one of the cool programs that SP puts together is the awards program. You know, I think that it's imperative that, you know, we recognize the distinguished achievements of our members. And, you know, these are achievements, not only technical and professional fields, but also for their service to SP and to the larger community. There's three levels of awards. There's international and regional awards, which are kind of linked and intersection level award. So if we start with the section level, most of those sections recognize their local volunteers or local companies, sponsors, things like that. They do that in their own way. We do provide them support for that, but it's really kind of up to them on how to do that. They also may take the opportunity, like they did in the permanent section, to recognize students and give out scholarships. I would say that not only do the regional sections do this, but the technical sections, many of them do this as well. I know some give out scholarships and things. And so this all happens at kind of the local level. Moving then to the regional international awards, those two are tied together. You know, the goal of these awards is to recognize several things. First of all, our members technical contributions, their service to their colleagues, professional excellence, industry leadership. And then, of course, career, chief service. And it starts with the regional awards. The regional awards, of course, recognize the high the region winners. And what's interesting is that then the regional award winners then move on to compete for the same board at the international level. So, for example, if you win the completions, optimization, technology award for the mid continent region, let's say, then you move on to the international event as well. And so in the international level, though, in addition to these, what I'll call discipline awards. So the ones for the technical disciplines, there are an additional 10, what we call major awards. And these recognize an even higher level of achievement. Many of them are named for long standing experts in various areas of expertise, as well as, of course, we recognize distinguished and honorary membership, which is some of the highest level of honor that you can get in S.P.E. I would add that we're happy always that AIME sponsors five of these awards as well. So I would just say this is something that's really important. I think nothing is better than being acknowledged by your coworkers. And so I encourage you to look for just after ATCE in September, the portal open for nominations for next year. The regional award winners will be then recognized in the regions in the spring. And then the international award winners will be celebrated at the annual awards banquet. Of course, this year it will be in New Orleans. Next year will be in Dallas. So be on the lookout for that. Thanks, Terry. I had the great pleasure to attend the Africa Regional Awards in Ghana last week and with Africa Regional Director OG. And it was a fantastic event. Look, I'm also very excited about ATCE this year and particularly the feedback that we've received from sponsors and exhibitors to make sure we get the attendees to spend time on the exhibition floor. So I think the changes we've made to the layout and the flow of the event are going to really help with that. Going back to the member survey feedback, perhaps you can give us some background on why we do the survey and the goals this year. Yeah, so look, SP conducts a member survey each year, look for at least as long as I remember. And the bottom line is, look, we're a member society and the purpose is to support our members. You know, of course, our mission is to connect and, you know, surveys taken each year to just see how we're doing. It tends, you know, we can be used to inform our decisions. I will say the past surveys were a random sample. So we use random sampling techniques in each region. We're typically targeting about a thousand fifteen hundred survey respondents. But the one thing you kind of alluded to earlier was that our past surveys were more of what one might call a satisfaction survey. How satisfied are you with some things? But really, other than telling us if members are liked or dislike the program, it just didn't provide much guidance on to what draws our members to SP or really what drives their value of SP. So ultimately, we need the feedback so that we can form our strategic objectives at the board and executive staff level. So what changes were made this year to the survey? Well, one big change was this year, the survey was sent out to all hundred and twenty seven thousand plus members, including also some former members who have not renewed recently. So this one wasn't just a random sampling, you know, to improve the content. As you know, if you filled out the survey, the questions were way more comprehensive, depending on how you answered some questions that dove much deeper into program awareness, program effectiveness, you know, and then what value to you. And of course, while it meant for a very lengthy survey, particularly if you were involved and knew of a lot of different programming, it yielded much more usable results. So speaking of results, what was the response we received? Well, I know you were pleased. I was pleased. We got almost ten thousand responses, much more than we had ever received in the past. Now, the other thing that's important is, you know, we want to make sure that we had adequate representation of, you know, across various demographics and regions. So we worked, I know the team worked really hard to make sure we did get representation. And I think by and large, we matched the membership profile. For example, 75 percent were professional members. Of course, we would have liked to have had a few more higher percentage of students. But the good news is we had a lot of professional member response. Ten percent of them were life members. Ten percent were YPs. That matches almost exactly our overall membership percentage. Two thirds were from outside North America. And in most cases, the regional responses, if you look at our super regions percentage of membership, it mirrored the actual split. I would say there's only one exception to that, and that was Middle East, North Africa. We only had about eight percent of the respondents from there, whereas actually 22 percent of our members are from MENA. But the good news is that even at eight percent of almost ten thousand responses, that's a statistically significant number. So overall, I think we had great member engagement in the survey, and I think it reflects overall our membership. Yeah, I agree. We had the opportunity to share those results at our recent board meeting. What were the key takeaways from the survey for you? Well, I think there was some pluses and deltas. You know, I think it is always pleasing to hear that our members have a strong commitment or deep commitment to SP. They're very passionate. I think that by and large, they appreciate the SP's offerings and programs, whether it's JPT or the things happening at their local section. And I think the members see the positive effects of our mission of knowledge sharing and connection. Interestingly enough, they also value volunteer opportunities that are inclusive and provide personal development. So I think that was an exciting thing to see. You know, I would say one thing that jumped out to me is that on average, the respondents were aware of 80 percent of our offerings. I don't know whether that's a high or low number. Of course, I'd like to see it be 100 percent. But I mean, 80 percent awareness was pretty big. But if we look at who we're aware and also using those offerings, that drops to 35 percent. And, you know, this is something I've been concerned with since I joined the board. But, you know, I think 35 percent was even lower than I had anticipated. Clearly, it means our members don't see value in the programs and some of the programs. And what I think we need to kind of understand is there could be two things going on. Is it because they understand the program very well and it's just of no value to them, which is an answer we need to understand? Or is it that they don't understand the value? And so because of that, they don't use the program. And so, you know, I think it's it goes back to one of the primary reasons that I put together these podcasts. You know, I really wanted to help our members not only understand what programs SPS offer, but also how to get the most out of those programs and ultimately their membership. So, you know, of course, each month we talk about different programs. But, you know, I think this is one of the challenges we have as leaders in the society now is to understand this and understand, you know, where we're at with each program. You know, one concern that I know you and I did have, Simon, is the energy for me. The survey basically said that our members, less than 50 percent of our members were aware of energy for me. And that was actually the largest unaware of all. And this one is particularly concerning to me because, frankly, one of the primary questions I get as I travel is what can SP do to help our image? And what can SP do to help attract the next generation? And I think this program is one of the primary ways we do that. And so it's important that we help our members be aware of this as well. The other thing that was concerned is that those that are aware of energy for me, less than a third use it. So, you know, it's just an interesting dynamic. So it's one of the things that we need to take a look at. I think energy for me is a tremendous platform. I think it has a lot of opportunities, a lot of upside potential. And so we need to make sure that we're leaning into that, but also make sure our members understand. Having said that, you know, on the flip side, while I was concerned that we saw only 35 percent awareness and usage of the people that are using a program, the satisfaction is very high, anywhere from 80 to 85 percent. So, in other words, if you are aware of a program and using it, you are very satisfied with the program itself. And that's actually a number that's pretty consistent with past year surveys of the satisfaction. So this year we learned about satisfaction, but now we also need we learned about the awareness as well. So I see that as a positive and I'm hoping that means if we can help our members understand the the programming itself, that they'll see more value and gain more value from their membership. A couple of other things that we learned, you know, the the top five and bottom five programs were very similar between professional and student members. I think that makes sense to me. I mean, by and large, I mean, there's some slight changes, but for the most part, they agree on that. And I think the last thing, let me just say that there was an index in there called the member value index. And that's a proprietary score that's put together by the consultant that we use. And for SP, it came in at 77. And that's right in the middle of other the benchmark of other societies that they look at. So I think the benchmark is 72 to 81 and we're right in the middle of that. But what's also interesting in addition to that, I mean, it means we have some room for improvement. But what's interesting is that if you look at the super regions, the score was also very consistent across all seven. So the member value index had a low of 74 in Europe and a high of 81 in Africa. And so really that range is very tight. And so it means that if we can understand that better, we have the ability to really help our members. So, you know, the survey has been shared with the members. It's been shared with the officers and sections. And of course, it's available on SP.org for anybody who wants to look at that as well. Thanks, Terry. As well as the response data, this year's survey also included an open ended question requiring a text response. What did those tell us? Well, yeah, yeah. And over almost 10,000 text responses. Thank goodness we had AI because I don't know how we would have synthesized all those responses down without it. So, you know, we didn't use AI to do that. We've mentioned some of the themes already, you know, whether it's some of the cost of the offerings and things like that. But maybe just let me just talk about a couple that we haven't mentioned. One is, you know, there's a divergent viewpoint on the evolving landscape of the oil and gas industry and really how SP should respond to that. So, you know, again, not something that we're surprised about. But again, it came out again in the survey and it's something that, you know, comes with being a global organization and serving a wide range of members. There was appreciation for SP and the hard work and support of the members. One other thing that came out was, you know, there is a positive impact of knowledge sharing and mentorship. And not only is there a positive impact there, but it's also it's it's in not just the younger professionals, but also by the seasoned professionals. And so regardless of where you're at in your career, there is a positive impact of that knowledge sharing. You know, the other thing, again, not probably terribly surprising, but kind of a theme is that there is a sentiment among members that SP is having maybe an identity identity challenge and maybe maybe to some extent, some feel that they're no longer a part of the SP club. And so, you know, that's something we need to understand and dive into. And then, of course, lastly, just a continuation of this unawareness of the member benefits and, you know, really a desire for SP to focus on communications on just their interests. There are some major challenges to be overcome in those responses, for sure, some of which I think we knew about. For me, others were a bit more of a surprise, like the concerns raised about costs by some members. So what are the next steps? Well, as you mentioned before, Simon, we the full survey results were first shared with the board and staff leadership at the spring board meeting in April. You know, I would say at that meeting, we began to kind of start to dive into the results. I mean, that's there's a lot of material there. So it took it took some time to process that. But since that time, the board members and the staff, you know, they've been discussing these results in greater detail, particularly, I'd say, through the lens of our two primary board committees. So Karen Olson and her technical content committee who are looking kind of more at the events and publications and training and other technical content. And then, of course, Simeon Ivory, whose whose member engagement committee is looking more at our member benefits and program. So that's that's kind of the first step. You know, ultimately, the board will utilize these results to make some informed decisions. You know, as we we go continue to identify and prioritize programming. Again, our goal is to support member value and, of course, help inform our strategic goals and objectives. The survey will be used as well. We our board meeting will be coming up this month and our next board meeting in the summer. And we'll be moving forward with that there. And, you know, I believe this data then will be used in most of our discussions and plans to talk about, you know, how we move forward. So, you know, I will just say that we're committed to keeping the members informed. I mean, I think hopefully you'll see some some improvements just organically, but we'll also try to to keep them informed about the progress improvements. Well, it looks like we're about to run out of time before we go. Any other final words regarding the survey? Yes. You know, Simon, I just want to thank everyone for who took the time to complete the survey in January. I know it was long. I mean, I I thought the same thing when I was going through it. It was time consuming, but I can't overestimate how important the results are to the board. You know, we just continue to look for ways to improve and provide our members with the value they have come to know and expect out of S.P.E. So thank you for doing that. You know, again, our profession is critical to meeting humanity's appetite, you know, the appetite for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. You know, and I think that by S.P.E. continuing to provide a platform for our members to connect, whether it's to technology or each other or external stakeholders, by providing top notch programming and offerings and networking events that I think ultimately we can create our energy future for our members and for S.P.E. Thanks, Terry. And finally, what's on tap for August? Well, first, Simon, let me thank you for joining me. I know you're busy. I know you're traveling is just like I am. But I do want to say it's been a lot of fun working alongside you and your staff over the past year. I think that we've learned a lot from each other. And, you know, I think that what we'll do in August, that'll be my last podcast and J.P.T. column. So I think what we're planning to do is take a little look at the S.P.E. over the last year, perhaps, you know, talk about some of the things I've learned in my travels, maybe talk a little bit about where we're headed. Of course, in preparation for Olivier to take over. And who knows, I might even have a special guest on. So again, thank you very much, Simon. And we're looking forward to talking to everybody again next month. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the S.P.E. President's Podcast, creating our energy future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org. Thank you."
SPE Talks Tech: Drilling Automation Roadmap with John de Wardt,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE LIVE! Market Outlook, Oil Prices for 2023, US Natural Gas Market, and more. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on February 22nd, 2023. And now your moderator, SPE Virtual Programs Development Manager, Natalie Femmaietti. Welcome to this SPE LIVE! on Market Outlook, Oil Prices for 2023, US Natural Gas Market, and more. My name is Natalie Femmaietti. I am the SPE Virtual Programs Development Manager, and I will be your moderator today. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Edward Hears is a leading energy economist. His work has informed US national security policy under both parties. He is a co-founder of Zero Carbon Cycle, LLC, a sustainable fuels company, and advisory director to an independent oil and gas company. He is a U.H. energy fellow at the University of Houston, where he teaches energy economics and an advisory director to the Energy Industries Council. Ed is a fourth contributor and energy expert for KHOU Television in Houston. Ed attended Yale University, receiving his BA with honors and distinction in economics, MA in economics, and MBA. Ed, welcome to this SPE LIVE! Good morning. Ed, let's start by talking about the current events happening with Russia and China. Is this affecting the oil and gas markets right now, and what it could mean for the industry in the future? Yes, so we've got a lot of short-term actions underway in having to do with the war in Ukraine. In particular, first of all, going back to this time last year, the Western nation, the allies, announced financial sanctions against Russia. And so, that began to restrict Russia's access to global oil markets, mainly because they couldn't be paid in hard currencies. Over the past year, Russia has found a way to evade that, mainly by dealing with China and India to sell them oil through the fleet of ghost tankers via pipelines. And, in fact, there was a lovely Bloomberg article today talking about how Kazakhstan is shipping its oil, which is really Russian oil, to Germany and to Western nations. So, there's been a bit of laundering, if you will. So, we've seen some decrease in Russian oil production, maybe about a half a million barrels a day, and that's primarily because the Western oil service companies have left Russia. Russia never really took the time to develop its own internal oil services industry or really technology to develop and advance their production and development. So, we've got that pressure, if you will, on the market. It's not really too terribly significant. The imposition of the Russian oil price cap, if you will, by the Western allies, some 34 nations, basically telling the Russians, we're not going to buy your oil for anything more than $60 a barrel, has been totally ineffective and really not much of an issue. With China, keep in mind that China consumes about 14 million barrels a day, and production in China really hasn't changed since 1995, when they produced about four to four and a half million barrels a day today. That domestic production for China is still about four to four and a half million barrels a day. One of the changes that we see going into all of 2023 is the ending of the releases by the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Over the past year, that has averaged almost a million barrels a day as the U.S. ran down its SPR to provide resources to the European nations who lost access to Russian crude and to help keep the world oil price down a bit. As it turns out, data show that China has been storing as much as half a million barrels a day. You could argue that the releases from the SPR in the United States have added to the Chinese strategic reserves. With this kind of background in place, we look at the oil price, which currently is about $70-odd per barrel. That's down significantly from what we saw early in the war and through some of the summer. It appears that OPEC, without regard to Russia, that OPEC is very interested in keeping the price at this level. I expect it to kind of stay at this level, give or take any kind of extreme actions that could occur. A broadening of the war in Europe or perhaps even peace breaking out, which would be certainly good for global anxiety and perhaps relieve some upward pressure on the price of oil. Thank you for your insight Ed. You mentioned OPEC and that's actually part of my second question. Let's continue with that. What do the prospects for the recession in the U.S. mean for oil commodities and how does OPEC come into play? Certainly the prospects for a recession have put a damper on economic growth. While a lot of folks in the administration and at the Federal Reserve think that we're in for a soft landing, that could be, but it's possible that we could have a recession. The higher interest rates in the United States have certainly put a damper on home prices. We've seen home prices drop 10, 15, even 20% in some of the major markets. This is where new growth, new building, new investment always occurs and the industry kind of moves up from that. It employs people, it helps with the building supply, and so this slowdown in investment in infrastructure can be a challenge for the global economy. If the United States dips into a recession, we could have some real challenges. We've seen over a couple hundred thousand layoffs in the tech industries. That's had a big impact, for example, in California. That has a downward pressure, if you will, but looking further at how OPEC is adjusting, they certainly aren't doing anything to provide new production. They announced about a two million barrel a day cut against their quotas, but that really hasn't come into play either because, well, frankly, they weren't producing at their full quotas. The data point that I've been watching with the Middle East in particular is that the rig count in the Middle East is still 20-25% below pre-pandemic levels. Never before has the rig count in the Middle East stayed down this much for this long. This goes back to what the Secretary General of OPEC said in September. He was very concerned about the lack of reinvestment in the oil patch. That lack of reinvestment, of course, is what OPEC sees in the Middle East, as well, of course, as what is seen in the United States. Ed, I would like to continue with the third question. In your opinion, what is currently the largest oil market concern? I think really it's the war. A broadening of the war that interrupts Russian deliveries of crude oil to China or India would have a ripple impact across the broader oil markets. Now, we've kind of boxed Russia in, but we're allowing this oil to go to China and India. The only effective way to really cut off the Russian ability to get hard currency for oil is to absolutely physically block the delivery of oil. We don't know who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, but that was a physical blockade, if you will, of Russia's ability to move natural gas to Germany. We haven't seen that with oil, but if those flows to China and India are interrupted, then China and India will have to go someplace else to buy that oil, and that would be a tremendous upward push on the price for oil globally. Our research and research dating back several decades shows, of course, that the price of oil is very inelastic, demand inelastic. For a 1% decrease in supply to the market, we would see a 20% to 25% increase in the price, and that relationship has held pretty well over the last two dozen years. Now, this is a very interesting, Ed. Thank you for your insights on that. Now, I really would like to move to natural gas. So, what is your forecast for the US natural gas market for this year, for 2023? Well, I don't think the price of natural gas is going to get much above $4, $4.50 per MCF. We certainly had a big spike in the natural gas price during the summer as Europe turned to US LNG companies to build up supplies to get through the winter. The price of natural gas reached $8, $9 per thousand cubic feet, and today it's somewhere around $2.50, a little bit lower, mainly due to a mild winter here and less demand, if you will, globally. The LNG producers in the United States typically buy natural gas in the spot market. They don't really buy ahead. And so, if they turn up buying, that's an added increase in demand, but we've reached the point, really dating back to September, where the domestic supply has more than caught up with demand. We have reached very significant increases from the shale plays, the Hanesvold, the Marcellus, the Utica, and we've had tremendous increases in the natural gas coming out of the associated oil plays in the Permian. At one point in the fall, the price of natural gas at Waha went negative. And so, it's really just a matter of distribution and getting natural gas to its markets. Had we had pipelines to the northeast, the folks in Boston wouldn't have been paying the LNG price of $35, $40 per MCF, but still within the confines of what is the physical market that we have for natural gas in the United States. I don't expect the price to jump much above $4.5 in MCF. This is good. Ed, I would like to move to... Let me just add that we know that the marginal cost of bringing this natural gas from these shale plays is not more than $1.50 per MCF. It's still profitable to drill and develop natural gas resources at $2.50 to $3.00. That's not an issue. Thanks for that clarification, Ed. I would like to move now to the power grid. I'm sure a lot of people from our audience, they have questions about power grid. So, what do you see as the future for the grid? And is it really a choice between renewable versus natural gas for the next generation of power plants being built? I don't think it's a choice between them. I think we're going to need both of them. In Europe, for example, we've seen a tremendous challenge as the price of natural gas jumped dramatically. Germany brought back online a bunch of coal-fired power plants to supplement their grid production. France delayed the retirement of a number of their nuclear power plants. The UK imposed one-fall profits taxes on the renewable fleet because when the price goes up for power because of an increased price of natural gas, the price also goes up for the renewable power plants. It goes up for the nuclear power plants. In the United States, we have an energy transition that is in full bloom. In Texas, we have at least 35 gigawatts of renewable energy on the grid. This is the largest nameplate capacity of any grid across the United States. But what we're facing is a situation where the legacy power plants, the nuclear, the coal, and the natural gas plants are being used less and less as we go forward. But because the renewable energy is not brought along, battery storage yet, we need the coal, the natural gas, and the nuclear to be there when we need them, when the weather is bad. To keep it by kind of, you know, to give an absolutely off-the-wall extreme example, for example, with Texas. Maximum demand in August of this past year was 80 gigawatts, and that occurred in an afternoon. So if we had to count on wind generation, the way it's currently configured, to give us that 80 gigawatts, we would need maybe as much as 400 gigawatts of wind generation nameplate capacity, mainly because the wind kind of dies down in West Texas, and we can only count on about 20 percent of it being there. Now again, this is an extremely extreme example. With a build out of solar, with a build out of transmission, we don't need to build that much wind. But this gives you an idea of the amount of overbuild that's going to be required for renewable energy. Maybe we need 250 gigawatts of wind and solar combined in terms of nameplate capacity to be able to take up the slack and do what we need to do with the, to replace gas fire plants and coal plants. The market direction is very difficult to ascertain, mainly because the leadership in Texas hasn't determined what it's going to do yet. The owners of the natural gas and coal plants are looking at the fact that they are at the end of their operating lives. The coal plants average 50 years in age, the natural gas plants average 30 years in age, and for eight of the 10 years prior to 2021, they did not earn a return on capital. Wall Street's not going to advance five years of capital for a gas plant, 10 years of capital for a gas plant, just because of one week of price gouging. And so there has to be some sort of accommodation to basically keep a parallel electricity generation infrastructure in place, and to also add the expense of building out additional transmission facilities to accommodate the location of wind and solar and bring that power to consuming regions of the state. And that's a problem that's faced Texas first, mainly because Texas economic growth has been just stupendous. The state's GDP has gone from 1.25 trillion in 2010 to 1.99 trillion in 2021. The fleet of natural gas and coal fired plants really didn't change at all. And so this sort of backbone of economic development needs to be addressed for the state to go forward. Other states are going to face this problem mainly through attrition as old plants are retired, and the regulators and governmental authorities kind of wonder how they're going to get by in future years. Thank you for that information Ed, and actually you mentioned Texas, and that's on my next question. So we can't talk about power grids without mentioning ERCOT. Has the state of Texas done anything recently to help fix the issues with the grids? No, that's a short answer. So in Texas, the ERCOT grid is what we call an electricity only grid. And so if we think about this with in terms of say a football team or a baseball team, only those players taking the field get paid. And that's the way it's been in Texas now for 20 years, only those generators actually turning electricity into the grid are getting paid. There's no payment on the side for the players on the bench, the ones that you need to come in in case of an injury or a switch hitter, a pinch hitter, or a relief pitcher. And so because Texas does the play this way, we've got a situation where say in August all of the power plants need to be operating. And we know that. If all of the power plants don't operate, then the executives of those companies have to go home to families that are very unhappy with them. But for 80% of the year, most of those plants, we only run maybe 70%. And so for those players who aren't in the game, who aren't earning a living, it's really difficult to keep them ready to go. And so the owners of these generation company of plants have just closed them down. Hello. Thank you, Ed. So in general, in summary, how do you see the oil and gas market for this year and the next 10 years? Just a summary. I know you don't have a crystal ball. Well, as an economist, I can certainly give you an answer. How accurate it'll be, we'll have to come back in 10 years and find out. So at the moment, we're going to have short-term price volatility mainly relating to the war. Going forward, we see a lot of action in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and pointing in that direction. But we also saw what happened over the summer when there was a shortage of fuel across the global network of oil consumers. And lately, we've seen BP and Shell emphasize and go back to their roots of being an oil company. They know they have to provide hydrocarbons to keep the population in the 21st century. Looking ahead, we can see about 3 billion people are going to join us on this planet, mainly due to energy development, mainly due to energy development of fossil fuels. From the fine offshore Ghana that basically exploded the entire oil and gas industry off of Western African nations. We are bringing generations of people into the 21st century. They're not all going to get afford F-150, but they all want iPhones. They all want access to the internet. This is going to be a tremendous resource of growth for the global economy and for humanity as well. I don't see demand for hydrocarbons dropping over the next 10 years. This is the easiest way to get energy to remote populations. It's much easier than stringing up power lines. The Western nations, if they're going to supplant that, need to be investing in putting nuclear power and wind and solar into these regions to basically supplement or supplant the use of natural gas and crude oil. I don't see that happening. It's an energy transition. Transitions come with cost and, of course, great benefits. As we bring these 3 billion people into the global economy, it's going to put a strain on developments, distribution, and certainly those of us in the developed world will see this in higher prices. This is a very positive comment for those in oil and gas. What about for the students that enter the industry, the oil and gas industry? Do you have any feedback for them? Should they take any other subject to be on top of what is happening? For example, you are an economics professor at the University of Houston. Should they take some of those classes? As a professor, what is your feedback or suggestion for these young professionals and students entering the industry? More than a third of my students are engineering majors. I appreciate the fact that I have a new resource, if you will, for students going forward. It's important for these students to understand the position of oil and gas in the global economy. There are substitutes for oil and gas. We are going away from coal, but coal is still a substitute. Hydroelectric is a substitute. Solar, wind, the development of consumer markets, going away from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles does not reduce the need for oil and gas, certainly in terms of natural gas fired electric generation, which can power EVs. We know that in the grand scheme of things, coal is significantly dirtier to combust, to mine, to develop, and to do away with the tailings, the ash. Natural gas is maybe just 50% as dirty, if you will, to combust as crude oil. As we go forward, we are going to see a greater shift to the use of natural gas to reduce greenhouse emissions. I see this as a dynamic time for majors in the petroleum engineering science, geology, and geophysics. This is all about how we acclimate to operating on this planet. Having a perspective of how markets work could be helpful and useful for the students and the graduates. Thank you, Ed. This is very encouraging to those young professionals and the students and for experienced professionals as well. Before we finish this SPE live, do you have any final thoughts on things happening around the world with oil and gas, with power grids, with so many things happening around the world and how that is going to affect the market? We have about three minutes before finishing, so hopefully we can get everything within those three minutes. Oh, sure. So one of the great challenges for the developed nations has been the reinvestment in infrastructure. In the United States, we have known for more than 10 years that the grid needs essentially a $2 trillion rebuild. Many of the European nations are also facing this. We have a tendency to build a highway and think that it is done. We have a tendency to string a transmission line, a local distribution company, and we think that we are done and we don't have to come back and do anything with it. But we are finding more and more over time, we have to go back and rebuild bridges. We are going to have to rebuild transmission lines and local distribution companies. As the global economy becomes more attuned to electrification, that is putting more demand on the system. Just locally, our transformer in the backyard blows up almost every 18 months without fail. It is like setting a clock. To fix that, the local distribution company in Houston, Centerpoint, is going to need to run more lines. That is expensive. Nobody really wants to pay for it because it is not something you see. So keep in mind that the value of energy is really not in what you have to pay to have it come to your house or your vehicle. The value of the energy is in what it allows you to do. It allows us to have refrigerated food. It allows us to have iPhones, computers, Zoom calls. It allows us to get to work and do things of a very high value add. Kind of thinking that, gee, $4 a gallon for gasoline is too expensive. That is not the case in Europe. Of course, we are very familiar with the way fuel prices work out to $8 or $9 a gallon. But the value that it brings and allows you to get to work. Your pay rate is certainly significantly higher than that. Thank you, Ed, for your feedback. We have one question from the audience that we can take before closing this SBE live. Do you think geothermal helps to stabilize demand or current production output in crude or natural gas? This is coming from LinkedIn. Yes, not at the moment. There needs to be a lot of investment in geothermal to make it a really significant component of our energy supply chain, if you will. There are some geothermal developments in California that have been quite successful. Of course, we all know about Iceland. I have seen some development plans for Texas, but to access that geothermal requires some deeper wells and some more expensive materials use. Nobody so far on Wall Street has stepped up with the money and the funding that is necessary to make this a significant component of our global energy equation. Wonderful. We are already in time. Ed, thank you so much for your insights. It has been great having you back here on SBE live. And to our audience, thank you for your comments, for your questions. Thank you for being here today and see you next time. Thank you, Natalie. Thank you, Ed. Thanks for listening to the SBE live podcast.

SPE Gaia Talks: Measuring What Matters,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE LIVE! A new era of production optimization. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on November 13th, 2023. And now your moderator, Case Bacon. A hearty welcome to all our viewers. It's time for SPE LIVE! again. The topic today, a new era of production optimization. My name is Case Bacon. I used to work as a production engineer for Shell for 35 years. But the last few years I've been active as an independent trainer and consultant on gas oil performance. SPE LIVE! will last 30 minutes. And please ask your questions throughout the events by typing them in on the chat box. Before starting, I would like to invite you to the SPE workshop that we're organizing in end of January in Vienna, Austria. A beautiful location. There should be plenty of snow, so you can combine with a skiing holiday if you're interested. But more important, it will be a very exciting event where experts, operators, service companies, academia will share the latest developments, innovations, successes, but also failures related to late life production topics. Not only in oil and gas assets, but we'll also address new energy applications such as CCS, geothermal, etc. So please be heartily invited to that magnificent workshop. It's my pleasure to introduce our three guests, Anthony Ellison, Akos Kis and Wouter Bothmans. I'll just do their brief introductions. Anthony is a senior artificial lift advisor for OXIE. He provides in-house support analyzing, optimizing, troubleshooting sucker rod pumps for OXIE's global operations. He's a recipient of the SPE Regional Production Operations Award, has previously served as a chair of the SPE Artificial Lift Conference exhibition in the Americas, and was an SPE Distinguished Lecturer in 2020-2021. He holds a bachelor degree in electronics engineering technology and a master's degree in petroleum engineering, both from Texas A&M University. Akos Kis works as a production technologist for OMV in Austria, Romania, Tunisia and New Zealand, where he deals, amongst others, with stimulation, sand control, produced water management, artificial lift system design and many other topics. Akos holds a petroleum engineering master's degree from the Mining University of Leoben in Austria. He's currently a board member of the SPE Vienna Basin Section and was a chairperson of that section from 2020-2022. As a recognition of his work, he was awarded in 2023 with the SPE Regional Young Professional Member Outstanding Service Award and with the SPE International The Way Ahead Energy Influencers Award. Last but not least, Wouter Bootemans is a petroleum engineer with 27 years of experience in R&D, well services, reservoir engineering, production engineering and economics. Since 2012, Wouter has worked as a freelance petroleum engineer and has carried out various projects for international clients. His main passion is the integration of disciplines to optimize performance of oil and gas wells and also apply best practices in geothermal development projects. Besides from this, Wouter has served as the SPE Chair in the Netherlands in 2012-2013. He holds a master's degree in petroleum engineering of the Mining and Petroleum Engineering Faculty at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Anthony, Akos and Wouter, welcome to the SP Live and I would now like to illuminate us on some topics. The first one is for Wouter. If you look back at how innovations and new technologies have permeated and impacted our business, can you, for one example, can you sort of comment on the historical promise that smart wells had and how it has materialized in present day, so in terms of current applications. We would love to hear you about that. Wouter, on to you. Okay, thanks, Kees, for your very good introduction. Hi, everybody. Yeah, smart wells, I think that has been the dream of production engineers and rescue engineers worldwide. What I would talk about smart wells is sensors in wells, real-time monitoring of what's going on in the well and have devices so that you can shut off or reopen certain inflow zones. And you can apply that to a single well or multilateral and mainly it's applied in horizontal wells or multilateral wells that are tied back, that have a sub-sequential tie back to a main production facility. And the overall objective is recovery optimization. So you get a lot of data and you hope that you can, with pressure, temperature and also flow rates, determine which zones do what kind of production. And that dream has, I think, matured pretty well. I think that has been a step change. It started in the mid-1990s and that has matured to a whole suite of tools and process, software packages that can iterate between produce, measure, analyze and intervene or do nothing can also be happening. So yeah, that promise in the past, my perception is that has been made pretty much true. And now you have a suite of tools available to really optimize your well-designed, your well-designed systems and your well-designed systems. But still, despite of all the tools that are available, my perception is that you always need to have the basics and the best practices. And so there was a dream for many people to develop more complex wells and reservoirs. And make them recover from those complex fields by having a continuous measurements. But you need always to have the basics and the best practices. And also what to do with the data. How much computer power do you need? What kind of decisions do you need? So you always need to have a very good thought over development plan and the strategy. You really need to know your geology. So great dream in the past, achieve those tools and systems and as a result, you can achieve a lot of things. And also technology. So great dream in the past, achieve those tools and systems and software packages and great data processing. But you always need basics and the best practices. I think the challenge is that in the future, and we are now and also ahead if you look to the future, is that can we even speed up that process of measuring, so monitoring, analyze, intervene, data storage, monitor again, analyze, intervene, so that optimization loop. And can we make it faster? And can we apply smart computers, smart algorithms on that? So and who's going to do that? So I'm really a fan of those smart wells. I like it. I think they're very good. I think the promise has been come true and still the only limitation is our own fantasy in that respect, I think. OK, thanks a lot, Wouter, for your educational, educating us on smart wells. The next topic is artificial lift. So we have a question for Anthony. I guess when people think about artificial lift, a big decision to make is between gas lifting or pumping as far as oil wells are concerned. So can you sort of take us to how that has changed, how the perspective has changed over time as experience, as innovations have kicked in, how that split between gas lift and pumping has developed? Sure. So a big shift we see in the artificial lift world and gas lift and pumping applications, if that's ESPs or if it's rod pumps, is trying to extend the operating range of these different lift methods. So if we look at gas lift, which is becoming more and more the predominant form of lift and the unconventionals in North America with the amount of gas that these wells produce, what can we do to extend the lower range that we can operate with with gas lift before we have to shift to some other lift method? Or can we extend that gas lift system for the entire economic life of the well? What can we do with things like plunger assisted gas lift to try and keep that same system and the investment that comes along with it with compressors and infrastructure to operate that? How can we make sure that we're maximizing the life of all of that equipment and the benefits we get from it for the wells? On the flip side, we see with systems such as rod pumping is trying to extend their operating range into higher and higher volumes. And in most instances, rod pumping is one of the most economic forms of lifting, if you look at it on a cost per barrel basis. And so can we move away from a more expensive, higher volume, be that an ESP system or gas lift design and move to rod pumping earlier in the wells life? So you see different advancements with the rod strings and trying to lighten that weight so we can dedicate more of the lifting work that's being done to moving fluid as opposed to lifting a big heavy rod string, larger and longer stroke pumping units to try and maximize our volume per stroke. And then, you know, what discussions do we have earlier on, you know, and the planning and the drilling and the completion stage to make sure that these wells are designed for those lift methods to succeed? The assumptions that go into a well that we expect to have on a rod pump down the road are very different than if you think it's only ever going to be on gas lift. And what we're allow for in terms of dogleg severity and deviation and things like that. Okay. Thanks a lot, Anthony. I think you highlighted a lot of critical elements of artificial lift design and operation. And I think it's certainly one of the topics that we'll take forward in Vienna. Next question is for Akos. So we've been constructing probably several million oil and gas wells in the world, drilling a lot, poking a lot of holes. And I guess people are now thinking about alternative use of those holes. Can you can you sort of shine your light on that? What potential use there is in your view? Yeah, I can remember from my side as well. And thank you for the invitation. So let me touch base on geothermal as a potential future use of existing oil and gas wells. So as you mentioned, we have many wells which are about to be P&A'd and most likely for the use of producing oil and gas from these wells are not economical. So there is a quite obvious use case of geothermal companies to have a look into these wells and then try to use them as geothermal wells. I mean, as well, if you think about geothermal companies, most of the cases are not the companies with the deep pockets. So they might have limitations on potential resources. I mean, these projects really need huge investments. So it makes sense. And then in some cases, it could really use so you could further use the well. I mean, one obvious challenge is really well integrity, because if you think about those wells have been used for maybe 20, 30, 40 years plus, so you might have issues with the casing integrity, the cementing. So, you know, bigger projects really look into drilling new wells, right? And of course, there are different ways of using geothermal energy. I mean, in some cases, you would just use the well or the rock as a heat exchanger. But if you think about classical injector and producer setup with some permabell rock in between, I mean, you can't really the chance that something goes wrong is rather limited, because most of the time you would find some formation water. So it should work. I mean, there are only three things which you need to get right. I mean, one is temperature, one is rate and the water chemistry, right? If you want to drill new wells. And then the trick is with these new wells that you cannot really transport heat for long distances, right? It's a huge difference between wind and gas. So for the geothermal wells, you really need to drill the wells close to the costumers. And then usually it makes problems with if you need to, you know, drill in the middle of the city or something. But it should always work. If you get the temperature rate and water chemistry right, it should work. The only unknown is really for which use case, because you could use the well only for heat. You could use, you know, for heat and power. And maybe if you're lucky with high temperatures, you could also use it for power generation. So there's quite some challenges out there. But as you mentioned, the geothermal industry is really sharing similar difficulties and challenges as classical and gas. And the workshop is a great opportunity to look into different use cases and different technologies. OK, thanks, Akos. It's a very exciting prospect to be able to reuse some of those fossil assets. Anthony, next one for you. I guess we're under, yeah, there's enormous attention now for being responsible operators and to really consider all the environmental aspects of our business. Can you sort of comment on how we're trying to do better in that respect and how we are doing better? Sure. So, yeah, every decision that we make and the operation of oil and gas wells has an environmental impact, has an emissions impact. So we see a big push to trying to electrify more and more of the oil and gas industry. So, you know, compressors that we might have run off of gas engines in the past, you see being moved to electrified versions, facilities and separator installations, and then we have a lot of other things that we're trying to do to make sure that we're able to do that. So, you know, compressors that we might have run off of gas engines in the past, you see being moved to electrified versions, facilities and separator installations where you had pneumatic valves that the valve actuators would have run off of well head gas. We see those shifting to electric versions or instrument air. So, you know, these are so you've got on the one hand, very large installations, you know, compressors that may have a huge impact and then valves, which on an individual basis, you know, may not have a great deal of emissions associated with them. But there are thousands and thousands and thousands of these valves spread out across all of our installations. And so each one has a small impact that that needs to be accounted for and and handled in some way. And we see a big push on minimizing flaring as much as possible or eliminating flaring entirely and in some areas. And that has operational impacts that we need to start accounting for that that maybe we haven't in the past. So if I have a facility that's down and I'm not able to flare the gas associated with that during that downtime, then what do I do with the wells that are associated with it? Can we divert that production somewhere else to some sort of storage setup for liquids that's fairly manageable, but more of a challenge on the gas side? Or do we just simply shut wells in and stop producing fluids to those facilities during these upsets, which is easier from a flaring elimination perspective. But then while these wells are down, we're not treating them with chemical. We're not treating them with corrosion inhibitor. And what is that doing to our, you know, where I get concerned, especially in my day to day job is what is that doing to our lift equipment that's down hole? And what are the potential impacts on equipment run life whenever we bring that back online? And are there more things that we can do to try and protect that equipment whenever we we have these sorts of upsets? I wasn't mentioned earlier, you know, wells that are drilled in closer proximity to populated areas. And it's, you know, that's something that comes into play whenever we are designing our our lift systems. You know, it's one thing if you're in, you know, a lot of towns in West Texas, we're used to seeing great big pumping units, you know, right outside the window and a lot of those fields, because that's what we all grew up with. And that's what has been there for 30, 40 plus years. You know, in newer developments in newer areas, that sort of surface infrastructure may not be as accepted by the community that we're that we're working with. And so then we start looking at other lift methods that have less of a surface impact on the surrounding areas. You know, ESPs, that's that's certainly easier, a much smaller surface footprint. Things like gas lift, you know, the wellhead itself, there's not a lot there that's taking up space that has an impact on the surrounding community. But the compressors, especially as we have in areas that we have more centralized gas lift, you know, they're very large, very loud installations. And so we have to be mindful of that as well as we're, you know, considering the entire lifecycle of the well and everything that has an impact on the community that we, you know, we all live and share and work in along with everyone else. So we want to make sure that we're the best stewards of that that we can be. Thanks, Anthony. Indeed, this has become a more and more important aspect of our jobs. I think we're doing we're doing our best, but there's still a long road ahead of us. Oh, yeah, we do want to encourage all our viewers and listeners to submit their questions. We'd love to hear your challenges to put in front of us. Of course, another big ticket item nowadays is digitalization, you know, sweeping across the world, across our lives, from top to toe, as you could say. Can you comment on the future role of digitalization in production management? My point of view, you know, digitalization and automated processes are really the future for all of us because then they really have the potential to increase production, reduce deferments, reduce downtime, and also to, you know, detect events and then try to act really actively and not retroactively. So I think they are really the future enables. The only thing I would always keep in mind is that all these measures, you know, need to come and need to be introduced at the right time and the right scale, because they all come at the initial with some initial investments and then later you can you can, you know, benefit from them. So, for example, we are running some really old brown fields here in our region, which are, you know, very economical. So, for example, we have many hundreds and thousands of wells with only having manual gauges on the well side. And then so there are no transmitters. And then, for example, we had now a use case when, you know, we thought about let's just install transmitters. But, you know, for this amount, it was not economical at all. And then what what, you know, always happened is that there were operators going to the well side, they would read the gauges, would make notes on some hard copy notebooks, and then they would put this into some tables and then send it to the supervisor. He would upload it into the computer. So what basically what we did is we just developed some advanced image processing as a technology, because it was mentioned it was clear that transmitter is too expensive. Having an ATT&CK certified tablet was also basically deemed to be too expensive. So what happened is now they can just use and utilize any handheld devices with a camera and then using some advanced image processing. The software actually would recognize the gauge readings and then put put the make the input directly to PIMS via this handheld device. So basically, we really reduced the amount of work for the operator. So for example, for me, this is also a use case of digitalization automation at a small scale, right? So as mentioned, I think they are great. This is really certainly mean the future of our industry, but it just needs to come at the right time at the right scale. OK, thanks, Lakos. Indeed, it is going to permeate everything we're doing, I guess, in all kinds of shapes and forms. Looking forward to that. I guess final question for Wouter. You know, as we're sort of going from fossil into new energy, I guess, I guess we're now observing we're still using wells, still lots of useful wells and for well associated technology. So what sort of comments on how you see that going in terms of technology skills, you know, service providers? Yeah, I really like that geothermal developments. I can mainly speak from the Netherlands. I've done some geothermal project investigation in Turkey and in the south of Germany, but I mainly can speak from the Dutch perspective. That's a great technique. We know about the planning process for a well to be drilled or the drilling process of the well design, the whole thinking around it. That's all work that the oil and gas has been doing since decades. And I think there's a good vis versa interaction between what we can learn from the geothermal industry and what geothermal can learn from us. And the main challenge already was mentioned for the geothermal is the money. Most of the projects are subsidized heavily. That means that they really have to look at the penny and that means that they have to do things the first time right. Now, that requires expertise, but you have to pay for that. And in that initial design, not always the right expertise is hired. You see some opportunistic companies that think, hey, that's a new business. They dive into that. They try to make some money there and then they're really on the penny. So sometimes my impression is that it's a little bit penny wise, pound foolish work. But in the Netherlands, that really significantly improved. In 2017, the Dutch Supervision of the Mines, they made a kind of alarm letter. And in 2021, they made a new overview of what is the status of that industry here. And it's much better. A lot of improvement with respect to rules and regulations, like Anthony mentioned, environmental aspects, but also the professional aspects to get things done the first time right. And yeah, I think that is where the challenge will be in the future as well. Experience people learn from the oil and gas, how they do things. It's all the same. But the other way around as well, I have to emphasize it significantly. I learned myself that because you have to be the first time right, you think things over twice. Before you do an asset job, you might consider how much asset do I actually need? I had a very nice example where an operator was recommended to use 50 cubes of HCL, 50 percent HCL. So this operator thought, oh, that's a lot of money. Why 50 cubes? Why not 60 or why not 40? So we dive into it more deeply and we came up with 20 cubes. That did the job. Cost them less than half of the recipe they earlier were recommended. So I like those things. Do the things first time right means more effort in your initial design. And there we can assist. But yeah, we know also from ourselves that it's not always having an oil and gas, not always things go right. But I'm really happy that I sometimes can support your drama projects. And that is, yeah, I think we can learn from each other. Yeah, clearly the days of wealth are not over by far. It's good to see how, you know, how sort of merging or migrating into the new era for new energy needs. I think we're, you know, time is up. We didn't have any questions from our audience. But I do hope everybody enjoyed the interaction, the questions and the information on the table. I think we'd like to close off with inviting you again to the SP workshop in Vienna end of January in the new year. Yeah, a lot of a lot of late life topics being addressed, mainly oil and gas, but also also highlighting how we slowly move into the new energy era. So I'd like to thank everybody for joining us and certainly our key guests, Anthony, Akos and Bauter for their inputs. And on that note, let me wish you a very good rest of the day, week until the year ends. Merry Christmas is a bit too far ahead, I think. But, you know, all best wishes apply. And I hope you join again for a next SP live and the next workshop. Thank you very much. The industry's digital pulse at streaming.spe.org.

Writing Abstracts with Terry Palisch,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live application of the UNFC to geothermal energy resources. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on March 29th, 2023. And now your moderator, Tim Lines. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening and welcome to this edition of SPE live. And today we're going to talk about geothermal energy resources. And just to give you some perspective, I guess some of you may be familiar with one or one or more of the many resource determination systems in the oil and gas industry. There are similar ones within the mining and metals resources sector and indeed for that matter within the wind sector and the solar sector. And what we're going to do now is explore what that looks like within the geothermal resources sector as well. Now my guest today is Joya Falcone and she is the ranking chair and the professor of energy engineering at the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom, where she leads the Energy and Sustainability Research Group and is the associate director of the Center for Sustainable Solutions. She's vice chair of the Bureau of the Expert Group on Resources Management of the United Nations Commission for Europe and chairman of its geothermal subgroup. Since 2015, she has led a group of experts developing the application of the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources to geothermal energy resources. The latest update was in 2022 and is supplemented by numerous case studies. Joya sits on the United Kingdom Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Energy Working Group. She serves on the 2022 to 2023 Board of Directors of the International Geothermal Association and indeed she is chair of that association's ad hoc committee for geothermal. She holds a L'Oreal Summa Cum Laude in environmental georesources engineering from Sapienza University of Rome, an MSc degree in petroleum engineering from Imperial College London and a PhD in chemical engineering from Imperial College London. Professor Falcone, it is a great pleasure to have you here as my guest today. Thank you very much for the introduction. It's a pleasure for me to be here today. I'd like to first ask you just a general question. Why do we need a resources assessment framework for geothermal? Well, very much for the same reasons why we have historically needed oil and gas and minerals resource assessment frameworks. That is to be able to assess the uncertainty, the investment risk and the level of confidence in a given project. And more recently the growing interest in renewable energy has clearly raised the need to homogenize the reporting for stakeholders who need to have a common comparison framework for both renewable and non-renewable energy resources. Very interesting. Well, perhaps could you describe the framework to us? Yes. So the framework is called the UNFC as you already introduced and it's a project based. So you take a project view and you enter the classification framework with the degree of confidence on the estimate of the resources that can be recovered by your project. And once you enter with a level of confidence, you then associate to it also a feasibility assessment from the point of view of the project's technical feasibility, but also economic, social and environmental viability. And what we are realizing today more and more is the importance of energy projects sustainability. So even if a project is say technically feasible, even if it is economically feasible and equally feasible and you've got access to financing, equally important are its social and environmental feasibility. Okay, just to clarify something from what you said there, when you talked about the word project, now is that because you're differentiating between something that the operator is going to do rather than actually what's down there, which I imagine we would all imagine is infinite in terms of the amount of energy that could be extracted? That's correct, team. And it's similar to oil and gas. You know, in oil and gas, we would talk about the accumulations in place in the subsurface, but that is not the same quantity that you are necessarily bringing to the end user, so to the market at the surface. And so we need to make that realistic linkage between a subsurface potential and how much of that potential can effectively be brought to the surface, potentially converted and then used by human beings. So indeed, in the case of geothermal, let's say you have sniffed the opportunity for a certain amount of heat in the subsurface. Well, that is what we would call the heat in place. But then in order to bring that heat to the surface, you need to have a carrier fluid, for example, water. So you need to be able to transfer that water from where it sits in the subsurface to the top of your wells. And then maybe from there by a pipeline to a power plant. And then what you get from the power plant is electricity. And that is the product that you would be classifying under the UNFC. OK, perhaps you could illustrate. Can you talk us through an example that would pick up on all the points you've just described? Yes, well, first of all, I can say that the UNFC is applicable to all types of geothermal resources. So I can pick examples that could be EGS, Enhanced Geothermal System Examples, or Advanced Geothermal System Examples, or much shallower type of resources like geothermal mine water. Can I interrupt? Because you used three letter acronyms, which I think you and I might understand. But could you just say again what EGS and AGS are? I heard the words in the... But what is that? What are those two techniques? Yes, and apologies if I went too quickly on that. So EGS stands for Enhanced or Engineered Geothermal Systems. AGS stands for Advanced Geothermal Systems. AGS, AGS, so the latter is a more recent term which has been introduced perhaps to differentiate closed loop systems from open loop systems. I'm probably introducing even more jargon now, which is certainly not helping. I'm aware of that. But coming back to EGS, if I make an example of that, there would be a situation where you have two boreholes, usually quite deep. And then of the two boreholes, one is acting as the production well and the other one is acting as the reinjection well. And between the two of them in the subsurface, you would envisage established hydraulic communication by enhancing the subsurface, i.e. by creation of artificial fractures that wouldn't naturally be there. Sometimes the creation of artificial fractures is not required. And you might need to just do a localized chemical stimulation of either the injection or the production borehole or both. When I talk about AGS, I can talk about closed loop solutions where you deliberately try to go away from the dependency on a fluid circulation in the natural environment down there. And you create artificial loops like an artificial series of pipes and you circulate a secondary working fluid brought in by you into the system to just extract the heat and not a geofluid. Understood. So coming back to an actual example, then I deviated you there from that. So take us through what you would go about determining what the resources were and what category of commerciality or whatever. Well, for example, let's go back to the EGS example I mentioned earlier. Let's start from the end of the use of the UNFC. The end would be the quantification of your energy products recoverable from that doublet. And if you are anticipating producing electricity from that EGS project, your energy product would be electricity. So then the question is how much electricity can I recover from that doublet over its lifetime? Let's call the lifetime 20 years. It can be more, it can be less. But you've got to fix the project lifetime as we do in oil and gas. And it is around the established, tentative perhaps, by established project lifetime that you then assess the quantities that can be recoverable from the project and the associated commerciality of those quantities, as well as the overall social and environmental viability of the project. So the project is whatever connects the subsurface to your final point of sale. Let's call it the power plant in this example. That's the project. And the quantities are the total quantities recoverable over 20 years from that project. And so the system UNFC allows you to then decide whether the project is ready to go, whether it's not mature enough because perhaps you're still gathering the required permits or whether you're still getting the required permits. Or whether it's not ready enough because the technology is not ready. Or whether it's not ready enough because you are still at the very early stage of the initial GNG, geological and geophysical assessments. Okay. Do you have a specific example you want to share with us? It's not vital. I don't think we can talk about. But just to illustrate perhaps. Well, I can give you only examples that we have officially published in the public domain. And these are not necessarily of EGS projects. But to give the audience here also reference that might go back to in 2021, following a series of in-country workshops, we produced a report that captured high level assessments of the Mataloco project in Indonesia. The Wharton wave and loader project in Dominica and also the Aluto project in Ethiopia. You might wonder why these particular locations, why these countries? That's because at the time the International Renewable Energy Agency, the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Program and International Geothermal Association joined forces to run this series of implementation workshops. And we collaborated with national, regional and local partners to assess the geothermal energy potential in those countries and to identify pathways for translating that potential into actual development projects. And I would like to add that also those events were fundamentally aimed at building local capacity and creating ownership of the process on the ground. And so we used the UNFC in hardness. We sat down with teams as you would do in a corporate environment. For example, you get your geologists, your geophysicists, your engineers, your economists. And we tried to look at the entire feasibility of these selected real life projects. This is a matter of technical curiosity here because you talked about the establishing how much energy you could produce over say a 20 year period. So how do you go about establishing that? I mean, I understand that you're for the EGS example, you're drilling a couple of wells, an injection one and a production one. But can you take us through a bit of the analysis that you then do to say, OK, in 20 years, this doublet will produce this much energy, whether it's heat or electricity? Yes, you would take very, very, very much the same approach that we do in oil and gas already. So you need to build your models. These models can be as easy or as complex as you want them to be depending on the amount of data and the reliability of the data that you have at the moment when you do the assessment. And then you you crunch these calculations in order to produce your estimate. And please know that this estimate can be as we do in oil and gas, your P10, P15, P90 range of estimates so that you have an envelope of uncertainty, what we call the level of confidence in UNFC jargon. And you carry this forward and you map this amount in the UNFC framework. And so in geothermal, we would normally start from an initial conceptual model of the geology and also the thermal equilibrium status of the subsurface, whether it is equilibrium or whether you still have a dynamic evolution of the thermal state down there. You would bring in information on the geochemical composition of your fluids if you have it. Otherwise, you will have to assume it on the basis of local geological knowledge and maybe analog fields. And then you would bring in the dynamic components, the flow components with a dynamic simulator. Before you get into dynamic simulations, if you want to, you can take the classic heat in place formulation, you superimpose an estimate of the recovery factor, and you can run that through a Monte Carlo approach to generate your P50, P90 and P10 profiles. Okay, like a material balance effectively, or rather heat balance instead of the material balance to change language there. So let's go to the other end of the calculations you're doing, which is that you're saying whether or not this is economically a viable project. And of course, that, I think, to a logic sense is a concern for many people, which is the value of a ton of water is an awful lot less than the value of a ton of oil. And so the revenue stream is a concern because unless that's sufficient to cover the costs and generate a reasonable rate of return, then the project's not viable without some kind of a subsidy. So can you tell me, where would you get your estimates of what price you'd receive for your heat or your electricity? What are you doing in order to get some confidence in the sale of the actual commodity? Well, for a moment there I panicked. I thought you were going to ask me the magic question, how do you make a geothermal project economic? It's a slightly easier question. So you would go by the starting statement, I would say that obviously the commerciality of a geothermal project is so geographically dependent. And it is particularly so for heat when the product is heat, because heat is not easily transportable. And so you need to have a local market where local means next to or very close to where the heat is extracted. For electricity, you've got a bit more of room, but you need to verify whether you've got the infrastructure to connect to, whether you've got the grid to connect to. And I know this might sound trivial, but effectively many projects today, many deep geothermal projects today are still stranded because of the lack of local infrastructure. An equivalent could be for oil and gas, where we have experience with the lack of pipelines and surface infrastructure for some unconventionals in some areas of the world. So you need to understand your local market, your local infrastructure, your connection, connectivity point. And if it is electricity, do you plan to go into the national grid or you're planning to go into a local smart grid that already might be a determining factor in deciding the price of electricity? Understood. Okay. So another thing that's particularly important if I go to the oil and gas side is this issue of ownership. Now, in essence, if you're going to write a competent person's report under pretty well any of the oil and gas standards, then the issue of ownership of the oil and gas has to be established. And if that in most countries is the government or the Crown, then there are usually some sorts of fee that will pay. So could you talk a bit about the ownership of heat within the jurisdiction of the globe? What typically happens? Can you give us examples of where the Crown owns it or the Republic? Yeah. Well, it's a key question really when it comes to geothermal projects and specifically projects on heat. So let me give you an example in the UK where I'm based. And then I can probably also talk a little bit about the situation in the US. Yes. Well, in the UK, although the Crown owns the right to oil and gas, the law is silent on the ownership of geothermal heat. What actually constitutes geothermal energy is not currently defined in the UK. However, as heat can only be transferred from the subsurface to the surface by a medium of some sort, for example, groundwater, then it appears that any substance suitable to this purpose will be capable of ownership. So when when you talk about water, you will also trigger the attention of the relevant local environmental agencies. And they will want to know what you're doing with that water, whether your project is by any chance a risk of altering the geochemical composition of that water, whether it's a risk of altering the pressure equilibrium in the subsurface, which could then in turn cause maybe subsidence. And whether your risk of altering the thermal equilibrium in the subsurface, which maybe could induce some localized thermal cracking. Now, if you go to the US instead, well, many states have potential for geothermal energy development, as we know, but some have legislation that leaves the nature of the resource unclear. So how these resources should be exploited and establishing definitely who the primary regulator is needs to be clarified. And this tends to go state by state in the US. So states may classify geothermal resources under legal doctrines that govern groundwater appropriation or according to oil and gas and mineral principles, or they might be using a hybrid system. So under the property law, heat is not a tangible item that can be owned. And so the question tends to be around again, like in the UK, the carrier of the heat, such as the water. And an interesting aspect of geothermal energy is that some geothermal fluids may contain minerals, in which case minerals ownership rules may apply. And it might be perfectly possible that you have multiple products from a geothermal project and you might need to abide to different ownership rules. Do you know, as you're talking, I was thinking about the difference between, for example, AGS and EGS, or indeed in some cases, just using natural aquifer pressure to bring hot water to the surface. And I just suddenly got struck with a thought that depending on how you define your reservoir extraction strategy, it could change the ownership. So if the molecules of heat are not something that can be owned, and an AGS system would say, well, you own it because you're producing the heat using your own water and the water never touches the rock. An EGS system, you could argue, well, we're lending you the water because we're going to send it back up to producer in due course. But a system where you're using natural reservoir energy, then actually you're extracting water from the subsurface and therefore a quite different regime might apply. I think you're right in that the three scenarios you have highlighted, the conventional hydrothermal system, the EGS system where you bring in artificially the circulating fluid in the created heat exchanger in the subsurface, and the third case of closed loops. They are all different. So clearly in hydrothermal conventional systems, you take out simultaneously the fluid and the heat that it carries. But then these days, especially we re-inject the fluid as well. You have to demonstrate to the authorities where you're injecting it, et cetera. But at least in hydrothermal, it's clear you're extracting both, at least from the production wells. In EGS, yes, you bring in artificially a fluid, which, by the way, may be another sustainability issue, given that we are facing in the world a water shortage crisis. So we need to make a case for upscale of EGS where we need to take the water from somewhere else. And then again, you're producing, but then you're bringing it back. Once you start the loop, you bring it back on the ground. In EGS, you're not extracting any geofluid, which is the reason why there are some proposals of EGS that you're not depending on the existence or the production of a geofluid. But yes, you are extracting the heat. Okay. Before I turn to the quite substantial number of audience questions that have come away, I do want to ask this question because this, after all, is an SBU discussion. And that's that there are many oil and gas specialists within the Society of Energy Engineers who are looking to pivot or have great interest in looking towards geothermal. Can they get involved in the kind of things that you're doing? Can they learn how to apply the framework you're describing, develop it? Talk us through how you might get more involved in what you're doing. Thanks, Tim. Well, first of all, the SPE is already and has been involved for many years in the development of the UNFC family of documents. The SPE is represented in the expert group of resource management of the UNICEF. And in fact, the UNFC is already breached to the SPE PRMS. And so the collaboration has been closed over the years and we envisage that to continue over the years. Possible ways are obviously for anyone out there who's interested to contact the UNIC via the email which is put on the website of the UNIC to ask to be included in the EGRM annual meetings. And everyone is welcome to participate. These annual meetings tend to happen usually in April every year. And then you might even be able to volunteer for specific subcommittees. And so as you start to participate in these annual meetings, you will be able to understand what is of interest to you, what is not of interest to you and where you would like to help. It's all voluntary work. I can also envisage particular synergies with the SPE when it comes to deep geothermal solutions. I mentioned earlier that the UNFC geothermal specifications covered the entire range of geothermal resources, but maybe the SPE is more interested in deep geothermal. And we are all interested in further development of guidelines for the quantification of the resources. So UNFC is really a place for classifying your estimates. But maybe co-developing best practices for the quantification of digital resources could be an exercise where the various organizations involved could come together. Interesting, yes, because of course there's an awful lot of modeling skills and we have our own technical sections that do just about all that. Okay, there are a few questions I just want to whizz through from the audience. Some of them, I mean, they're not specifically on the topic that we've described, but I think they're still worthy of sharing. Here's one. Is levelized cost of geothermal energy an output of the assessment in a feasibility study? And is it a good indicator? Interesting question. There are two questions in there. So first of all, is it an output? I would say it's an output of the overall project feasibility assessment that the owner of the project or the interested party would be performing. And then once you have that economic assessment, you would be able to flag in UNFC whether that corresponds to ready to go, not ready to go, or in between. And so on the E axis of the UNFC, you would be able to place the findings of your economic assessment. So UNFC doesn't do the calculation for you as a magic tool. The UNFC is a place for you to locate your economic assessment. And the second question is, is it a good indicator? Well, it depends on what levelized costs we mean here. We mean here, historically, we have been comparing energy sources in terms of the levelized cost of electricity. That would not be a fair indicator if you are considering a heat geothermal project. So we tend to also use the levelized cost of heating. Or maybe we should be moving forward towards a levelized cost of energy for which an up-hold for up-hold comparison is not straightforward. OK, I thought it would be a difficult answer. OK, here's another one. I'm interested to understand how the modeling of convection in the formation and conduction into the well is modeled, as this seems to be unpredictable. Well, again, the UNFC doesn't do this modeling for you. The UNFC is a classification framework, so allows you to enter it with the previously quantified quantity. So this is a quantification question, but I'm happy to take it as well. So how do we do the modeling? The modeling will really be strictly related to the type of project that you have. As we said earlier, is it a hydrothermal open-loop project? Is it an EGS project? Is it an AGS project? Is it a deep-boholite exchanger? Is it something else? The engineering flow modeling and thermodynamic modeling tools for each of these opportunities change quite significantly. Whether there is convection in addition to conduction, this will be based on your understanding of the local subsurface situation, whether you have permeability and what scale of permeability you have, if it does allow large scale movement of fluids or not. Here's one. Why would regulators, for example, stop exchanges, be interested in applying this framework? Well, we have a present already. So before the UNFC came out for geothermal energy resources in 2008, Australia put forward the Australian Geothermal Code and that was driven specifically by the Australian Stock Exchange requirements. So we have a present already and you will find online some resource assessments that were carried out according to that code. Now, interestingly, a few years later, the state of Queensland in Australia has actually been the first state in the world to legislate the use of UNFC for geothermal resources. So we take it as a very positive and encouraging acknowledgement that UNFC has done it right for geothermal. And now from the very same country that first developed a geothermal framework, we have the blessing for the UNFC. Interesting. Yeah, because I think that original 2008 standard was more based on the mining standards, which is quite extensive in Australia because they're very strong on the JORC standards. All right, I'm going to ask you a cheeky question now then. So why might geothermal operators perhaps not like to have regulation? Well, obviously, if you have no regulation, it means that probably you don't even have royalties to pay, that you don't have to report to too many organisations. So certainly many operators may see this as an opportunity to have less restrictions, less demands on project development. However, my personal opinion is that as we hopefully start to really upscale geothermal energy implementation worldwide, that we will want to be careful about not having projects that interfere with one another. And I'm referring to thermal interference as well as hydraulic interference. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, the equivalent of a kind of equity determination between blocks, oil and gas projects. Yes, of course, you're going to have the same thing. As well as being able to show the potential. So if you don't use these tools, you are not able to attract attention of governments and investors to say, hey, there is money here. I mean, I think that's where I come from. I say, you know, ultimately, in order to raise money, we've got to convince bankers and equity providers that we have confidence in what's down there and what the level of uncertainty is and indeed where the project is in terms of its development, both commercially and technically. So, yeah, I mean, it seems absolutely correct that we should go all out for this. I rather regret that we are almost out of time. So what perhaps I'd ask you, Joya, is there any last remark you'd want to make, completely tangentially if you so desire, just to finish off. So to do something for our audience to think about. Thank you, Tim. I just want to say I've really enjoyed this chat and thank you for the opportunity to have this conversation with you and with the audience. Oh, it's been fantastic. Thank you again, Joya. It's a great pleasure to discuss this with you. Thanks for listening to the SPE Live podcast.

Energy Markets and Data with Adam Sieminski,"I'm Jason Notouris and this is SPE Talks to Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SPE podcast. If you have not subscribed yet, we encourage you to do so. It's a great way to keep up with the latest oil and gas technical trends and valuable information. As it is our monthly tradition, 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan joining us remotely now is our new tradition instead of in studio. Your column this month is Strengthening the SPE Conference Experience. And I'm assuming that title is going to lend itself to how you're going to answer my first question, which is of all the great programs that SPE offers, what do you find to be the most enjoyable and rewarding from a personal experience? Oh, by far it's our conferences, symposiums, workshops, any of our events where not only do we have technical sessions, but obviously it's the huge networking experience. And there's so many elements of a conference that I so enjoy right when the exhibition hall opens. I love walking the floor, looking to see what new technology is available, looking for colleagues that are in the booths catching up on where they are and what they're doing. And just listening to all the product demonstrations, you know, there's a sense of I find there's a sense of electricity in the exhibit hall. And then, you know, as I'm bouncing back and forth from the exhibit hall to the technical sessions, you know, just being able to run into my fellow SPE members and also catching up with what they've been doing. And, you know, even when I leave a technical session, I like being able to turn to the person next to me and say, hey, what did you what did you just think about that presentation? You know, we heard and then, of course, there's all the the luncheons, the the breakfast speeches and all the evening activity. Right. And I for many of our bigger conferences that I. Have been. It's a tradition for me to go to. I almost look at it as a reunion, you know, and that's where I get to to see everybody. So, yes, that was a long answer to your question. But hands down, by far, our SPE conferences and events. I almost feel like I'm not allowed to use the word nostalgic, but it almost feels nostalgic. It's only been a few months, but I almost feel like I can say I remember the day when I got to go walk the exciting halls of the exhibition floor, listen to technical sessions and in the way that you painted the picture, I can visualize it all. And it's almost like a flashback memory. The new normal has kind of changed the way that we approach how we're able to do conferences. And as much as we all are yearning to go back to these in-person events and for them to return, I suspect that they're going to be a little bit different for SPE moving forward. Yes, but to say a little bit different is really understated. It's going to be a lot different in not just how we proceed with the events, but actually who's going to attend because, you know, we are going to have members who aren't going to be able to travel because of restrictions or they're still uncertain or feel uncomfortable. There's a picture with my column in the JPT and it's a picture of a bunch of us sitting in front row at ATCE. I believe that was the one in San Antonio. And now if you look at this picture, you think, oh, my God, everybody's sitting so close together. Isn't it weird the way that the mind does that right now? Pictures that you wouldn't even think about six months ago, you look at them now and that feeling just kind of comes over you. You second guess it a little bit. Exactly. And just even outside of the social distancing norms and practices we're going to have to put in place. You know, we've been trying for years to offer stuff in the virtual medium. Again, it's a way to reach more and more members that aren't able to travel or, you know, because of work restrictions, say, for example, if they're working field operations in Midland. But it's been very hard to convince our members on the program committees to take that leap into the virtual space. And I can't blame them because, you know, I have many hesitations myself that I actually get into this column because there's so many people that you have to look through their lenses on how they would how would they how would they accept the virtual media? There are a lot of elements to take into consideration for this. So let's start with the exhibitor experience, the type of value that could be gained from that from a virtual and when it's compared to a physical event. Yeah, I'm glad that you mentioned that we're starting with the exhibitors because at our larger events, we cannot Put them on financially if it was not for the revenue that's brought in from the exhibitors. They are a very important part of these larger events. Because it allows us to do so many of the other programs with the events, a lot of the networking aspects and you know we already before the pandemic. We had already been approached by many of our larger exhibitors saying that they don't feel in today's realm that they are realizing the value From putting on a booth at our events, you know, they're expensive, they need manpower to staff them and there's a lot of shipping and setup costs with it. And, you know, it used to be that was probably one of the only options they had historically to reach out to a large group of customers, but because there's been so many advancements in digital marketing. And that is now not only proving to be just as effective, but it's become very competitive for us trying to do like these in person or the traditional booths, but you know, can you Can you, or I shouldn't say you, can the exhibitors realize value and get customer engagement by having virtual exhibition halls which go along with virtual conferencing. And that's something that we're going to have to, we're going to have to figure out and you know we've done a few events just most recently we had the virtual booths. There was a virtual exhibition hall per se and keep in mind too that as these different virtual events roll out and we're testing Different medians don't assume that just because the way one virtual conference was set up. That's how the other ones are going to be like because we're testing out different platforms. So the platform that was used at ERTEC didn't really hit the mark for me in terms of the virtual exhibition hall. But I have seen the setups for different platforms that we're going to be testing within SPE and I think there'll be a lot more interactive and just better overall for both the exhibitor and for the attendee. That's good insight and thank you also for just being transparent about it too and giving the honest feedback. Because I think that's a good point to know that the SPE is testing some of these platforms so the user experience may be a little bit different, but the end result is to discover and find the best user experience both from the exhibitor standpoint and the attendee standpoint that also will be beneficial to SPE as a whole.

Another key contributor to these events are the authors because for many it's a coveted opportunity to present a paper at an SPE conference, especially a conference like ATCE. Well, ATCE is our crown jewel as far as author submissions go, and it's actually the most competitive. And for anyone that's listening who has submitted an abstract to ATCE in the past and had it rejected, please keep in mind that yes, even a very high quality abstract submitted to ATCE can get rejected because the acceptance rate is between 8 and 10 percent. On average, it's extremely competitive, so please don't give up if that's one of your goals is to present an ATCE, but just really understand and don't take it personal. It's extremely, extremely competitive. And I remember when I got my first abstract accepted at ATCE and was able to present that was at the 2003 ATCE that was held in Denver. And I still can vividly recall and sense all the feelings that I had when I was standing up at that podium. And when I say standing up at the podium, you know, you're there hoping that the audience can't see your knees shaking. And then, you know, I see my mentor at the time. He was the P&O technical director on the SPE board, James Pappas. I saw him enter at the back of the room and that instantly kind of gave a sense of calm for me knowing I had that support. And then, of course, you know, once you do your presentation, you're hearing some of the whether it's the laughs because you purposely made a joke or, you know, at the end of the conclusion, just hearing that applause. You know, this was all done in a virtual platform. I wouldn't have felt any of these emotions. Mind you, I'm pretty sure no one would have been able to see my knee shaking in the virtual element. But again, it's less engaging because you're not able to read and hear the audience, which for someone like myself, I need that. But it does offer an advantage to an author if they just can't be there to present physically. And, you know, we've had we have had papers withdrawn in the past just because authors are not able to get a visa to come into the country to present or for some other reasons. And fortunately, we have the no podium, no paper in one petro policy. And by them being able to, you know, this offers more of an opportunity than for this not to happen. And they still are able to present and get that paper into one petro. I think it's interesting how you mentioned not being in that room in that atmosphere and how that can change everything. Major League Baseball is starting back up in the United States and there will not be fans in many of the stadiums. And what some of the crews have been doing is actually pumping just just fan sound through the speakers in the empty stadiums. Some stadiums have cardboard cutouts of people. There's no replacement for actually having that feeling of being able to look out and see the audience. I've heard I've heard about that with the cardboard cutouts. And I've even heard of apps being available to fans that will they can, you know, as they're watching it, whether it's on their iPhone or tablet, as long as the microphone's on, they can they will capture, you know, their sounds. And like you said, pipe it into the stadium. It's going to be really bizarre. You know, obviously, you know, as we go as we go in the virtual space, we're not going to have empty facilities where we're going to have to look at putting cardboard cutouts of Dr. Blassingame or some of the standard folks. Let us do that to be honest. Oh, what a sight. So so let's talk about that. Let's talk about that. That attendee experience then because I know you've spoken on panels and you've attended panels and some of these virtual events. So what's that experience like? Let's first talk about the panel experience and then just listening to a technical session, for example. And, you know, I've obviously done both. You spoke on a panel or attended many and I enjoy the panels, especially if they have the right people on the panels with a very good moderator. Now, when I'm in the audience, I enjoy listening to the lively banter between panelists and it's, you know, hopefully there's a sense of camaraderie or even to there's some disagreements. Again, it's not only entertaining. It can be very, very informative. And then when I'm on the panel, I like to actually stir things up amongst my panelists, too, again, to make it more engaging for the audience. So I listen to both panels and technical presentations at ERTEC. And by the way, many, many, if not all of the panels were fantastic. They're very, very well done. By the way, they're available on demand. So if you did not register and attend ERTEC, you will have access to those soon. If you already had registered and paid, you can actually go in any time and watch those on demand. And the panels were done well for the authors doing the technical sessions. They were done well and had a sense of engagement. But there were some that had pre-recorded the presentations. It was not there for me, to be honest. Again, you weren't able to ask questions. And a lot of it just kind of seemed robotic, to be honest. So again, that's something we're really going to have to improve on because this is able to reach out to more and more people that normally wouldn't have been able to attend. So we're learning. Well, I think that the on-demand aspect is very interesting. Where in the past, maybe you may have wanted to attend an event, but you were unavailable that week. With the on-demand format, you could register. You wouldn't get the live interactions, but then you could still access the content maybe the week after the event, which I think is kind of an interesting twist on being able to get some of this content that still would have been available in one petro in a paper format, but now getting more of the presentation style. And that kind of leads into my next question, because as a conference attendee, a lot of people actually block out a week of their work calendar to focus on that conference. Absent of any type of office disruptions, a lot of people travel. How are you seeing that change in this new virtual environment? It's the same with working remotely. Working remotely, it's at times you have more of the personal disruptions, whether it's you're on a call such as this and all of a sudden the dogs start going crazy, or you've got children with homeschooling questions. But it's the same too if I was sitting in the office, always having someone kind of pop in and interrupt and say, how are you doing? So you have those level disruptions, but this is again why I love traveling to the conferences, because then you're fully immersed into the experience. And, you know, my calendar is completely blocked off. So people know not to schedule a meeting or will understand why I'm not picking up my phone because it's probably on silent because I'm sitting in a technical session. And so it's a lot easier for me just to just concentrate on trying to get as much value from attending that conference as I can. And then, too, you know, it's because you're trying to get as much value, you're running to the exhibit hall, you're going to this technical session. Typically at the end of every day, I'm in my hotel room, my feet are tired. I've got to put my feet up. But then I use that evening just to mull over not only what I heard, but to connect with people who I just met that day by following up with with email saying, hey, OK, here's my contact information and then start planning the next day of which sessions I'm going to go to and what demonstrations I want to see in the exhibit hall. So what we're trying to do and we're trying to experiment is some of the virtual full days and some of them where they're just segments. And for our tech or tech followed the same format that they would have done for an in person the full day as they when they switched to virtual. And while I did not get sore feet running from session to session and checking things out, I did get a sore derriere from sitting down in front of my computer all day long. So at least then with the disruptions, because everything was being recorded, if I man if I end up missing something, I was able to go back and watch it. And then that kind of took me out of participating in the Q&A. Hey, now when it came to the Q&A, the one thing I did like, especially when it comes to answering or asking questions of the authors, the platform that ERTEC used was you could see obviously the questions from everybody and then you could like it to say, hey, yes, please make sure to the moderator that this questions get asked. And they used a Slido, which is a virtual Q&A that we actually do in a bunch of our in person events within SVE. So I like that. And it probably helped the moderators out to flush out the questions that the audience really, really wanted asked. That's really interesting aspect because you think it also builds engagement and connectivity a little bit too, where you are going to be paying a little bit more attention to both the presenter and the questions because you want to make sure the right questions may be one that you have as well is getting asked. So that is really neat. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members.

My next question, the networking aspect, the connectivity of it all, how people are able to exchange ideas, communicate with one another, network in this virtual space. A point or discussion that I just had a few days ago with our SPE CEO, Mark Rubin, and it was when people are paying to attend one of our events, really, what are they paying for? Are they paying to see the paper or are they paying to network? And both of us are in an agreement that, at least for him and I, we're really paying to network with our fellow colleagues. And so this is how important it is for us to be able to deliver on this in the virtual environment. And it's going to take work not only from SPE, but even as an attendee, you're going to have to work harder to network. It's not like you're going to be able to see somebody across the room and then head on over and introduce yourself. And in my article, I mentioned a column that I had read in Money Crashers, and it was titled, How to Make the Most Out of Attending Online Virtual Conferences. And, you know, it says you have to take a virtual conference as seriously as you take in-person events. If you're focused, engaged, and motivated, you can get just as much out of attending a conference from your living room as flying across the country for it. And again, using the ERTEC example, it's just not going to take work. It's going to take a lot of work and it's going to take the right platforms. Now, there was a networking component within the platform used at ERTEC that, to me, again, did not hit the mark. I've seen what is offered in other platforms that we're planning to use, and trust me, I think it's going to be a lot better. But again, you have to have your profile out there. You have to be reaching out and engaging with people, being active in chat rooms so people can actually see that you're there to do like a follow-up discussion. And I'll give an example. I was watching the hydraulic fracturing session at ERTEC. This is one way to you can post a question out there, but it's not just actually asking the question of the author. It's showing people who else is in attendance. So I saw a question posted by Karen Olson and I was like, hey, my friend Karen, she's on there. That reminds me I have to reach out to her. And then I saw another question by Mary Van Domlin and it was like, yeah. Yeah, I almost felt like, OK, I'm actually feeling a sense of networking, but also, too, I'm kind of envisioning who of my colleagues are watching this on me and gave a sense of community, for lack of a better term. But I did find the platform at ERTEC while you could ask questions and any of the like there was a tab where you could ask questions and then there was a tab where you can just do general chat. And the general chat, I could not get it to work in any of the sessions that I attended. I didn't know if that was just operator error or that was a glitch of the platform, but we're definitely going to be looking to improve on that. So I'm hearing a lot of highs and lows of this new experience. But to sum it all up and correct me if you think I'm misinterpreting this, but you get out of these virtual events what you put into them as an attendee or even honestly as a presenter, whether or not you're going to bring your A game or not. And I'm not envisioning that mindset being too different from an in-person event or any other obstacle that you may have in life where what you put into it can be what you get out of it in terms of just the experience. And then everyone's going to have their own scale of adoption rate of how they can or cannot adapt into this. I know that SPE is trying to provide resources along the way to help the different experience levels of how we've mentioned exhibitors, paper presenters, attendees, and how everyone can kind of come together in this virtual realm because it's probably not really going anywhere. This week alone we have LACPEC in the HSE and sustainability conferences both being virtual. Yes, the LACPEC is going to be a different platform, but I'm not 100% confident on that. But the format is going to be different in the fact that it's going to be smaller chunks of time again. So you're not necessarily sitting on your derriere all day long. The virtual events are not going to go away. This is a big inflection point for us where even once we can start holding in-person events again, there will be some virtual component of it to allow more access for people to participate. And please be patient with us. And I'm addressing this to the audience. You know, we're on the learning curve. We're trying to figure out not only what platforms work best, we're trying to figure out ways to add that networking experience. You know, the feedback is really going to be helpful. So please give us the good, the bad, and the ugly so we can get up this learning curve so much faster. Now, you just made me think, sorry, I'm going to do a bit of a tangent here again back to the presenter experience. And I'm almost wondering, because you can't hear the audience, whether people are going to change up the way they traditionally give a presentation. For example, many presenters will start off with a joke or interject humor or things to throw out to the audience. Like I'll even throw out questions into the audience, not necessarily wanting somebody to go up to the microphone at that point, but basically just trying to get a read. Right. And we might just stop doing that completely just because you aren't going to have that read. You're not going to have that in that sense of engagement unless we can figure out a way to do it, whether we start piping in people's reactions, just like they are for the Major League Baseball. I don't know. Inflections will change. And if anyone listening is a presenter, I am going to offer a free tip. I charge after this tip. But look in the mirror and change the way that you are either smiling or not smiling and record yourself and do at least three or four different variations of how you're holding your mouth when you were speaking. Your inflection will be completely different in each of them and see what works best for you as a presenter. And this is something that I mean, I don't I don't recommend you standing up in front of a podium with a room full of people and holding up a mirror and doing that really quick before you present. But this is something you can test out before you present virtually. Please get feedback or watch yourself after the fact, because I tried to do that in the past. But then once I'm up on that stage and I get into presenter mode, I tend to forget. And of course, one of the things I try and do is smile more. Because, like you said, not only inflection, but when I look back at video of pictures of myself, I always look so angry and I'm not. And so, you know, again, it's all even have it in my speaker notes to smile and, you know, sometimes you just also get in the zone and all that just goes out the window. But yeah, that's very, very good advice and just it's something that you have to keep practicing on just to kind of make it more mental and muscle memory. Well, I do want to get to the question of the month in just a moment. But before that, do you have any final thoughts about how we're dealing with this crisis right now? Well, this is how I ended my column was, you know, when hit with any crisis, the recovery from it can include stages of both reimagination and reform, resulting in emerging from it stronger than before. And that's definitely what we're doing now. We're retooling, doing, you know, trying to come up with new concepts. And again, they're not just concepts are going to be utilized as we ride through the pandemic. It's going to really reform the society. And to be honest, it's probably going to change our business model. That's something that as a board, we're going to have to look very hard at is how much do we have to change up our business model? What I mean the business model, about 70, 70, 75 percent of SBE's revenue comes from our in-person events in order to be able to provide all these programs. And in the digital space, are we going to be able to keep up with that? You know, should we be so heavily weighted in the event space as an association? This is something that we're going to be working very hard on as we develop our new five year strategic plan. But I really believe by being innovative, not only by being innovative, but by communicating against one another what what's working, what's not. We can reform the way we deliver the experience of attending a conference and again, make it more accessible to our members. And I really believe that this is going to be a significant step or perhaps even a leap towards our society emerging from this stronger and will reinforce and increase the value proposition of being a member in the first place. Good stuff. Good stuff. And for everyone listening, that tees up the question of the month just perfectly because we do want to know what additional advantages do you think virtual conferences will provide for you? So if you want to answer that question, please email president at SBE.org. So for everyone listening again, the question of the month, what additional advantages do you think virtual conferences will provide for you? Send your responses to president at SBE.org. Thank you so much, Shawna. Great episode. We only have one more left. I can't believe how quickly your term has gone by. Well, yeah, and it's either gone by in an airplane or sitting at the end of my dining room table. So it's it's had two total different polls during this experience.

HSE and Sustainability Conference with Francesca Viliani,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the November 2023 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast, creating our energy future with SPE President Terry Palish. And now your moderator, SPE Senior Technology Editor Trent Jacobs. Hi, everyone. I'm Trent Jacobs and welcome to the SPE Podcast. Today, I'm very happy to be talking with the 2024 SPE President Terry Palish. He's going to be talking to us about the impact that the energy transition is having on the industry and technology. Also, how the SPE is helping its members adjust to the shifting landscape. Glad to be here with you, Terry. Thanks so much for joining us. Maybe set the scene for me a little bit here by explaining a concept that you mentioned on your last podcast. This is the energy trilemma. What is that? Tell us. Tell us more about that. Yeah, sounds good, Trent. Thanks. And I'm excited to be talking to you today. So let's just kind of start with the building blocks here. So I think, as everybody knows, energy is a building blocks of all life. So, you know, human beings need chemical energy. And then, of course, for all of our everyday lives, we need energy. So so the so the world itself needs energy. Energy essentially drives everything. The other thing we have to understand and remember is that our population is growing. We expect by 2050 to have another one to two billion people on the planet, another 20, 25 percent. And at the same time, over two thirds of our world population live in some form of energy poverty. So energy is going to demand is going to continue to grow. The other fact is that currently 80 percent of the energy supplied to the world comes in the form of coal, oil or natural gas. Commonly called fossil fuels. And that percentage hasn't changed appreciably appreciably for decades. So at the same time, energy is increasing. The same time the need for fossil fuels is there. The public is still demanding that we begin reducing or demanding a reduction in emissions. So that really kind of represents what a lot of people call the trilemma. Basically, how do we as a society meet the world's energy needs of affordable and accessible energy that's reliable and secure, but also becoming evergreen and decarbonized? So that's what they call the energy trilemma. But to me, I actually think it's more the energy opportunity. And I say that because I believe it's the energy opportunity for our industry. We can get into this a little bit more later, but I believe we're the best suited to solve the energy trilemma. And we are solving it as we speak. OK, well, let's open that up a little bit, I guess. You know, from where you're sitting, what do you see the industry doing to respond to the trilemma? You know, set the scene for me. Yeah, sure. So look, our energy, our industry has been meeting the world's energy needs for decades. I mean, really, we, we, along with coal, helped usher in the Industrial Revolution. We've been developing new technologies, things that we never saw coming, deep water. You know, another good example that's more recent is shale oil, shale gas or unconventional development. The ability to take horizontal wells and put multiple rock simulations in them. They completely change the landscape in the U.S. and North America. Right now, natural gas is plentiful. We actually were building LNG import terminals before the shale revolution. Now we're building export terminals. The U.S. has become energy independent. What's also kind of interesting is that emissions have actually reduced during this time frame. And the reason they've reduced is because we've had the ability to switch from coal to natural gas-fired power plants. But the key aspect here to understand is that we're going to continue to need more and more energy, as I mentioned before. So we must continue to develop new technologies, technologies that we haven't even thought of, because oil and gas continues to be harder and harder to find and or harder and harder to extract. But we have a large number of reserves out there. We just need the technology to extract it. So at the same time, though, I think it's worth noting that we continue developing ways to reduce our carbon footprint and our carbon intensity. There's tremendous efforts to reduce slurring, to reduce methane emissions. It was just a report out by the EPA that discussed that, how emissions from methane has reduced over the last several years. So we're making an impact there. And then, of course, we have the new areas like carbon capture and storage, geothermal. This is why I like to call it our energy opportunity. Yeah, no, and I think for the engineers out there listening, they hear about these things and they see just what you're saying, opportunities to build and create something new that works to these, what are now global goals. So with that, let's zoom in a little bit more, I guess. So we talked about the sort of the societal issue, how the industry is looking at it. Now, take us through the lens of the SBE. What is the SBE doing on this front to keep members updated about the newest technology trends and some of these important industry developments that are really shaping their careers? Well, let's start with the mission. We just updated our mission statement as a part of the strategic plan. And it's a mouthful for sure. You may recall our previous mission statement started with to disseminate technical information. That's still a big part of our mission. But we actually start this mission statement with to connect. My good friend, Kamel Benassour, put it this way. Our goal or our mission is to connect our members with technology, connect our members with other members for collaboration and to connect our members with other members for collaboration. Connect our members with other members for collaboration and connect our members with our external stakeholders. So we're about connecting. And while there's many ways that we connect our members with new technology, and we'll probably discuss that in some future podcasts, I'd like to key on just one of those one of the ways we do that. And that's with our events. SP events go a long way to connect our members with technology, other members and the external stakeholders. We have about 100 events every year. I actually went in and I looked at the next 12-month calendar on sp.org. And basically, the good majority of them are in North America, Middle East, North Africa, and Asia, which of course is where the majority of our members reside. And it has tremendous oil and gas potential. But we also have a large number that are in Europe, Africa, Latin, and South America. So, you know, our goal is to continue linking the global network of people to technology and collaboration. Some other interesting facts about three-fourths of our events are conferences or workshops. So that makes up the large majority and the remaining are forums, symposia, or summits. So we have various formats for collaboration. Maybe we can talk about that a little bit, but also have a wide range of topics from traditional petroleum engineering-based topics like drilling, and completions, and reservoir, to energy transition topics like carbon capture and geothermal. And then what's really kind of cool now is you're starting to see these embedded in each other. So while we may go to the Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Conference, there'll be a session that discusses decarbonization, electrification of frac fleets, and things like that. And that's really how we need to get to. But that's really one aspect of how we keep our members connected to technology and new developments. Yeah, I kind of like what you said. It resonated with me when you said linking global networks together, because just in my own experiences of attending SB events, I definitely see that. I see people from opposite ends of the world meeting up for the fifth, the tenth time and exchanging ideas in real life. But forget what I see. I want to ask about your experiences, because you've been on Man on the Move recently. You're visiting with SB sections and members from around the globe. And as you kind of alluded to there, you're also participating in SB events and conferences. So let's dig into that just a little bit. What do these conferences mean to you? Why is this so important? Well, Trent, I think it's important for me to attend as many of these as I can, because, like I said before, our events exist for the sole purpose of connecting our members to technology and other members to collaborate and network. But one of the things I think I also want to mention here is that it's only possible because of the dedicated volunteers and the SB event staff that helped put these on. In fact, in addition to benefiting from events from a technology standpoint and networking, there's another benefit, and that is the volunteer opportunity, whether it's sitting on a program committee, leading a session or being a session co-chair, or perhaps as a participant, writing a paper, making a presentation at a workshop. It gives us a chance to display our technology. It gives us a chance to network. It gives us a chance to work on our soft skills and really is a cornerstone to professional development. It's been a big part of my experience. So I think attending and participating in these events is really one of the critical pieces of our ability to create our energy future. Okay, so tell me about where you've been recently. What are some of the recent events that you have attended? And share with us some of the takeaways. Sure. So I just got back from a trip to offshore Europe and the International Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Conference. Offshore Europe celebrated their 50th anniversary. Offshore Europe is a critical event for SPE. It's a long-standing event. It's critical to not only SP but to the region. We had over 800 exhibitors, 30,000 attendees over four days, plenty of distinguished guests. The International Fracture Conference was its third edition in Oman. It's an offshoot of our successful HFTC that we have in the Woodlands every year. They were hoping to exceed last year's number, which would be about 600 attendees. We had over 735 countries represented, which really is very great because of the international nature of that conference. 126 companies. The Oman Ministry of Energy and Minerals was present. PDO was there as the main host. So it's critical to the region. Both of those are important to the region to help solve local problems. Remember, one of our core values is global reach and local relevance. So you bring together a global audience to work on something that's got local relevance like the offshore Europe in the IHFTC. Well, tell me a little bit more about offshore Europe for a minute, if you will. Share with us how that show maybe represents the embodiment of all of these concepts we've been talking about, how it fits into the SPE program. Yeah, you know, offshore Europe is, as I said before, a critical event for us. The last event is held every other year. The last event was held in 2019. 2021 was essentially canceled because of COVID. So, you know, the question was, obviously Europe is a critical part of the mix. How would the attendees respond? Of course, as I said before, we ended up with 30,000 attendees. There were tons of technical sessions and panels and keynote speeches. There was a lot of buzz on the show floor. They had the Honorable Graham Stewart, who's the UK Minister of State for Energy and Security and Net Zero. They had the Scottish Minister of Energy, Ms. Gillian Martin. And both of them referenced the need for significant investment across all energy farms. In fact, I thought it was interesting. Mr. Stewart put it kind of this way. He said, you know, we need to stop thinking of these as individual industries, you know, oil and gas, wind and so on, and kind of think of us as a part of a global energy mix. So, you know, all of them are necessary. The conference had plenty of papers and panels that addressed all the needs of the energy trail that we talked about before. It showed our opportunity for our industry to make a positive impact on accessibility and affordability. Many noted that it would be far better to produce your own oil and gas to import it. It's got a lower carbon intensity if you can develop your own resources. So countries need to continue to do that. It's secure. Of course, in Europe, there was plenty of references to the the Ukrainian War. So producing your own is, of course, critically important. But then also plenty of discussions on decarbonization. A lot of efforts in carbon capture and storage, renewables, decarbonizing our operations, you know, really leaning into our industry and our engineers and scientists to help Europe reach its climate goals. It's a monumental task. Everyone understands that. But, you know, our industry, the oil and gas industry is well positioned to help lead that. So, you know, probably the biggest concern is that we need these new technologies and they're only going to be developed by people that come after us. You know, the best and the brightest minds. Just, again, reinforce my view that the energy trilemma is really our energy, our industry's energy opportunity. It was a great conference. You know, I do want to make a shout out to the S.P. Aberdeen section for their hard work. They were a big part of the programming. It was also great to meet that section while I was there. They're excited. They have a lot of energy. They're working with local leaders and schools on getting our message out. So hats off to the work that they do there. Well Terry, you know, kind of switching gears just a tiny bit, but sticking on this last point you raised, you know, one question I always get in my job at JPT and as somebody that works at the S.P. is how are the topics for the technical programs, you know, picked out? You know, who forms would essentially represent the core of these events? Talk to us about that a little bit. Well, quite simply trying to start with an idea. A lot of times those ideas are driven by staff because just people like yourself who see what's going on in the industry, what are the hot topics. It also might start with a board member or particularly maybe one of the technical directors or something from their advisory committees. Maybe they see a gap. Or maybe it's just a group of members in a region. You know, I just was in Tunisia and the Tunisia section was just reestablished. So congratulations to them. But they're excited about bringing unconventionals to that country. So the question is what kind of event can we put on to help that? So, you know, those are the way that the topics come about. You know, once once that topic is kind of discussed, then the organizers work with S.P. staff, try to make sure, you know, come up with the timing and the location and, you know, make sure it doesn't conflict with calendar. And of course, look at the P&L. I mean, you know, our goal is to have positive profit or at least not lose money. And then event request is taken to the board of directors, the technical committee signs off on it and you're off and running. So that's in a nutshell, Trent. That's how it kind of works. Well, and parse out for me, if you will, a little bit more, you know, there's there's different formats to these events. You know, some of them have slightly different names. And and so, you know, talk to me about the differences between these events and how how you view that. You know, Trent, that's an important question, because I think a lot of times we don't we don't typically understand the difference between a conference and a workshop and so on. So, you know, conferences kind of the largest version of our events. It's probably the most used to be the most common. So a conference is typically going to be made up of technical papers, panels, exhibition is likely going to be there. It's typically a larger event could be thousands of people. It could be a single topic or multiple topics. So for example, multiple topics like ATCE, our flagship member event, the annual conference or, or OTC, even though it is offshore, it's got a lot of technologies, then you've got HFPA, you know, a lot of different things. So, you know, we have the FTC, the hydraulic fracturing conference, which is a single topic. So all our conferences, but some have multiple and some are single. A workshop is kind of the other end of the spectrum. A workshop doesn't have any papers. It's presentation only. There's typically not an exhibition. The goal of a workshop is to kind of dive deeper into a single topic, or perhaps multiple topics in a single region or basin. A workshop is typically limited to and it's limited so that it can promote engagement and networking. It's typically a single track. Workshops are actually gaining popularity because you have the ability to go and work a problem. The information is very timely since there's not a paper required. So you can be presenting stuff that's literally right off the press. There's no need to release content. So then we also get people that come in and present material that they couldn't have potentially released in a paper. The other two, a symposium. Symposium is really kind of between a conference and a workshop. Typically, it's kind of a starter in a specific topic, maybe has a mix of some papers and some panels, minimal exhibition, if any. A lot of times section events are symposiums and maybe a symposium turns into a workshop or a conference later. And then you have forums that kind of sit by themselves. A forum is just really a way for 50 to 75 people to sit and talk about their experiences. We have technical experts, subject matter experts to get together and kind of swarm some futuristic problem or topic. It's an application-based event. So you apply to come and then get accepted. There's limited note-taking. It's all about thought leadership. A summit is typically just a smaller topic. Again, that's typically just a few members or smaller events to begin talking about a topic. I think it's important to understand those differences, though, because when you go to the SBE events calendar, you know what you're looking at when you see an event and they say it's a workshop, then you know what to expect. But even though they have similar names, what's interesting is they all have different personalities. Yeah, I think everything you said is really interesting because it just shows the degree to which you have the nuances that you have to acknowledge when you talk about industry collaboration. And there is no one size fits all approach. But maybe picking up on that last thing you just said, these events have their own personalities. You're personifying them. What do you mean there? Tell me about that. That's a phrase that Michelle Boyd, the SBE's Chief Global Events Officer coined. She said, you have to remember that each event has its own personality. And it's really true because we could talk about the type, the conference workshops, et cetera. It can be global or regional. Any of these can be global or regional. Any of these can be multiple tracks or themes. Like I said before, ATC or IPTC, global conference, or they could be single topics. You could have traditional petroleum engineering based topics like say the formation damage conference or maybe something on the energy transition like we had the CCUS workshop. We've got a geothermal workshop coming up. And then of course you have regional workshops that could be topical like well decommissioning in Brazil or you could have a regional topic or regional conference like the Western Regional or Eastern Regional or maybe a basin like the Permian Conference. Or maybe just some combination that meets the needs of the organizers. Then on top of that, we also use our events to connect with other non-traditional petroleum engineering disciplines like the SPIADC drilling conference. So we partner with IADC. ERTEC, a really good example, a very successful conference with AAPG and SEG. SP's core value, remember, is global scale. One of the core values is global scale and local relevance. So that's how we do it. Events are a great example of that. We bring our global network together to solve a problem and then hopefully deliver the best experience and value for our members. And so in order to do that, it kind of requires every event to take on its own little personality to make the event successful. I like that. I mean, it makes sense. These are conferences formed by people, for people. So they feel a little bit like people. Maybe to wrap up here, maybe you could talk to me about what the SPIADC is doing to stay fresh and continue to sort of enhance or offer the best experience that we can at these different events. Well, look, first and foremost, it starts with SP staff. Michelle's events team does a magnificent job of staying on the forefront of things and delivery mechanisms, as well as the board, particularly technical content committee and the TDs. You know, everybody's always on the lookout for ways to improve, whether it's improving the content or improving delivery of that content or maybe just the overall experience. You know, we want to always be on the cutting edge. I think SP's got a great reputation for putting on the best events, most technical and networking. You know, one of the things I alluded to last month in our podcast is we have an initiative underway to improve ATCE. We call it the ATCE Reimagined Group. It's made up of board and staff and an external resource. And really, we're looking at how do we revitalize the flagship event of our society? ATCE has always had a rich history. It's been our premier event. But members have said we need to revitalize it and they're right. And so as you heard, if you were in San Antonio a few weeks ago at ATCE, our next ATCE will be in New Orleans in 2024. That'll mark the 100th anniversary of ATCE. So, you know, our goal is really by this work group to lay the foundation for the next 100 years. So plan on coming to New Orleans. I think you're going to want to be there. It's going to be a lot of fun and very informative. The other thing we're doing, though, as I mentioned briefly before, is we're partnering with other societies, whether it's with ERTEC or like, say, IPTC, where we join up with AAPG, SEG, and EAGE. But, you know, we're always looking for ways to deliver enriched content or new ways to deliver enriched content. We also want to expand the tent into related technologies. There was an event earlier this year with the U of H alongside AAPG and SEG on carbon capture and storage. We've got an event coming up this month with Geothermal Rising, a geothermal workshop in Colorado. So, you know, the bottom line is we want to be known as the go-to place for events that promote technical exchange, thought leadership, networking, and really provide second to none experience. Well, that's pretty exciting news about ATCE especially. You know, this is a show that presents some of the, you know, best and most impactful papers that the oil and gas industry benefits from. And so that's good to hear. I think that's about it for us, though. I think we've run out of time. I had a lot of fun talking to you, Terry. Maybe you can tell everybody what's going to come up in your next podcast before we sign off. Yeah, thanks, Trent. This is a lot of fun again. I really appreciate you taking the time to interview and to be a part of this. I think it's important for our members. I think next month what we're going to do is we're going to continue our discussion, you know, about this connection, connecting our members to technology and each other. But I think we're going to try to do is maybe shift gears a little bit and talk about the importance of local sections. As I mentioned, I've been visiting plenty of sections and I think there's a lot of discussion we can have there about how important sections are. I think for most members, the section is what they think of when they think of SPE. It gives great opportunities for volunteering and really all the important aspects of what we need to do and what we can do to create our energy future. So I'm looking forward to it and I hope everybody will be able to join us. All right. Well, thank you so much, Terry. Bye for now. Thanks, Trent. We hope you have enjoyed this edition of the SPE Presidents Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts, on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
Energizing Our Lives: How to have a successful career in Artificial Lift Engineering,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, the role of pressure transient analysis in CCUS projects. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on December 13th, 2023. And now your moderator, Florian Hollander. Good morning, afternoon, or evening everyone. And welcome to SPE Live, the role of pressure transient analysis in CCUS projects. My name is Florian Hollander. I'm a scientific advisor at the Sub-East Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and I will be your moderator today. SPE Live will last for 30 minutes and we encourage you to ask questions throughout the events. The last few years have been exponential growth of interest around the geological storage of CO2. Putting carbon back in the ground leverages many of the technologies and know-how developed for oil and gas exploration and production. All right. With different constraints and objectives. Many projects are initiated with a high level of uncertainty regarding the nature of the subsurface that are usually resolved to a limited number of data wells. While production injection tests are usually performed in particular to assess injectivity, the role of pressure transient analysis does not appear to be as prevalent in CCUS projects as it does in oil and gas settings. It is to discuss those points and better understand the role that pressure transient analysis could take, I'm joined today by an experienced group of speakers. Let me start by introducing Dr. Anton Shipanov. Dr. Shipanov is the chief scientist at North Norwegian Research Center in Stavanger, Norway. He was a PhD in reservoir simulation from Perham State University and has participated in many R&D and consultancy projects over the last 20 years. Dr. Shipanov is the co-author of over 30 published papers. He has taught well testing courses at University of Stavanger, supervised masters and PhD students. His research interests include well testing, well reservoir monitoring and simulation applied to hydrocarbon production, geological carbon storage and geothermal energy. Our second speaker is Dr. Mehdi Zeidouni. Dr. Zeidouni is associate professor at the Department of Petroleum Engineering at CSU. He has 17 years of continuous research experience on various reservoir engineering aspects of CCS, starting with his PhD studies at the University of Palgaree in 2006, followed by his work at UTRC's Bureau of Economic Geology and then at LSU. He teaches reservoir engineering and well testing. He has also developed a new course on CCS as part of a CCS program offered at LSU. He has been awarded the teaching assistant award twice for his teaching efforts at New Zealand State University. And finally, we are also joined by Jordan Mimoun. Jordan Mimoun is the founder and principal consultant at Empire Well Test Consulting. He advises energy companies on design, planning and interpretation of well tests across oil and gas at CCS. Jordan was previously the principal reservoir engineer for well testing at ExxonMobil, where he oversaw their worldwide exploration tests and the production units during his 13 years at the company. His well-tested experience took him to every continent but Antarctica, if any of you has opportunities there. He has also taught well testing course to over 150 engineers and bio-scientists. He served as the JPTA Literary Review Committee as a chairperson of the SP Applied Technology Workshop on well testing. He has been a member of the well testing network since 2013. Jordan was a diploma engineer from the École Centrale de L'Inde in France and a master of science in petroleum engineering from UTRC. Hi everyone, I'm Van, Mehdi and Jordan. Welcome to the SPI. Jordan, let me start with you. Every CO2 ejection project starts by resolving some of the potential large uncertainties related to stratigraphy, basic formation properties and identification of potential targets. This is applicable at the early evaluation stage but also all the way to execution. The flow testing will offer part of that sequence, at least for delivery and estimation. How would you perform those tests to maximize the value of data we're gathering, considering that depending on approval and the status of the project and costs, you may flow water and or CO2, you may consider flowing or injecting. What you're thinking there? As you were asking the question, I could imagine people on the line thinking to themselves, either when obviously you've got to inject or obviously you've got to flow. And it might actually not be that obvious or clear cut because it depends on your early evaluation objectives, which will vary from project to project and what you're comfortable with. Either way, what you want to get out of a test is crystal clear data that helps de-risk whatever outstanding concerns the operator has to move forward with a project. So is it injectivity? Is it lateral connectivity? Is it both? Or is there something else at stake? So you might not have a one size fits all because not all aquifers share the same risks and accordingly, and very importantly, not all occurrences see eye to eye on the approach to mitigate those risks. The water injection test seems popular, especially if you're dealing with regulatory requirements that call for injection tests. Yet there are operators who aren't so sure that they can meet ambitious reservoir description objectives with an IFT and the elective flow instead or in addition. And all of that is with water. CO2 or even nitrogen tend not to be entertained, at least not very early on for practical reasons, especially offshore. For operators with a large portfolio of aquifer candidates to choose from, you might be able to exclude or de-prioritize them right off the bat with just water, inject or flow. If you are in a screening mode. And finally, the simpler the better, maybe when it comes to pressure transatlanticis. So if you are really testing for reservoir description purposes, which again might be irrelevant for some operators who are blessed with huge aquifers they know are continuous. But if you are honest to look at that and it's critical for you, in that case, you may want to do whatever you can to make the test a controlled experiment, like we always do in oil and gas. So you can really use it quantitatively to its fullest extent without any lingering doubt. With that said, interestingly, some operators do consider layering in CO2 sooner rather than later. It's part of that evaluation scope. And the considerations there are, A, get a glimpse of the injectivity with the actual freedom of interest, especially maybe if you are dealing with a vertically heterogeneous formation. And B, get a glimpse of what the pressure data might look like to manage expectations for surveillance and to potentially influence the instrumentation strategy for these permanent completions. Right. That's quite interesting. And I really appreciate the fact that you mentioned that sometimes it's regulatory and sometimes you want actually to get some data. So the data you're going to get varies depending on that. So, Anton, question for you here. Once you've acquired the data during CO2 injection in particular, then we need to interpret it, right? And as Jordan mentioned, the interpretation depends a bit on what you want to achieve. But one of the major holdups is that the physics involved can be quite more complex than we have in standard oil and gas because we have free displacement. We have a buoyancy effect, you have solubility effect, chemical reactions. So as a consequence, you know, the pressure response is not as simple as linear as we used to. So do we need that? The only option there is to go with full numerical simulation to try to extract value of interest or other other approaches that you may follow. Yes, thank you, Florian. It's a very interesting question, actually. And here I would like to share some lessons that we learned when we analyzed three years history of CO2 injection in the Saline Aquifer at the Snowit Field. And actually Snowit Field is a very good example because it's very well documented. First of all, Ekenor, the site operator, they published many papers on this stuff and also LND and Academia as well. So you can find quite good description of the case. And what we actually analyzed, it was the first period of injection of CO2 in this Saline Aquifer. And this is a Sunstone Reservoir offshore Norway. And what is interesting, this reservoir is divided by blocks by faults. So it's quite interesting to understand, first of all, sealing impact or sealing conditions on the faults. And also another question is if you have some subsystemic features that could also limit our injection and storage capacity. So all in all, actually, it was one well injection of CO2 for about three years. And it provided a very nice data set for both reservoir characterization and monitoring. A little bit about installation of the gauge itself. And the gauge was installed 800 meters above the sun face, which is quite usual for such wells. And this actually caused some limitations in the interpretation because if you have such a distance from sun face to the gauge location, you have always if you start injection or you start setting, you always have a quite large well storage effect. And what's happening in the well actually impacts significantly the response of pressure that you have. And in this context, actually, we were not able to interpret early time response. But what is good, we had very good late time response. And it was a repeatable time lapse pressure transients that we can analyze. And we can, by the way, what we saw, it's more or less repeatable, the same signature in all the transients. And when we started to analyze this data, you're perfectly right. We were quite uncertain about how to interpret this very good data set because it's a lot of physics complexity could impact on the CO2 flow inside the aquifer and how to interpret all these boundaries effects and all the stuff. But surprisingly, actually, we were able to match a series of transients and also the whole history of the CO2 injection with quite simple single face brine based model. And you know that single face models, they are widely used in PTA. It's a lot of actually different configurations, different flow regimes. They are already reflected and plot is good also. Then you can use this analytical model, we can get interpretation results by clicking the mouse. So it's not complicated numerical simulation in this case, and it's very time efficient and resource efficient. And so as a result, one of the lessons learned from this case, we got quite good match of all the transients and also the history as a whole. And you can ask me, what about CO2 flow? And in this case, CO2 flow was perfectly accounted for through the time dependent scheme. By the way, we also after that, we tried to understand how we can model this time dependent scheme. And we found that it's depends on the, fully depends on the size. So we can recalculate even by calculating this scheme. And the main lesson actually learned here, it was that if CO2 is localized near the well and not reaching the boundaries, we can actually use interpretation of fresh transients responses with classical single face approach to get very good representation of a reservoir boundaries and understand all these boundaries and flow restrictions inside the reservoir. So this is kind of one of the main conclusions and lessons learned. Well, that's interesting. I mean, depressing maybe for all the researchers who want to find new solutions to new problems. But maybe a question for you now, since you're there. Antoine has pointed out that at least for late time, we can do with simple is always good. We can always extract value, useful value, useful information from there. Now, do you believe that this also applies for new well ball region or there are much bigger limitations at play there? And what do you think you could expect to get from the new world war zone, especially the drive zone or the transition zones? If you have a proper data, the effect of global storage and the world design tests. Yeah, excellent. If you can eliminate the early time will be affects the world war storage, then there will be quite important information that you can get on the new world war. The major unknowns of interest in the new world war region may include the the first first injection profile that how you do is actually distributed over the injection zone. Second, any fracturing caused by non isothermal effects. We normally inject CO2 at a cooler temperature than there is a war. Also, there is a Joule Thompson effect. And that can cause some alterations to the permeability and fracturing. Geochemical alterations, rock and fluid interactions in the new world war with the cement, with the rock, etc. The salt precipitation because of the quite dry CO2 that we inject. Brine backflow, which can it can increase if we can worsen the salt precipitation, but can also cause some of the perforations to be not accessible for the CO2 that we want to inject. And other world war integrity issues. So these are major unknowns of interest when it comes to the new world war region. And if we don't eliminate the effect of world war storage within the first few hours so that we can see clearly the new world war region, because that's the time that we can see those. Probably we won't be able to say much about what are the alterations that can happen in the new world war region. But let's say that we place, as Anton mentioned, that we place the in their case, the gauge was 800 meters away from the sand face. If you place it as close as possible to the perforations and also have down hold shot in, then you could see the first few hours and we showed in our paper on falloff tests that you can actually estimate the extent of the dry out zone and also any mobility alterations within that zone. If salt dry out occurs. So in short, yes, but that needs a quite well execution of the test. Right now, thank you. That's really informative to remind everyone that this is not that simple. I'd like to remind everyone on the call at this point that if you have any question, don't hesitate to ask it. You can put in the chat section. We have time constraints and I'm sure you're going to give me any question, but we're happy to tackle as many as we can. Jordan, we touched just on the importance of getting good data, right? Anton mentioned that many reinforce that. You even mentioned down hold shot in tools. I have personal experience of seeing data where none of the thermal effects can have quite a bit of an impact. So there are a lot of tools existing for for testing, especially in the system testing arena, where the whole shutting tools, the measurement devices, but those are going to be maybe more difficult to deploy in CCS projects, if only for a cost standpoint. And so when you have that potentially very damaging impact of well bore effects that could dominate the pressure responses to when the ghost phase changes and starts moving around, that could be very detrimental to data quality. So we have any practical tips or ideas or requests for those on the call who work on the equipment that could help alleviate and reduce those limitations. Yeah, thanks, Florian. I think it could be useful to take advantage of that evaluation appraisal phase to confirm that that data collection plan is going to work out with CO2 and with the envisioned configuration of a permanent completion, because it feels like a lot of these data collection programs or wishful thinking inherited from decades of best practices of resource management with oil and gas. And whether that translates one to one to CCS is still to be seen. You mentioned, Antoine mentioned and Mehdi mentioned the storage effects, for instance. And that's one way to investigate that is with the DSC string, which opens a new kind of worms with cost. But it gives you the flexibility to include tools that you may not entertain for your permanent completions and take their impact. And you can collect quality data by using the downfall shutting tool. And then you can elect not to use it for one of a certain periods to see how negatively impacted a surface shutting would be and decide whether it warrants entertaining smart completions, sliding sleeves and things of that nature for the permanent completions. Likewise, you mentioned and I think you hit the nail on the head, Florian, wellbore thermal effects with a DSC string, you can have gauges along the wellbore to see the impact of wellbore thermal effects and whether pressure readings remain representative as you move further and further up. For oil and gas wells, this topic of wellbore thermal effects is pretty niche, pretty exotic. With CO2 injection wells, it has the potential to become more mainstream. And then the question is, do you fix it with formation phase instrumentation, which sounds easier said than done for permanent completions? Then you also need to think about the fact that the technology is not going to last a lifetime, so you need to have intervention to be able to replace it when it fails. Or do you go the workflow route and you look for ways to reliably convert those surface readings or shallow readings to formation phase readings? That makes perfect sense, right? It's even more marked here than in other cases. So, I'm staying on the question of measurements and data quality. You touched a bit on limitations with your gauge being somewhat offset in terms of data interpretability. So, if you had a choice, unlimited budget and any option of hardware deployment, where would you really want to have your measurements located so that you can maximize the value of the data? And beyond that, also the question of when. Are you okay using retrieval gauges and you target a bit your uncertainties and your acquisition plan by running in temporary gauges? Or you really see a value of having continuous permanent monitoring throughout the course of the project? Yes, thank you Florian. I think in any case, the best option is permanent whole gauge installed. And I can argue is this just because if you have permanent whole gauge, you can get real time data. And this real time data could be useful for permanent well monitoring, so you can try to understand what's happening on the way. And you have as a second point, you have a very good input for other simulations if you use a reservoir model to follow up and manage your injection. And you also have very certain reservoir volumes injected because this information is quite important if you inject CO2. And if you go a little bit farther about interpretation, you can if you have permanent whole gauge, you can interpret a series of time lapse responses. And you can actually, first of all, they see a repeated picture. If something is something happens and you have more or less stable process or if you see some changes, you can actually follow up on the changes and try to understand what's happened. And regarding this, also to support the point of view, PDG location is very important. If you have PDG as close as possible to the surface, as I mentioned, we can analyze near well-being effects. But on top of it, we also could have quite a certain injected volumes and all this information is very important. Price wise, I'm not sure, but it seems that PDG installation is not very costly nowadays and it's probably affordable for the companies. By the way, can I take Florian the question on the way that they got in the chat? Just OK. The question was if we have quite for well-tested, if we have quite limited budget, for example, of time frame or something like this, and we cannot, this is the question we cannot achieve boundaries, which is important to understand what we can do in this case. And yes, time wise, it's always important to have at least long shutdown period. So we might have pressure for a long time. And it's not very important how much injector produce during the test and how long you do it, because if you actually create a considerable disruption to your pressure in the reservoir, this disruption actually travels. And you can get understanding of all the boundaries, just question of time. And to make it even cheaper, probably and simple, if you are talking about exploration wells, you can try to use permadehull gauges or not. Not whole gauges that you can leave after abandonment of the wells. And these technologies are now developing. So there are different options if you have these limitations. Right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Let me let me rebound a bit on that and the question of volumes. Something very close to my heart, which is we have more than one wells. Right. And so maybe on the topic of measurements, there is a regulatory requirement to monitoring wells in pretty much every CS projects. And that's to try the movement of the CO2 plume. And we tend to have actually more data in observation wells than in injection wells. So this gives us more data, more sources of information, opportunities to perform interference testing. So you can see how the fluids are moving, how the pressure is moving from well to well. So how do you from your experience, how you see that data helping us understand not just the volumes as discussed, but also what's happening within the reservoir and the movement taking place there? And we have to say that I think you're on mute, Betty. Thank you. The observation wells have been used actually in the tests that we have had in the pilot projects. That's to test the interference and see what can be taken, what can be learned from those observations. But the pressure interference can be looked at within the injection zone, the in zone or in an above zone, above or separated by the cap rock from the injection zone. Within the injection zone, the minimum you can get is the CO2 arrival at the observation well. And in that case, if you have two wells in two directions by just observing when the CO2 arrives in either of these directions, you can tell in which direction the plume is moving faster. But that's the minimum really, because you can gain more. I've shown that in one of my recent papers that you can actually obtain the mobility of the CO2 and that can tell you something about how the, what is the efficiency of the sweep. And also it can tell, especially after the closure period, once you stop the injection, it can tell you whether how the CO2 is immobilizing within the injection zone, because it will, the mobility will reduce over time. That's about the injection zone. About the above zone, the interference, the above zone monitoring has been used a lot in natural gas storage projects. But it is mostly qualitative, not quantitative. What can be done is at least to easily establish whether there is hydraulic communication between the injection zone and the above zone, whether there is any migration of fluids from the injection zone to the above zone. And if there is, what is the nature of it? Is it because of a line source, for instance, a legacy well, or is it about a planar source, for instance, a fault, a leaky fault? Or it can be heterogeneities or discontinuities in the cap rock. But pressure, because it can distinguish between the flow regimes, for instance, linear versus radial, it should be able to tell us whether we have a source, which is line source or planar source, for instance. The, unfortunately, when we, when we have too much complexities, I mean, when we have CO2 injection, and at the same time, we want to model or to characterize a fault, a leaky fault, it is not as straightforward. The best way to do to do this is to test for the fault characterization prior to the CO2 injection. That way you can avoid the complexities that are caused by the two-phase flow nature of this after the CO2 injection. In that case, the complexities of a fault structure can be delineated and you can, in this case, mostly, we look for up fault flow. Something that we normally in petroleum literature, we don't look at. In petroleum literature, we are all familiar with the image well method where you look at the ceiling fault, or what we have leaky fault is mostly about cross fault flow. But there is no such a component as an up fault flow. And that is part of the research that I have done. And I propose this, but the complexity can be masked by the complexities that are caused by the CO2 injection. So it's better to do it prior to CO2 injection. Makes perfect sense. Simplify the complexity. We're slowly getting towards the end of the session. So I see many, many questions on the chats. We won't be able to cover them. I'll just ask one quick fire question for each of you in a way of closing. So we're going in order, starting with Mehdi, since you're already with us. What do you see, expect, hope to see coming up in the field of pressure transit analysis for CCS projects in the coming years? More techniques, more tools, more combination of measurements? Excellent question. I hope that we see more of above zone pressure monitoring and also looking for the effect of gravity and getting it from fall off tests. Combining the pressure transient with the temperature transient. These are some of the goals that I could see that if accomplished can be very meaningful. Makes sense. Jordan, what are your thoughts on the topic? I liked what Mehdi said. Pressure and temperature. We've been talking about temperature transit analysis for years and it didn't really stand out for oil and gas. Maybe that's in CCS that it will find its place and provide incremental value for the seismic to really track that clue. Pressure alone is just not going to cut it. It doesn't even cut it for oil and gas. You are going to be hot pressed to do everything with just pressure. And maybe more and more observation ways to really triangulate responses. Right. Thanks. And finally, Anton, what's on your Christmas wish list? Yes, I think that coming years we probably will see similar pictures of oil and gas. Many, many wells will be equipped with permanent hall gauges provided. A lot of new data. I think it will be both challenges for actually operational companies to analyze this data and also for R&D and academia. And for the last one, I think the main challenge will be to try to interpret flowing data. When we have, for example, injection period, we don't need to wait for shutdown and we can interpret this period as well. Yes, very good topic. With those parting words, I'd like to thank again all our speakers for participating, for your availability, for the time, for the insights. Thanks a lot to the audience for attending and for all the questions so we can cover all of that. And finally, Natalie, Asha and Eben from SPE, thank you very much for putting that together. This was a very engaging session, such an excellent follow up. To everyone, have a great day and a great end of year and hope to meet you soon."
Data and AI in the Petroleum Industry with Jeff Baetz,"Welcome to the SPE podcast. I'm Asha Robles. For this episode, we are exploring the digital ecosystem and recent milestones in drilling and automation, among other topics. We'll be handing off the interviewing portion to SPE's VP of Communications, Glenda Smith. She caught up with Tommy Sigmundstedt, AUKR's VP VP of Drilling and Wells. This interview was recorded in March 2020 at the IADC SPE Drilling Conference. So with that background and introduction, here's Glenda Smith. I'm Glenda Smith and this is SPE Talks to Tommy Sigmundstedt. This is Glenda Smith, VP of Communications with the Society of Petroleum Engineers. During the IADC SPE Drilling Conference in Galveston, Texas, I caught up with Tommy Sigmundstedt, VP of Drilling and Wells at AUKR VP. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today, Tommy. It's a pleasure. You have a master's degree in petroleum engineering from Stavanger University. What led you to pursue petroleum engineering as a career? Well, being born in the 70s and from Stavanger, Norway, which is the old city, you know, the booming of the oil industry means something to us, as well as I had a lot of families in that business and they like big rigs, so the choice was easy. Lots of fun things to get into. Exactly. So during this morning's plenary session, you mentioned the importance of drilling and well construction as key parts of the value chain. Can you elaborate a bit on that for our listeners? Yeah, you know, the main purpose of drilling wells is to actually make the conduit from the reservoir up to the processing plant and maintaining it. And that in itself is, of course, necessary. But what we see now, at least if you operate in mature basins, is that the volumes get less and less and the cost of drilling normally has been going up. And for us to be successful and actually get access to these reserves economically, more of the cost lies into drilling because the reserves comes down. So that means that if we are not on top of our business, you know, we won't get access to those reserves. So that means that for us to be successful in the value chain to get the product to the market, we will be more and more essential in these more marginal businesses. And I'm sure that's part of what has led you to the innovative approach that you're taking to working with your drilling and service company contractors. Tell us how it works and a bit about the benefits you've achieved from this innovative approach. So alliances is part of our improvement agenda, which has four parts to it. It's the alliances, digitalisation, it's flexible business model and lean focus on flow efficiency. The way we go into this is the best company for the job. When we looked inside, we want fewer and deeper relationships with these companies. That means that if they're going to work with us for a long period of time, they need to think and the mindset and the focus need to be very similar to us. So that's actually what we look at more in addition to, of course, that they from a technical perspective can do the job is do they have the behaviour, the leadership and the culture that comes with this. And of course, over that period of time, we also need to look at different compensation models because they don't want to work for us if there's no money in it for them. Sure. So these are topics that we are discussing to try then to come up with how do we actually create tomorrow's value chain and how we're delivering wealth. That's great. I think you mentioned that you also have people in the same room working together, getting the data together, making decisions collectively. Yeah. So the end of last year, we opened what we call the onshore collaboration centre where everybody in our CBP is supporting drilling and waste post drillers, subsurface exploration, but also alliance partners sit in the same room getting data in. And that's where we have what I call a culmination of these four improvement areas coming together. You get the data in and it's visualised and you make a decision based on it. The people in the room, as I said, is alliances and our business partners within ARCA VP. We're looking at flow efficiency, but also part of lean is that you become very good at learning. You know, these teams normally were scattered maybe all over the building and hardly saw each other. Maybe if you're lucky, you get a one page of a lesson learned and maybe from a place that picked up lessons learned. And now, you know, competition, but learning goes really fast. So you're talking hours, maybe minutes before the other teams have picked up any good learnings. And of course then we do the data, the visualisation, the learning, write people in there, focus on being best at what you're doing. You make better decisions. We're listening to the SPE podcast. We will return to Glenda and Tommy's discussion in just a moment. First, we wanted to remind you about SPE's online education resource. Whether you prefer live or on demand training, join our industry experts as they explore solutions to real problems and discuss trending topics. Take yourself to greater depths right from your desktop with SPE online education. Learn more at webevents.spe.org. Now let's rejoin the discussion and send it back to Glenda and Tommy. So one of the things that I know AcreBP is doing is working on really fully automating the drilling process. So tell me more about how you're going about this and what your motivation for that is. Yeah, so the automated drilling is actually just the end of it. What we start looking at is what we call the digital ecosystem, which is more the backbone of how we actually define the data to flow from one end to the other, but also in a circular way. So if you think about we started the reservoir, that's where the oil is, and you have a reservoir model. And based on that, you lift up your data and you do your well planning and you make something called a digital twin. The digital twin is then broken down in work orders that is programming drilling machines. As you're drilling, that will create real time data, which will not only update the drilling plan, but also go back and update the subsurface, which again will update the drilling program. So it's a circular thing. But what you will achieve with automated drilling is of course, you will increase the quality of your delivery, you will come down on your non-productive time, you will reduce errors. You could probably drill cheaper. And again, back to what I said initially about cheaper wells into smaller pools of oil, makes resources that today maybe is not economic to develop actually, possible to get to the market. That's wonderful. So as a result of this work, you've achieved some amazing milestones in terms of your drilling efficiency. Tell us a little more about this. Yeah, we're proud of it. You know, what I'm most proud of is actually that it's not one or two rigs, it's all of them. Oh, that's great. And the portfolios, that tells me we've done something systematically. I think we're first in the focus we've had on creating the environment where actually say you want to be the best in living it is actually allowed to do. But within certain frames, of course, we're doing this systematically and in a conscious way. But we've just started. We haven't done much on digitalization yet. But you know, through alliances and the focus on lean by visualizing progress, visualizing that people actually can pick up learning from elsewhere, setting yourself a target and go after it. But not only setting the target, but detailed planning, which you go we are today, both with the record drilling within 24 hours or reaching a nautic mile in 13 hours and 38 minutes, which is one of the records. So you drilled a mile in 13 hours, nautic mile 1600 meters, whatever it is. Wow. Wow. That's pretty amazing. The 12 and a quarter. Yes, it is. That's absolutely amazing. So is there anything else about your drilling innovations you'd like to share with us? Well, it's all around the improvement agendas. But you know, we looked at it very simple. So we said able to deliver this high effect, highly effective rigs. So we picked the top of the shelf rigs. We've been focusing on what I call effective well designs. So one thing is they are robust, but also easy to implement. I put a lot of focus on our people, fantastic people with the right mindset, the right behavior that actually want to win. And as we discussed the collaboration, not only between drilling and wells and subsurface, but within alliance partner, creating that arena where they can cooperate and make decisions together. That sounds like a wonderful way to make progress. So you mentioned bringing together the right team. For young people coming into the industry, I think a lot of people perceive that drilling is, excuse the term, for old white guys, and not for young people and not for women. But do you think specializing in drilling and well construction is a good career choice for people choosing the industry? Yeah, absolutely. In terms of new technology, as I said, you work in the cool stuff, the big stuff, but actually through a digital way. And I would love to have more females in the industry. Actually, my first job as a drilling superintendent, I had about 50% females and 50% males. And this was the best team ever. Really, really getting after performance. You get that kind of diversity in there, it will just make you become better. But a lot, as you say, I think young people think about drilling as a land rig in the 50s. But actually, the joysticks, the cyber rigs we have today, the digitalization coming in, robots, it's just going to be fantastic. And the opportunity there as in another industry that you can compare yourself against. I was going to say that the use of joysticks in drilling, people whose parents said they were wasting time playing video games, they're going to discover that perhaps there was a career in that after all. Yeah, maybe, maybe. So thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. I hope that our listeners have learned a little bit about what you're doing and we'll look forward to hearing more about the innovations that you guys are making. Thank you. Thank you. That was SPE VP of Communications, Glenda Smith, hosting a discussion with Tommy Sigmundsted, addressing the technology advancements in drilling. Looking for the latest episodes?

"SPE President's Podcast with Terry Palisch: ""Creating Our Energy Future"" - How Members Can Help Improve The Industry's Public Image - April 2024","Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the February 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future, the value of publishing technical papers for your career. And now your moderator, SPE Senior Editorial Operations Manager, Brian Hibbard. Hello, I'm Brian Hibbard, Senior Editorial Operations Manager for SPE. I'm pleased to join 2024 President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast episode. This month, Terry will continue his discussion about the ways we connect our members to technology by focusing on SPE papers, JPT journals, and other SPE publications. Terry, thank you for inviting me to join you on this topic. Well, good morning, Brian, and thank you for joining me. I really appreciate you taking the time to be the host. I thought you'd make a good host for this topic. So thanks for taking the time. In December, we talked a little bit about regional sections and how I think that they are really the face of SPE and how a lot of people think of regional sections as, you know, when they think of SPE, they think of that. And I think SP papers, JPT, our journals is the same, is in the same boat of that. They're really some of the key aspects of being an SP member, reading the papers or writing papers, reading their JPT. But as you mentioned in the opening, it's also friend-centered to our mission statement, particularly the connecting our members to technology. It's one of the primary ways we do that. But it also plays a role in connecting our members to other members. So I thought it would be important to spend this month talking about the importance of papers, the JPT, and really continuing our focus on how members can get the most out of their SP membership and of course, in turn, create their energy future. Great. Yeah. SP papers mean a lot to me. I manage the journals as well as the conference papers here at SPE. And I know they are very special for you as well. When we did our How to Write a Good Abstract Podcast, or not podcast webinar together a couple of months ago, we got to hear a lot about your opinions and how to write a great abstract. So why do you think SP papers are so important? Well, let me just tell you a quick story. I mean, to just illustrate how important they are. So when I was a member of the Dallas section several years ago, before I had become chair and everything, with the education chair, Danny Bell asked me, he knew I'd written a bunch of papers. And he thought that, and his committee thought that writing papers were very important. So they actually asked me to put on a little webinar, or not webinar, but actually a seminar on how to write SP papers. And that's actually led to the webinar that you were just talking about, about writing an abstract. So, you know, I think it's very important. You know, if you think about technical papers, engineers in all industries write technical papers, they do it to disseminate information, they do it to memorialize their ideas, their discoveries, things like that. So it's important to any profession that we write and document. But, you know, when it comes to SPE, I say that I think they're critical to SP. You know, without them, we don't have conferences. We don't have symposia. They're a critical part of that. Of course, they enrich our SP library, which is of course, OnePetro, our online library. But again, in the end, it's the way we disseminate technology and information to our members. But it's also important to authors. And I think it's sometimes important that authors understand why it's important to them, because they have to do the heavy lifting. They are the ones who have to do the writing. Sometimes they have to do it in their off time. And I, in my webinar, you know, you can get more information on it. But you know, I talk about exposure. You know, if you write a paper, you get exposure. My 50 plus papers have been downloaded over 50,000 times. They have longevity. Of course, it goes in OnePetro and stays there forever. One of my oldest papers, the one I wrote in 1994, actually is still being downloaded periodically. So you have longevity. And then of course, your reputation. I can see that some of my papers have been cited over 100 times. But, you know, in the end, I think it's our professional obligation to the society and to others in our industry, because, you know, it helps our industry advance as a whole. One other thing I do want to point out, because a lot of people talk about, you know, maybe their company either does or doesn't encourage them to write papers. But it's also important to your company to get exposure, whether you're a service company or supply company, and you can help show the benefits of your products, or it's an operator or an oil and gas company where you get to increase your exposure and your reputation, and maybe it allows you to hire some good and talented people. So it's all, it's just really important, I think, for people to be involved in writing papers. Wade Johnson Great. For those who have not been involved with our technical papers before, can you explain what the process for writing SP paper is? David Morgan Yeah, let me just point out a couple of brief things, because again, I do spend a lot of time talking about this in that webinar, and I would like to point people to that if you want more information. But there's really two primary ways to get a paper written and into the SP system or one petro. And most of us understand the traditional way, you know, that's through an SP conference or symposium. You'll recall from our My November podcast, we talked a bit about conferences, or we hold SP has 35 to 40 of them every year. Each one of those has papers associated with them. So you go to sp.org, look at the events calendar, find the conference you like, send in your abstract, of course, make sure that you can travel to that conference, make sure that you can write the paper. But the selection committee goes ahead and selects, you write the paper, you present the paper, which of course is important to present it. And then it goes into one petro. The other one that a lot of people don't as familiar with, though, is that you can actually write the entire paper and submit it directly to peer review. So it's direct to peer, which means the it goes through the peer review process, and it gets accepted or rejected as a paper as a whole. If it's accepted, of course, it's then published in the SP journal and goes into one petro. I would like to point out, though, that conference papers can also go through peer review. Maybe we'll talk about that next. But if you want your paper to go into the journal, then you send it into peer review as well. So I'd say right now, I think my understanding on the numbers is about 60% of the submissions to the journals come from direct peer. And I think about 40% come from conference papers. Great. Tell us more about one petro as well as peer review in the journals. Well, one petro was established as one petro in 2007. We had about 60,000 documents. One petro is actually the repository then for all of our SP papers and other items. Today, there's over 1.2 million searchable items from all sources. And when I say all sources, what I mean by that is we, we, SP manages one petro, but we also have other member societies and publishing partners. So things like ARMA, Rock Mechanics Association, or SEG, SPEE, OTC, all of those entities also have their papers and their items in one petro as well. One petro has, is a hugely popular site. We get about 900 visitors every hour, millions of views every year. About 5,000 papers, SP papers go into one petro each year out of thousands of abstracts. So the peer review process then is the way you get papers submitted and published into a journal. It's a very rigorous process. I've had, I've sent in probably about a dozen of my papers to peer review from a conference and I've had about half of them make it through. So it is rigorous. You usually have to do a fair amount of editing. And I'd say, I think the number is about 400 papers actually make it to peer review through peer review, excuse me, and into the journal every year. So it's very selective. I think if you do the numbers out of all the abstracts that are submitted, if you, it ends up being about 5% of all abstracts actually make it all the way into a journal. So if you look at how many are actually sent to the journal, papers only about a third of them. So it's very selective. The SP journal itself, which is then the journal where those papers will go, was first published in 1961. It was actually followed by several separate journals. Most of you listeners remember them. There were major disciplines like drilling and completion journal, the production operations journal, and so on. Last year, SPE made the decision or about a year and a half ago to suspend the four journals that we had at the time and combine them all into the SPE journal. It was important to do so. A lot of people were asking for this. It really makes the SP journal more prestigious. So each of those, the SP journal now has sections in it. It'll have sections for the drilling and completions, production operations, all those former journals. So the journal itself will be a larger copy. So you still have the same number of papers from the individuals. But what it does is it makes that SP journal more prestigious and it also helps improve the impact factor, which is something that's very important, particularly to academia and people who are concerned about impact factors of the journals in which they're being published in. I do want to point out one other thing. You didn't ask this, but we also have five magazines in addition to the SP journal. Magazines are things like the way ahead for young professionals. The only gas facilities, JPT, things like that. Authors can also submit papers or ideas for papers or case histories or maybe feature articles and guest editorials to those magazines if they want to be published as well. Great. So you mentioned impact factors and serving academia. What if you could explain about open access, which is a newer topic, and do authors have an option to publish open access with SP? Yeah, that's a good question, Brian. It's something I didn't really quite understand until I was on the board several years ago and we were dealing with this. So the way it works is traditional subscription-based publishing is where the reader pays for access to the document. So the publisher, like in our case, SP holds the copyright. There's no charge for getting the paper into the system or one petro, but then if you want to download it, you have to pay for it. Or if you're a member, for example, you get 10 free downloads or maybe your company has a bulk download, things like that. That's traditionally how most journals or papers work in other platforms. However, over the last several years, there's a concept that has now become more popular and that is something called open access. In this case, the author actually pays upfront to retain the copyright and then the paper can be downloaded for free from the platform, like in our case, one petro. I mentioned this before, but in many cases, this is really important to academia because they want their papers to have high impact factors. So you want them to be downloaded. So open access also is mandated by some countries and some institutions, especially in Europe as well. So it was important to provide this type of opportunity. So last year in 2022, two years ago, SP instituted what we call hybrid open access. And what that means is you can follow the traditional route, submit your paper to one petro, no charge, and let people download it for a charge, or you have the option to pay for open access. But in perspective, if you're a member and you want to put your paper into open access, it costs you $2,000 one-time fee and then people can download it for free. Or if you're a non-member, it's 2,500. So that's kind of how open access works. And yes, we do have a hybrid option at SPE to do that. Mad Fientist Thank you, Terry. You talked about our magazines earlier. How do those fit in? And I also noticed that there's papers that are published in these magazines as well. Can you explain more about magazines? Terry Hayes Yeah, a lot of those magazines, as I mentioned before, are targeted to specific areas. So like, the way ahead is for young professionals. They curate material from existing papers. They may curate material from guest editorials, things like that. And it goes for all the others. One I'd probably like to key on would be JPT, the Journal of Petroleum Technology. JPT, of course, is our flagship publication of SPE. It actually was first begun in 1949. So it was begun actually before SPE became an entity. It started with the petroleum branch of AIME, of course, our precursor. So of course, if it's 1949, then that makes this year actually the 75th anniversary for JPT. So JPT has been around for a long time. It's been a huge success for SPE now. It was originally established with the goal of being the dominant industry publication, of course, and they wanted something that would be respected by industry. And I think, quite frankly, they've accomplished that. I mean, for most people, JPT is kind of like the Bible for them for oil and gas and source of information in our industry. I do have a little side note. The first edition in 1949 had four papers in it. Two of them I think you will find kind of interesting. So one of them was called A Hydraulic Process for Increasing the Productivity of Wells. It was J.B. Clark's paper that actually introduced the birth of hydraulic fracturing. So that happened in the late 40s. Another paper in there was called the Middle Eastern Oil and its Importance to the World. So I think about today and how fitting that is. I mean, the first publication of JPT actually highlighted two extremely important topics today, hydraulic fracturing and what it's done for the world supply and also then, of course, the importance of the Middle East to the world supply of oil. So JPT is available only to members. It is our publication. Of course, it's now a digital publication. We went digital after COVID as a cost saving measure and then we instituted it finally as always digital, if you will. And we did that because not just cost, but there was a lot of members who said, look, we just really shouldn't be printing anymore. We should be doing this digitally. It's been environmentally conscious. And quite frankly, there were a lot of JPTs that were going and being returned. They were going into bins. So it was just the right thing to do. It still comes in a downloadable PDF format if you want it. So if you want to print it out and read it, you can do that. But because it's digital now, we get 2 million page views every year at JPT. So it's wildly popular, almost 10,000 followers on LinkedIn. But the important thing is JPT contains articles that are written by staff. So we have on staff editors. Typically, they're going to conferences and listening to papers and listening to workshops. And they're writing articles about really what's cutting edge technology. So by reading JPT, you get to stay up on what's on the horizon, the hot topics. There may be paper summaries in there. Typically, those are done on their own. There's no peer review for it. They just summarize the paper. Or they may summarize a conference, things like that. The other thing is, since JPT is our primary source of information for our members, it also contains information. So things like member awards, people who've gotten awards. Maybe, of course, it has a section on who have passed away from our membership and other items of interest to the membership. And of course, if you're reading this column, not listening to it, but if you're reading my column, you're actually reading it in JPT. So that's another part, of course, of JPT, the transcript of this podcast. Trey Lockerbie So we've talked a lot about the benefits of writing papers. And I know you've written or co-authored over 50 papers. How has that benefited you personally? David Morgan Well, quite frankly, the first papers I ever wrote were when I was at ARCO. And the reason I wrote my very first paper was because I wanted to attend an SP conference. And at ARCO, you either had to kind of wait your turn rotation, or you wrote a paper. And so a colleague of mine and I wrote a paper. We attended the conference. And actually, it was really cool. I was hooked when I saw you see your name on a paper, you see your name in the program. Of course, you go through the stress of presenting the paper. But it's a sense of accomplishment. But, you know, eventually, when I got to Carbo, it was, of course, an important aspect of my job to write articles and papers about technical information to the industry, field trials, and disseminate information that way. But as far as how it's benefited me, I'll tell you a little secret, which it won't be after I say this. But my very first evaluation when I was at ARCO, my first year, I was told by my supervisor that I had very poor technical writing skills, and my presenting skills were terrible, and that I really need to work on that. So I won't say that I started writing papers to improve that. But I can improve that. But I can tell you that writing papers and presenting those papers have improved my technical writing skills dramatically. And I would hope that that supervisor now would look at my writing skills and say, Okay, you've got this a bit better figured out. But whether it's writing the papers, or working with others to write papers, or making the presentations or defending them in front of a crowd, of course, that sometimes is pretty stressful for people. But, you know, as you do that, it helps you personally, it helps you grow, and it's helped me grow. And frankly, it's been a huge boost to my career here at Carbo, particularly, but also my career at SPE. I have no doubt that if I hadn't started writing papers and making presentations that I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today. Well, Terry, your theme, again, it's to help the members understand how they can get the most out of their membership. Can you summarize how members can use conference papers, journals, and JPT to their benefit? Yeah, that's a really good question, Brian, I appreciate you asking that, you know, I've talked about this in the past, I think that there's really four critical steps to furthering your professional development. One is learning, another participating, volunteering and leading. In my view, papers, the journals, JPT, you know, these all provide us opportunities to learn and participate in particular. We get to learn and stay current on our technologies by reading SP papers, whether it's on OnePetro or via the journals, as well as, you know, just staying current in what's going on in our industry by reading JPT. You know, I've heard several influential people in the industry talk about how, you know, they always have a paper on their desk, or in the queue that they're reading, so that they're always learning. So of course, I think it's obvious how you can stay up to date and connect with technology and help yourself that way. But let's also not forget the participation part. You know, you participate by writing papers. As I mentioned before, for me personally, it increases your exposure to others in the industry. It helps you hone your writing skills. It helps you hone your presentation skills. And ultimately, by the way, let's not forget, it helps you expand your network. You get to meet a global community. You get to meet the session chairs. You get to meet the other co-authors. You get to meet the people who come up to you after you've made that presentation of the paper, and they ask you questions, and they give you your card. The other participation, I think I want to just point out one thing we didn't mention, is that you can also be a technical editor or reviewer. So again, peer review is done by volunteers. Volunteer members are the ones who read the peer review papers and provide feedback to authors. So we have hundreds of reviewers, but those technical editors, they're critical to the process as well. So that's another opportunity for you to participate and further your career. So, you know, I like to use the analogy of the gym membership. The more you put into it, the more you get out of it. And SP membership, again, is the same way. I think one of the key ways to do that, of course, is reading and writing and presenting papers. Of course, staying up to date with what's going on in the industry by reading JPT. And, you know, hopefully the more you do that, the more you'll develop professionally, and ultimately you'll continue to create your energy future. Trey Lockerbie Well, Terry, it's been great to talk to you today. What are you planning to talk about next month? Terry Hayes Well, Brian, let me just say thank you for hosting. You've done a great job and I really appreciate it. Let me just make a quick reminder. So nominations for the international awards closes in two weeks. So on February 15th, those nominations close and then for regional awards, they close at the end of the month, end of February. So make sure you get your well-deserving colleagues nominated so that they can be recognized at our awards banquets and awards banquets around the world. As for next month, I think we're going to cover how members can use SP to grow their expertise or to continue to grow their expertise. And I think we'll dive into a few different things, things like the Energy Stream, maybe touch on Petro Wiki and webinars, and probably talk a little bit about the distinguished lecturers and how important they are. It'll also be after our recent board meeting, so I may get a little recap on the board meeting. But, you know, as always, look, I hope that these podcasts are helping everyone find ways to, again, get the most out of their SP membership and create their energy future. Thank you. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the SPE Presidents Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts, on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org. you"
"SPE President's Podcast with Terry Palisch: ""Creating Our Energy Future"" -  August 2024","I'm Glenda Smith and this is SPE Talks to Scott Tinker. This is Glenda Smith, VP of Communications with the Society of Petroleum Engineers. During the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Duran, Saudi Arabia in January, I caught up with Scott Tinker. Scott is Director of the Bureau of Economic Geology with the University of Texas at Austin and the State Geologist of the State of Texas. Thank you for taking the time to visit with us today, Scott. I'm glad to be here, Glenda. How did you get interested in geology and geological science? Well, it was kind of one of these resistances, feudal things. My grandfather was a naturalist. My dad was a geologist with Shell for 39 years. And I went to university to be anything but a geologist. When I met the head of the geology program at Trinity when I started, he said, hey, take my intro class. I did and I was hooked. So it's been in the family. My son's a geologist, works with Hill Corps. So we've got four generations. You do a weekly broadcast called Earth Date. I hear it on a local radio station. Please tell our listeners about the purpose of Earth Date and how you choose the topics you cover. Do you hear it on a local station? I do. Where do you live? I do, in Dallas. Really? That's fantastic. Actually, Earth Date is now in 400 stations nationwide, all 50 states and three countries. I don't know if you've ever heard a show called Star Date on NPR, but I've been listening to that for years and years and they talk about the universe. And I thought we need to do an Earth Date. So I hired a researcher, Julie Hennings, and then the guy that I have done all the switch things with to take her research and turn it into a script. And then Harry and I go back and forth on the scripts and produce this very short minute and a half weekly broadcast. And we've passed 100 episodes now. It's been fantastic. But it's trying to bring stories of the Earth, but not just rocks. It's not geologic stories, but all kinds of stories about the Earth to listeners of a variety of ages. So we simplify things, but they're all peer reviewed and fact checked. It's rigorous science, stories that we've heard about or listened to and filtered through. It's just a lot of fun and it's become very popular. All the research is on the website. So you can see the script, all the background research and some of the photo imagery and the references that we use. It's a lot of fun. Amazing. When I first heard it, I was like, Scott Tinker, that's interesting. I find them interesting little bits. I hear them on the radio. They're kind of like, they're very short little podcasts, if you will, a minute and a half and produced. We go into a recording studio and I read 13 of them every quarter. But it's a lot of fun. I assumed that part of the reason for that was educating young people. And I know that's something you've always been passionate about. So where does the passion for education come from? That's about the level I understand things. So it was a natural. I don't want to go too much deeper than that. Actually kids are probably, they ask the most difficult questions because they're unabashed. They're uninhibited. They say, well, why is that? And you have to think about first principles. Why is that? Why do I believe that? My grandfather was an educator, high school principal. My mom taught for a year or two before she got married. And I've just always had an interest in short courses when I was in the industry and the profession and then now working with students. I taught in the classroom for a little while at UT, but I travel every week somewhere. So now I'm doing 50, 60, sometimes 70. Keynoter invited lectures a year somewhere in the world. I think of that as my education. And teaching, teaching is a multi-directional process. I find it really fun, particularly during the Q&A or the discussion, because that's when I begin to learn what's on their minds and I learn new things. So that, I think that's where my passion comes from is just that engagement and it lets me learn as I go. That's awesome. So people outside of Texas may have first become familiar with your name when you develop the movie Switch, which addressed our energy future. What inspired you to create that movie? I've been lecturing on energy for many years. And a documentary filmmaker named Harry Lynch made one of the first short format films on unconventional gas reservoirs in the Barnett. And he came, he was doing his research for that and came to interview me. So we did a little interview and he goes, boy, I've read all your stuff and looked at some of your background. Have you ever written a book? And I said, I'm too lazy to write a book. He goes, you want to make a movie? I said, well, what would that take? And he said, you can make a low level and mid and high level for this much money. And I said, let's do the big one. Unfortunately, that was about 2008, right before the big, the great recession, as we call it. But we did it. We made a lot of money throughout and we were filming in 2000, by 2009, 10, filming 11 countries. We did 50 interviews, 23 site visits, shot over 500 hours of film and then put that together into that 98 minute or whatever it is piece. A lot of fun. Energy was the star. And we were showing the pros and cons in a very objective way, nonpartisan way. Again, peer reviewed. People look at all that. Didn't understand at that time who our audiences would really be. But it ended up very interesting to the public in that. But it was the academic community that picked it up. It got into 50 countries, thousands of universities literally, and now high school and middle school campuses because we produce these short format one to three minute bits from Switch, made the Switch Energy Lab, the Primers and 101s, and have a 300 video library now on the SwitchOn.org website. And it continues to play. Professors and teachers will start a class with it and not just STEM. It's in business schools, policy schools, liberal arts and social sciences, because it introduces energy globally. Then you can start to talk about it in ways that we didn't expect. So that's the genesis. And Harry's a smart guy. I'm just a pretty face. He's way smarter than I am. And we have a lot of fun working together. So that's how it came about. And years later, we said, I continued to lecture. Harry went on and did a beautiful series on mental health as a documentary filmmaker. And I said, Harry, you know, we kind of left out a third of the world with Switch. We went where energy was or existed, and we left out the part where energy didn't exist. That's when I formed a 501Z3, and we really dove into the energy poverty story and then more broadly into high school pieces and a museum film and lots of other things we're doing now. Well, I know you've been finishing the sequels, SwitchOn, that deals with energy poverty. So I believe you said on your panel session at IPTC yesterday that it's now available. Literally this morning, I was sending final little tweaks, you know, take that phrase out or something like that. And the post-production or editing process is fascinating. It really is. We have a professional edit suite, sound design, color correction, original musical score, and things like that. It's really fun. So it's ready. We'll film on private screenings for corporations on campuses. We're taking it to some festivals, professional meetings. In fact, I talked to Mark Rubin, and I think we're going to try to do a screening at the next SPE in Denver in the fall. And then it'll have a limited theatrical, five or ten cities, major cities, where we go into movie theaters, and that allows movie reviewers and critics to see it and hopefully write stories in the papers. So that's distribution initially. We're building on a pretty good network from Switch still. We have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers from that. So it's a self-distribution plan. The power of that is we're not limited to a single network or to a single online, whether it's a Netflix or whatever. Now we can still put it there and might. But this gives us the ability to stream it from our own website to everyone who wants to see it and provide it essentially free. The corporate screenings will be asking for some contributions so that that'll help finance the campus and high school screenings. Sure. A lot of fun. Sure. So how will most people be able to see it when I'm assuming it'll be available in the next few months? Yeah, it's coming out. Like I said, the 29th of January it'll be finished and screening at Shell is going to be the first company to do a private screening. We're going to have a theatrical screening in Austin just for all the people that worked on it. We've rented a theater on February 9th. So anybody who wants to do a screening on their campus in a corporation at a local society meeting or a civic group, a scout troop, anything like that, you just go to a Switch On website, register very simply your name, the date you want it and how many you're going to show it to because we're going to try to capture and quantify the metrics. And then we send you a link and you can stream and screen it that way. And if that doesn't work then we'll send you a downloadable file. And for some places in the world, like I said, Switch went to over 50 countries. Some places don't have the bandwidth to stream. So they could download and then use it that way. But we're trying to capture rigorous metrics. It's fun on our website. We can show all the different countries that are hitting the website of Switch. It's remarkable, really, the people that want just nonpartisan objective energy information. I'm surprised really how hard that is to get to. I mean there are the IEA, EIA, BP, Shell, others put out neat energy statistics. But when you start looking at films or even podcasts or blogs, pretty quickly you can see the bias of whoever is presenting the information. It's hard not to be because energy impacts all of our lives in every way. It doesn't really work to be as objective and nonpartisan as we can, which means critical thinking, pros and cons, not always in agreement. Somebody might have a problem with this or with that because it doesn't agree necessarily with our own leanings. But that's okay. That's the group we're targeting. And it gives us the staying power. It stands the test of time. Switch was released in 2012. It's 2020. And it's still being screened in campuses all over the world for that reason. It's a little long in the tooth in a few places. And we've updated a lot of the short format video content on the SwitchOn.org website so that we can keep up. Because the energy world evolves. But it's something I'm passionate about, Harry's passionate about, and our small team is. So you've looked into the subject and fortunately in 2018 we fell below a billion people living in energy poverty without electricity. We still have nearly three million people who don't have access to clean cooking fuels. Yeah, three billion people. What will it take to eliminate energy poverty? Yeah. And those statistics are remarkable. The billion people without electricity, that's equivalent of three United States in population. We see about 2.5 to 2.7 on the cooking side. And that means cooking with biomass of some kind, wood or coal or dung inside the home. We feature that in SwitchOn in Nepal and go to a local hospital as well as visiting Sonakanchi in her home. And then look at the options to more modern fuels, which is largely LPG or biogas systems in the home or even induction electric cooktops and things that you can do that don't have to be a smoke. The particulates from cooking inside kill over three million people a year, which is more than malaria and AIDS combined. And who knew? And it's so solvable. Plus it leads to deforestation on a massive scale as people try to gather the firewood for heating and cooking inside. It's one of the leading causes of that actually. So there's a lot of ramifications. Eliminating it means education. It means teaching how to fish, not bringing fish so that we can have options and alternatives coming in and then in the local culture, the local community, the local political system, and they vary all over the world. And these can be adopted in ways that make sense for that community. It's not easy. Remarkably, I think our work and others show the leading disruptor to addressing this is corruption at all levels, senior government, mid-range and local leaders, and even in the where, A, you don't want them to have access because you start to get a light in the home. You can read at night, you get education, and then all the things that go along with that that are positive, health care, direct tie between education, lower fertility rates, big issues like immigration and migration. When you begin to create healthy economies, you don't necessarily want to leave or have to leave because of jobs or other forms of corruption. The rights and freedom of women. It's the women who are going to get the water cooking inside, not getting to go to the schools like the men do in many cultures. So there are huge issues, certainly health care, vaccines, refrigeration that go along with access to stable electricity that come along with this. So providing this sounds like a big challenge, and it is, but there are systems, whether it's in Nepal bringing natural gas from India as LPG, putting it, there's factories now creating the LNG canisters which get delivered on various systems to the homes, including right up to the end to a bicycle that I rode and took two canisters to a local home. And so it's there, even in some of the poorest economies in the world. Electricity, certainly in indigenous communities, off the grid, if you will, in rural areas, distributed renewables is the only way. Initially, there are no good roads, there are no pipelines, there are no wires. So you're bringing in probably mostly solar panels or pico hydro in rivers or small micro wind turbines, but mostly solar. The first thing people get when they get electricity in their home is, you may know this, but many don't, a cell phone. That's what they plug in. So the communication starts immediately and now all of a sudden there's a global awareness of what exists in the world. But then as you start to grow that demand in those indigenous communities, and that's the 900 million to a billion people start to scale some things up. We feature another thing in Switch On, we call it kind of under the grid. This is the slums, which have tremendous populations around the world. As people move to cities, you're looking at hundreds of millions of people moving to cities every year globally today. And mostly they go to very poor parts of those cities. So under the grid means there's wires there, but you can't afford it or get access to them. We feature Kibra, which is the largest slum in Africa outside Nairobi and Kenya. And look at the challenges there, which include the corruption. Kenya Power brought in the electricity using tokens and cell phones, so creating credit in commerce to buy it. And then the cartel that runs the slum, like they do all over the world, said, great, we'll tap in illegally around those and wire them up and charge a little bit less money. Only the problem is they don't know what grounding is. It's all corrugated metal. So when it rains, there are cats and dogs and children and people dying of electrocution all the time. So you'll see us talk about this in that section of the film. So the whole challenge of that. And then, of course, the clean cooking is another area that we feature. So, but they're all solvable. And I think I love to focus on the radical middle, which is where you bring energy in the economy and the environment together and try to address some of these very tough social problems with science and engineering and economics, as well as social solutions, policy and regulation appropriately. But it's really challenging space because everybody has their own biases. But this sits right there. And I think this is one of those areas that everybody can get their heads around. If we end deforestation, the practice of it and plant those trees back, it helps with CO2 uptake and climate change. And then we bring in clean fuels and it helps with energy poverty. And you start to create the micro markets where somebody is now selling an induction cooktop or they're selling LPG. And it's the women who lead those micro markets. The research shows that they'll invest back in the community three times more than the men will. What a shock. And so you can start to see different groups that would come together around this. If we could just let go the idea, some would resist. Well, it's natural gas and that's a fossil fuel. That's terrible. Well, it doesn't have sulfur and nitrogen and particulates and mercury and the things that coal or woods do. So it's much better for indoor cooking. And you can distribute it. Yeah, it's a hydrogen fuel. Not the N-carbon or four hydrogens, but let's get over that. Or some might on the other side might resist. Well, let's bring a natural gas power plant or a coal power plant or a nuclear reactor. Well, no, this is not that. It might be in a decade or two decades, but it's not that. So how do we facilitate that? And mostly it's going to be creating from the bottom up the community structures that let we say empower the people to empower the people to empower themselves. And that's how this will work so that the local leaders can be part of it, but not in the way of it. I think industry and governments and academics can work together in this space. And it's common space. It's something that have benefits for all of us. Win, win, win. Yeah, it sounds like it. And certainly a great way that we can affect what's happening in the world with just small efforts, just little things that snowball. Right. And again, it's not aid. It's bringing the tools for the communities themselves to sustain the process. So when we in switch, we brought first solar to an indigenous community in Columbia, the Arhuaco village of Luchuqua on the Venezuelan border. Eight days, brought a small team, young people, our film crew, and they invited us a year earlier and we literally paid for and brought everything from all over the world. So we'll feature the transportation that was required to get solar panels, wires, the battery and install this over these eight days in mud huts at that truce, a three and a half kilowatt array. It's half what you'd put on your home. Okay. But seven mud huts with that truce with light, three with one, three ceiling fans in the community hut and one refrigerator freezer. That's what we accomplished. And these indigenous people who had not really seen each other before at night, other than over a fire when they go into the town, but in their own villages, it's remarkable. You'll this story comes and goes throughout switch on. But that's how and we didn't, we couldn't bring hydro. They didn't say the river was sacred that runs through town. They didn't want wind. It was only solar. They have a very specific requirement for that set of things. But again, this is how it happens, but it's going to take effort. But in the end, my wife and I bought the battery. These are expensive. These are big lead acid battery stack. It's 10 to $15,000. They agreed to replace that battery in eight to 10 years. So they are selling popsicles from the refrigerator and keeping the money. And the village will pay for the. So this is the sustainability piece, their own battery replacement. And the panels, the frames will be good, but the panels are probably a 20 to 30 year lifespan. It's the challenge with any form of energy. I go off topic here a little bit, but what I'm describing is the sun that's renewable, but panels and batteries aren't renewable. You have to mine them. You manufacture them. You deliver them through transportation and then you have to replace them and do it again. So it's not renewable. It's just a different kind of infrastructure to collect a different kind of energy. But all of that has environmental challenges. All of it. Where are the batteries going to go when they wear out? We hope they will take them and recycle them properly. Where are the panels going to go when they wear out? They eventually end up at landfill. So there's nothing that, no silver bullets. Nothing comes without cost. But that sustainability in Nepal, selling these induction cook stoves and then you see people starting to create little centers of access to food and cooking that isn't just in the home. You're listening to the SPE podcast. In this episode, VP of communications, Glenda Smith is talking to energy expert and storyteller Scott Tinker. We'll return to their conversation in just a moment. First, we wanted to invite you to experience the latest SPE publication, Data Science and Digital Engineering in Upstream Oil and Gas. This week, hybrid machine learning is explained in non-technical terms and a new supercomputer is claiming to be the most powerful in the world. Visit DSDE online. A link is in the show notes of this episode. Now let's get back to the SPE podcast. This week, we're talking to Scott Tinker about his travels. In Ethiopia, you see on the street now sewing machines that are run with electricity. When we went to Ethiopia and Vietnam, the way they're addressing energy poverty is on a much different scale. Not the Maasai, but in the cities, Arasabua and others, and in Vietnam. In Ethiopia, they are building the GERB. It's called the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. It's three times the size of our Hoover Dam. It's on the blue Nile branch of the Nile, which flows north and merges with the white Nile into Cairo, Egypt. It's right on the Sudanese border. We flew out there, spent some days, and you can't imagine the size of this. It's about two-thirds of the way complete, a multi-multi-billion dollar project paid for by Ethiopia. Each Ethiopian citizen gives a month of their salary to this project. It's national pride. Because Cairo threatened to bomb it because it's on the Nile. And by colonial law, Egypt had rights to the Nile, and Ethiopia said, well, maybe not. Maybe this is our headwaters. So now it's changed the balance of power in North Africa, and they're at the table having conversations. This dam is a 6.4 gigawatt. There are 16 400 megawatt turbines. So that's like six nuclear reactors, 10 coal power plants. 10,000 wind turbines, two megawatt each. So you start to think about scale and environmental impact. It will provide electricity to about half the country. That's 50 million people, and they'll be able to sell some of the local countries and bring in revenue as well. So this is a whole different solution for energy poverty. Vietnam is further along. They are now competing with China and other Southeast Asian countries to manufacture stuff that you and I buy. We get everything from Southeast Asia now. They're going to solve this. They built all their hydro. It's a long, narrow country, 1,100 mile or so jungle Vietnam. So wind and solar is really not possible. They're not going to cut down jungle. So they're going to do it with coal power plants. They're building 50 new 400 megawatt coal power plants. And you say, coal, are you kidding? Well, no, it's affordable. It's available to them. They have their own coal resource and trains. We go into a mine. We go out on the barges. We go to the coal power plant. We go into the community throughout Switch On. And it's reliable. So, you know, they don't like the particulates and the air pollution that comes along with burning coal, but the jobs, the stable electricity. I ask them, have you always had electricity in your home? And they laugh and they say, of course we have. You know, we're not their equivalent word. We're not hicks. We're not country bumpkins. And when I ask that around the world, other places, oh, no, we've never had electricity in our home. This is new. So Vietnam is further along, but they needed to go to that next level. We went in and we filmed inside a massive garment manufacturing plant that makes over a hundred name brands that you and I buy. Shirts and suits, 300 sewing machines by hand. Workers. Amazing. We don't sew that in Switch. We're going to, that'll be in our third film. It won't be in Switch On. It'll be in Making the Switch. That's what happens when you go from severe poverty 25 years ago, now starting to grow. The demand for electricity goes up and you create commerce that you can sell something of value inside your own communities and to the world and create the wealth. And then pretty soon you go to a point where you can afford to invest in the environmental kinds of regulations and cleanup that we have. Clean air, clean water, clean soils. And that's, you got to go up this curve and then over some hump, depending on where you are to do that. And I don't think there's any way to circumvent that. There might be, but I haven't thought of it, you know, and I haven't read about it either. So we need to accelerate it. We need to accelerate the growth of the world so that we can all afford to invest in this. I just say as you were talking, I was thinking about some of the comments I've heard from people about the ability to be concerned about climate change as a first world problem. And yet I think you're right. We have to solve the third world problems so that they also then can get to the point that that becomes more important than the immediate need of, well, I need to be able to turn on the light and my children need to be able to do their homework and I need to be able to cook my food. And then you can get to those higher order problems. So as you start to provide energy, particularly to the lowest economic scale, you'll begin to see ability to adapt to things. And climate change is certainly one and the things that go along with that, particularly sea level rise and other challenges of warming. So you have to have energy, air conditioning, warming or cooling, severe cooling, which happens in places too. So heat and other things to adapt to a changing climate. But more than that, local air emissions, cleaning up the water, soil pollution, the worst environmental impacts in the world, and I've been fortunate, I've been to 65 countries, are where it's poor. They simply can't afford to invest in that challenge or you've got other problems. So you start to see with energy and the underpinning of economic growth, the ability to engage in the frameworks that allow us to address climate change and all sorts of other environmental impacts. So it's a virtuous cycle, but you have to have a certain level of wealth in order to be able to afford to do that. And again, accelerating to that is what's vital and hopefully accelerating with energy sources and strategies that are cleaner, if you will. And by that, I mean both atmospheric emissions, local air emissions, things we put in the soils and the waters clean to me and has to involve the four pillars. Okay. And nothing's perfect, whether it's mining or manufacturing or landfill disposal or emissions of some kind from combustion, nothing's perfect. And so that's the circle that goes on, the energy, the economy, the environment. That's the walls of the three E's. So switching to first world problems for a moment, as the leave it in the ground, Drumpy grows, certainly in Europe, increasingly in the U.S. How does the industry balance the need to provide power to the world with the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels? Well, the keep it in the ground, which has been around for quite some time. It has more formal policy names now in the U.S. and other places. But the genesis of that, I don't judge the intentions. Hey, fossil fuels are the problem. Let's leave them in the ground. Let me go to an analogy, though. To me, it's the equivalent of saying, hey, there's this thing I know that requires all sorts of fresh water and all sorts of chemical things to make it work. And then we have to dispose all this and it runs off into the rivers. It's an energy source. You say, what's that? I say, well, it's food. Okay. We have to have water and fertilizers and we deplete the soils and it runs off into rivers. But we're not going to end food. We're not going to end that source of energy, the calorie for our bodies. It's not the energy source. It's making agriculture better. It's not coal necessarily, or certainly oil, natural gas. They are fossil fuels. One's all carbon, one's carbon-hydrogen, one's mostly hydrogen. But it's how you make the process of producing that. It's a big thing. Producing the infrastructure to drill for and explore for oil, natural gas, moving it to where it needs to be, refining the products, moving them to where we use them, combusting them. There's a lot of environmental impact to that chain and we can do better along the way. We are and can do better. Again, wealth and regulation makes that better. Where it's done best is we're in the nations that regulate it the best. If we move that over to nations that aren't well regulated, use whatever terms you want for those, but lower income, different political and governance systems, arguably we're not helping the environment. The same product gets produced with lower regulations and you end up local air, land and water and the one global atmosphere emitting more for that unit of commerce than you would have in a regulated economy. So have we done good for the climate or not? I think I can argue very easily not. Now, 85% of the world's energy comes from fossil fuels still, coal, oil, natural gas. But if you throw in nuclear, you're approaching 90%. We're not going to end that in the world. That would be an environmental disaster. I didn't say an economic disaster. I said an environmental disaster because of the loop between the energy, the economy and the environment. I don't judge the intentions. I just think there's an education that has to go on about how to make this work better. Again, the other 10%, mostly hydro, but then a growing solar capacity, certainly wind has been growing in waves and tides and biomass. Biomass is a big part of that. Not renewable. I mean, it's renewable and you can grow it again, but biomass, burning biomass doesn't have helpful claim. Even though plants take it back up and you burn it, well, there's a lot of stuff in between. Cutting down the wood, turning your wood pellets, putting it on barges or trains, moving it to where it needs to be picked up and then burning it. This isn't a zero emissions. Process. But all those renewable energies that make up the other 10% or so have their own environmental challenges. I think energy honesty, energy integrity will allow us to address these challenges in a way that brings the thoughtful people from different sectors, industry, governments, academics, NGOs together and the public to say, hey, what can we do here in our part of the world? Everybody has different resources. Some have great sun, some have great wind, some have great oil and gas, some have uranium, thorium, waves and tides, geothermal, I haven't mentioned, but wherever that exists with your resources, how can you go about making the environmental impacts lower and still underpin your economy so that you can afford to continue to do that? That's sustainability to me. Sustainable energy future is one in which we lift the world from poverty and we address the environmental impacts of all forms of energy on all forms of the environment. That's sustainable. We've gotten a little myopic, I think, in our environmental focus. Positive side is with education and getting particularly young people who are so passionate and so smart and so engaged globally. We get those good minds involved in this on social media in a way that's, I'm going to call it a safe space and what that means to me is you're safe to say anything you want to say, not safe from not hearing something you don't want to hear, safe to say anything you want to say or think about so that good ideas all come to the table and they get filtered through your own approaches and we come out with some brilliant future solutions and again I think right now there's a lot of shaming that goes on on social media of anybody who talks about fossil fuels as part of the future solution and that's just, again, that's well intended but I think there's a lack of understanding of the role they play in creating the health that allows you to both clean them up and do many other good things in those communities to grow our total environmental"

Thank you. Now, let's begin our conversation. AI has been around for over five decades. And however, recently, just last year, OpenAI energizes this whole area with the release of chat GPT. And generative AI is seen as a key lever for value creation in energy sector. So let's explore different facets of this area. And I'm going to start with Mehdi first. You have extensive past experience in oil and gas. You have worked for you're working for a leading tech company. Does technology play a key role for AI? You know, what's what's propelling this AI momentum, in your opinion? Are there specific application areas for energy sector that has most value and what's challenging that needs to be addressed? Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Sushma, for the question. So working for AWS for over five years now, I've been exposed to a lot of ideas and customer use cases around AI and sometimes generative AI, you know, more recently. And based on my past experience, I've seen like three, four main areas that AI is helping customers to accelerate their innovation and be more productive. Right. And the good news is that everything that we have been doing using different techniques other than generative AI can be combined with with the power of generative AI to bring even more automation. So some of these areas that I've seen, I can talk about those, give you some examples. The first one is for increasing employee productivity, especially with generative AI. As you know, especially in upstream oil and gas data lives in silos, it's very hard for scientists and engineers to get their hands on the data that they need to do their analysis. So it's using something like generative AI. It's now very easy for customers to retrieve that information in a matter of seconds instead of weeks. That's the case today. And also, there are other areas that companies are seeing more productivity using AI technologies. And one example could be in processing seismic data. Right. You may know to get seismic from the acquisition stage to the final image of Earth, it typically takes about five to six months to do the whole process. Right. But using deep learning models for seismic interpretation and seismic data processing, now we are talking about a fraction of that time. Right. To get the same thing. And same applied for reservoir simulation. Sometimes a reservoir simulation job can take more than a week to run. But using deep learning techniques, again, we are now able to bypass the computationally expensive CFD simulations and get the same results in the matter of minutes. The second area that I've seen customers benefit from AI is by reducing their operational costs. One big item there that comes to mind is predictive maintenance. If you take like offshore environment as an example, right, an incident in an offshore setup could mean loss of about 20 million dollars. So one of the use cases we have had is that a customer was trying to use reinforcement training to find the optimal set points for artificial lift operations to reduce the amount of interventions, which means loss of revenue. And also improving supply chain operations, where time series forecasting, which is again a deep learning approach, plays a huge role in accelerating the supply chain. And the third area that I've seen customers use AI to be more productive and bringing more safety to their workers is things like corrosion detection, right, where some customers have used computer vision to automate the inspection of corrosion. And again, if you take the offshore environment as an example, it's very dangerous to send people over to do the inspection visually. So if you have a computer vision model mounted on a drone, you can automate the whole process without needing to send people to the site. And also another example is about detecting personal protective equipment. Sometimes workers are required for safety reasons to wear, for instance, hard hats or gloves or glasses. And using computer vision techniques, you can kind of make sure that everybody's following the protocols and everybody's doing so. So these are just some of the examples. I'm happy to elaborate more if you have any questions. Great, Mehdi. Thanks. I think those are some very excellent and important areas. Let's further get some more insights from Feng on this. So Feng, what are your views about generative AI's role in the current business climate? And are AI's applications already valuable? I mean, is it seen as low hanging fruit with more to come or is it just a hype? And what particularly is exciting about this arena for you, both professionally and from an SPA perspective? So first of all, thank you, Sujima, for the opportunity for us to share our thoughts with the SPA audience. Like Mehdi mentioned, there are already lots of AI applications in the energy industry. In option where I have my most experience, I have seen AI applications for well placement, well spacing, completion design, artificial optimization, like you mentioned, there is one, and abnormal event detection during operations. AI workflows are particularly useful and unconventional because of the unique nature of the unconventional, a very complex petrophysics, geomechanics and free flow. And on the other hand, we have a high welcome and large amount of data that we can use to create AI models. And recently we presented at the SPA conferences about how we use AI to create a physics-based cycle model or pure data driven model and combine both to determine optimal completion intensity and well spacing horizontally and vertically to maximize the oil recovery. And what's more interesting in my view in the paper is how we incorporate domain knowledge in future engineering and the hydroclonic unit of that process of machine learning workflow. Now, we should recall physics-informed machine learning or physics-informed AI. In the recent context of a new journey of AI like CharGP and New Journey, we may wonder what more can we do? GEN-AI models are very large and more sophisticated and they activate some advanced capabilities able to achieve like 80 percentile performance in exams like SAP and JRE. And the recent news says it can pass with a 3.3 GPA in freshman year at Harvard. So it's amazing. So given our existing AI successes, what more can we do with GEN-AI? With GEN-AI, that is built for energy, for oil and gas and oxygen. So let's imagine a GEN-AI model that has been trained on all the SP papers and textbooks in engineering and geoscience. Such a GEN-AI model could present some very exciting news cases. For example, if one was to apply wheel performance analysis on a gas wheel, and this GEN-AI may script a Python code in a few seconds for the 4-chamber equation and analyze the data and even produce the visualization. Another example, if one wants to build a simulation model like INTERSEC for resource simulation or PADEX prosper for well simulation, and this GEN-AI model can search through the very, very large documentation of the software and provide relevant suggestions specific to your simulation objectivity. So these are just examples of the day-to-day technical work we do in project design and operations supporting the option. So with GEN-AI, basically you would have engineering and geoscience co-pilot, your junior engineer or geoscience intern, to argument your capacity and capability. And in SPE, with this AI for energy initiative, our goal is to improve members' awareness and skills in the arena of AI, including GEN-AI through OpenCompeCity and Industry Conference. I'm so excited about the potential impact that we can make. Thank you, Feng. And again, definitely this is a very exciting and key area where we see a lot of investments and enthusiasm from business. So let's go to Joshua and further explore this. Joshua, the success of generative AI is dependent on various types of data inputs. The data quality, reliability is important along with training data. So would you share your thoughts on AI trends and data significance for AI success? Can AI outcomes be trusted by business? Thanks for the question. It is one of the most important questions, I think. Data quality is the most important feature of training and using generative AI, specifically a large language model. So you want to basically get the highest quality input for training that you can manage. So if you have a silo, you have a corpus, do everything you can to get clean output from that. And I know there are lots of different kinds of file types beyond the typical PDF. There's oil and gas specific file types, so you want to be able to handle those. We've seen like with Falcon, that particular model, it used what's called refined web, which was a web crawl corpus, crawling the web for data. And then it was refined to remove duplication, to remove bad text and stuff like that. And that helped produce a better model. So that's on the input side. On the output side, on the use side, you want, again, very high quality sources so that you can seed the large language model with content from your silos that allows you to ask questions or get insights about your own content. So I think a lot of us have seen this by now, that you can kind of provide the language model some context, like I want to answer the question about these particular sources and how those sources are found. That's going to be like a whole pipeline that's going to search for corpus. You also want to involve human oversight of the responses. So just like when you have a knowledge management system or like a community knowledge system where people are posting responses or questions, you want somebody that's kind of looking at this stuff to kind of clean it up or consolidate. And same thing with the outputs from large language models. You want people to be looking at this. I think an important thing to remember with all this is these models, while they seem so reasonable and sophisticated and they can argue their way to convince you of anything, they don't actually have a way of evaluating if they're doing an accurate job. Like if they're actually producing accurate responses about the world, right? So they don't have any connection to the world. They're only looking at their own training set in a sense. They're only looking at the probabilities of things they've been trained on. So they can't tell if the next word that they're producing is actually an accurate word about the world or just likely given the training that they've seen. So the pipeline really matters. Independent of the large language model, it's the stuff you feed in, not only during training, but during use. And it's the way you use the response that's going to make this thing more accurate and therefore more trusted. I think you need to teach staff to not just blindly trust whatever it says. And it's kind of like an information literacy. Maybe it's going to be in some AI literacy. How do we make sense of the outputs? And overall, I think just the general story is trust is earned. Trust in these models is earned. You can't just mandate it. So we're going to have to see in their use in practice, are we finding that we trust them? Excellent. I think you've hit the right points that trust has to be earned. And a lot of it depends on the kind of data that's been fed in. And its accessibility and reliability is very key. I've seen that was a key element that we focused on in Shell and also in my work with the current icon where we bring the data. And that's used by the engineers and geoscientists because that is kind of the foundation of the decision making and going forward. I quickly want to follow up with Feng about, should business strategy include AI focus? My answer is yes, because the focus will help us figure out how to use AI, to transform our organization's abilities in all areas in my view. Data retrieval and employee tuning, technology development and workflow automation. So take an SBE organization, for example, as a publisher, a specific strategic question we may ask ourselves is, should we anticipate a time when members prefer using AI power tools to find answers directly instead of downloading papers individually and reading them page by page? So this is pretty much like a in search versus traditional search engine question. So in fact, this data retrieval application is a low-hanging fruit for any company operating or service provider, any company that has a large internal database built by their employees over a period of time. So we should include AI focus in the strategy and figure out how do you use this? Thanks Feng. And again, strategy has to recognize AI as a big lever. The whole area of digitalization relies on this. I would remind the audience to please share your questions. We would like to have our speakers address any of those. And let me also follow up with a short another quick question to Mehdi, you know, about technology readiness. Can business change from its current ways to adopting AI more rapidly? Yes, absolutely. There are certain things that need to be in place, especially when we are talking about something like generative AI and the problems, potential problems that it has, hallucination and returning inaccurate information. The way to kind of take care of those issues and make sure that it's really returning useful information for companies is to have your data platform in place where you have ingested all of your information because those generic models that are available today through the internet. They have been trained on generic information from internet, right? They haven't seen companies private information and companies want those models to work for their specific projects and use cases, right? And the way to do it is through a process called fine tuning where we need to ingest and, you know, extract the information from documents. Sometimes they could be embedded in some images, spreadsheets, PowerPoints even we have seen with some customers, right? So it's important to be able to extract all of those properly in the right order and curate those information and feed it to the fine tuning process. So I think when talking about generative AI, that's the most important thing and, you know, currently the only solution to kind of make sure that those models return relevant information and are not just, you know, creating some general text from the internet, right? So I think to me that would be the biggest point. Great. Thanks for that, Mehdi. We have a question from LinkedIn by George Rosili Alice. Is explainable AI in which the input to an answer can be solved be the most applicable computing process for industry? So Joshua, you want to start with that and everybody can chime in. Yeah, thanks. I was thinking about this issue of explainability. So explainability, it's also known as XAI. It's not particularly new because it's been around since neural nets or symbolic or not symbolic, you know, like semantic processing. The reason it's been around since then is because neural nets have this kind of intrinsic property that you can't really read why it's doing what it's doing from the internal component. So if you're looking at your own brain neurons, you can't just monitor some of them and say this is what they're thinking about. Not yet anyway. I guess they're working on that. So I was at the grocery store recently and I was using, I brought all my items to this checkout and it used computer vision to look at the items. I just put them on the table. I noticed that I had then looked at the little display to see that it had all the correct items and it did. And so I said, OK, let's pay for it and I'm out. So it's very quick. AI was a great use case in that situation. But I noticed I validated, like I verified the AI's responses or its conclusions by looking at the list. And that was really convenient. Right. So if it wasn't right, I would have probably just scanned all the items myself and just said, forget this thing. So in that sense, I didn't need an explanation because I could quickly identify it was doing the right thing. And so when people are using like a large language model and it gets a response and they know that response makes perfect sense, they move on. If they don't know if it makes sense because they don't actually have like enough knowledge to really diagnose if that answer is correct or not, that's where you need the explanation. And so explanation still is important. It's not essential for every situation. If you can find situations where AI is used and it is obvious when the answer is right or wrong, it can simply be an efficiency gain. But if it's used for situations where people don't have the ability to know if it's right or wrong in all cases, that's where the explanation comes in. And we're working on techniques. These models today are better at it because they can give an English explanation, but there's still a lot of work to be done there. Thanks. We have another question about the validation strategy after fine tuning from Pushpesh. Is there any research on general framework for validation? And if either one of you want to comment on that? So maybe just a few. So the question is, what would you suggest as a good validation strategy for fine tuning after fine tuning? And is there a general standard framework? Well, there are certainly measures. A lot of these measures are related to the particular data sets that are used. So one can measure how well you match a data set. And there's like a wide range of these and they're well published. And the point of that is to know if this model is better than that model. So there's like leaderboards. But as far as your organization, you're probably going to have a particular kind of use case. So in some sense, there's not much replacement for the human feedback. You really need to know if this is working for people. And you need to know not just when you're training this thing, but after you've deployed it, because the world's going to change. Right. Terms come and go. Used like kind of documents in your corpus are going to be different over time. So you want to continually get feedback. Maybe it's just thumbs up, thumbs down, but you need to get feedback if this is still working. There's another technique that people use, which is to have another fancy language model, say like GPT. Check the answers of your internal model. So can it make sense of what your model produced as its answers? And so it's like language models evaluating language models. And that works pretty well, but it's really not the same as human feedback. So I think you always need to have instrumentation to see if the thing you've deployed is still working. Thanks. We have another question. I'll quickly put it on from Ahmed A. How can you deal with balance and data sets used for training as breakdowns are infrequent and unique? Would this not always take longer? So all of you can chip in or see if there's any thoughts on the training data. Mehdi, you want to comment on it? So, yes, based on our experience, even a tiny amount of data that you add to the fine tuning process, it helps really a lot. And unfortunately, the way to kind of evaluate the amount of improvement and Joshua talked about some of those aspects. To me, like A-B testing could be a very good solution for that, where you have a pool of users and then they give you feedback on the thumbs up, thumbs down. And that could be one way to kind of determine when you have enough data that you have used for your fine tuning process. And after some point, you can be confident that you have a very relevant and updated model. So that's, I think, a feasible solution for A-B testing. Great. And again, this is such an exciting topic. There's so much to be discussed and thought. But let's talk about the challenges and risks. And I would like each one of you to give a little thought about how should A-I-B effectively manage any elements of legal regulatory or other safeguards? If you would give your thoughts. Yeah, I mean, just a point on the data privacy because there might be a risk that employees could accidentally share intellectual properties and classified information. An example of this is a Samsung charging data. So now in charge, we can choose to save or not to save or charge history. But I believe organizations may be still asking to send their data to a server that is beyond their direct control. In my view, it's just a matter of time to have more secure A-I services or enterprise applications in the near future. I have something to add as well. Some wisdom I've received over time is when you're putting a new system out there and trying to get people to adopt it, they're suddenly going to think the system they already have is three times as good as they thought yesterday. And the new system is three times as worse as what you're trying to convince them of. So you basically need an order of magnitude improvement to get people to adopt something. So you want to find ways to work this change into their workflow. The other thing to consider is the cost of human labor, like in a sense, ethical costs as well as actual costs. So if you're asking people to probably produce part of your training set, which could be an extensive job, but also evaluate its responses, you want to work that in in a way that's kind of natural and not give people like the extremely tedious task of generating large training sets. So if you can make it part of the workflow where they're evaluating these systems and even generating new input for the next training round, that would be ideal. We are almost done with time, so I'm just going to conclude and say, you know, Medhi, Feng, Joshua, thank you all so much for your insights. And to our audience, thank you for joining us today.

SPE President‚Äôs Podcast with Terry Palisch: ‚ÄùCreating Our Energy Future‚Äù - January 2024,"This is SB Talks Tech with Trent Jacobs and Steve Rosenfest. Alright, so welcome to the SB podcast. Happy New Year. The January issue of JPT is out. And so our plan today was to talk a little bit about some of the reports inside. Amongst other things, we have a big feature on casing failures in horizontal wells written by yours truly. And then Steve, you took a dive into some of the differences between tier one and tier two assets in the US shale market. And then you also wrote a report about heavy oil innovation or rather the challenges that that sector faces with using new technology. So why don't we get started with your look at the ways that shale plays are ranked by the sector? Well, I guess in a way it's about looking at where's the value here and when's it worth it to spend money, when's it not. And this study by Deloitte Energy Consulting was really interesting because they looked at 35,000 actual wells in the Permian and the Eagleford. And they raised a lot of questions that I'm not saying are completely things we're thinking about, but put some numbers on things. I mean, ultimately what you're seeing is that it is what it is and it's not great. Well, but spell it out for me. Is there a difference between tier one and tier two? Well, no, actually, no. There's tier one, of course, was the these are both really large designations for those who haven't been following along at home. Tier one was supposed to be the good quality rock. It was the stuff, the best quality. Yeah, yeah, it was the stuff that was going to produce more than the lower quality tier two or three. Consider it's just like prime and choice stakes or something. The reality has been that when you looked at the charts, they produced other results from these things. You couldn't tell them apart. What's good and what's bad was about the same for me. The one right here too is not necessarily bad. It's just it's part of the lesser, the secondary on the bench here. And it was often talked about as if it really mattered, because I think you probably heard when you listen to financial reports or takeovers or something, people talk about how much tier one acreage they bought or how are they running out of tier one drilling opportunities? And what this is telling you is that the tier one stuff is not really distinguishable from the tier two or two tier three that ultimately what happens on shale is a matter of the intelligence of the people who are doing it, how well they pick that specific location. The rock changes and it changes unpredictably and quickly. It's as a engineer say heterogeneous, right? Right. So there's no question that it played a classifying shale plays into tiers had a played a big role in terms of the marketing of the shale sectors assets. But then, you know, 10 years into this shale revolution or maybe 15 years and they're looking and they're saying that this is kind of what we hear on the conference circuit a lot rock quality matters. But then good engineering matters, too. And I think the nut of this report is that rock was perhaps oversold a little bit in comparison, like you said, to the engineering capabilities. Well, it kind of goes back to what I remember from a few years ago in our tech conference. Once one guy said unconventional is just bad quality reservoir rock. So the best of it isn't great. And so it is a question of if you're using cheap meat, you have to be pretty careful as a cook to make it into something that's edible and good. And that's the challenge the industry is facing. And another kind of illusion here is that we all had the sense, didn't you, Trent, that as you heard earnings reports clocking out better and better IPs that they were making a lot of progress and doing a lot of better wells? Yeah, I think generally that was the theme that we heard year after year and we saw it in the data. But then we also know that year after year wells tended to get longer and they tended to have more profit put in them. So it's hard to sort of normalize, you know, a 2015 data set or, you know, versus something that's been more recently completed. Right. And in this study, they looked at it and said, well, OK, if you normalize it and I think it's a 10,000 foot and you look at the results over multiple years, how are they doing? Are they improving? And what they discovered is that 60% of the wells drill since 2010. We're going to produce less than 750 bears of oil equivalent means oil and a lot less valuable gas over the last four years. 50% are right around that level. So that just means that in the great mass of wells, looking at these big hit wells wasn't a really good way of understanding what was really going on when they looked at it. And they said that, you know, some companies are doing more with their tier one or more with their tier two than some of their peers. The assumptions were made based on, you know, this company just has more technical talent or did they actually outline any specific operational changes or anything that made these top performers stand out? So what they did was they did created a tier one tier two map and compare it with industry standards. So you knew they were looking at a realistic thing. They didn't try to get into the inputs of the intellectual inputs of these things. Right. But they did look at the physical inputs and they specifically the one that was the mantra a few years back, which was use more sand, use more oil, use more oil. Use more sand, use more fluid. And what they found, and this is a very kind of an accounting point of view, because after all, Deloitte is an accounting firm. And what they're saying is in a lot of cases, they were spending too much money on these things that that when they looked at it, despite putting in 25% more profit and fluid productivity from 2016, 2018 was pretty much flat. So what they're saying is to recognize that perhaps these aren't going to be stellar wells that you can't turn the chuck roast into filet mignon. You should spend on it what it deserves and look at it and spend less. They found that with the old smaller wells or the lower potential wells, if they put more into it, it didn't turn it into something different. And I wonder if it seems counterintuitive, but is there, you know, we have people like Mark Papa, CEO Centennial and former head of EOG, saying that most of the tier ones been developed. And so I wonder if the lack of a huge delta between tier one and tier two actually could be a blessing in disguise going forward. If most of tier one has been exhausted and US Yale plays and then there's more tier two and it performs somewhat similarly to tier one. So maybe there's a silver lining there, but I get it on the aggregate. It seems like this was sort of an unexpected thing. I think we all took tier one, tier two, tier three stuff at face value because a lot of data wasn't in trying to maintain the fiction. The report said we're starting to challenge the notion that just investing in established tier one acreage and drilling a longer lateral and pumping more profit means more productive wells. It's just simply a more complicated thing that if you look at the rock, it isn't like the old days where you if you put the well in just the right place. It would flow like crazy when you hit that great mother load. That world isn't there now. You know, the later part of the story looked at what engineers are doing to, in their case, look at type wells. What's the typical well in any location to do and trying to chop it and just chopping these reservoirs into much finer, finer pieces that reflect the fact that they change a lot. Right. And then also that requires dealing with the fact that when you get closer and closer, your data gets thinner and thinner. So the risk that you're wrong and bad wrong is greater. So they're also having to get into fairly complicated work measuring what uncertainty they have. So basically, a where do you think the good rock is? B, what's the level of doubt you should impose on the decision making process? All that seems like actually a little bit refreshing for me. I imagine is for you to just because we've always seen a little bit of disconnect between sort of the I.R. And then the heavy duty technical world of shale. And you could point a number of issues where that exists on this stuff. You know, a lot of technical discussions or an almost, you know, the last six, seven years that I've been going to. I can't remember the last time anybody from the technical community referred to anything as a tier one or tier two asset. What I have heard people talk a lot about is what you were talking about, the heterogeneity and just the amazing amount of difference you can see spatially from a one mile well distance. You know, the rock changes, the pressure can change the API gravity, the fluid characterizations can change. And so when we see these big blobs on these maps of tier one and tier two, I always kind of did question the veracity of looking at it that way, just because it seemed way too broad. Given all the talks that we go to. And it's like, hey, things change rapidly. Like I said, for mile to mile, these wells are different. These reservoirs are different. Exactly. And as I did this, I just looked at the words tier one in the one petro. Of course, it's a great source of trying to figure out what engineers think about this basically financial concept, barely anything in there. And I realized that that's exactly it. I was I had this big worry that's like I had what I thought was an interesting idea in the Deloitte thing that would catch people's attention. But on the other hand, you wonder if the engineer would like send you a message afterwards and saying, you think that an area that covers millions of acres is going to be all the same? I mean, duh, it's not. And that's why I started looking at what they were doing on this other side and what they're doing on type wells. And it's a very big controversial area, because as you're writing about now, these type wells are how do you figure out what things should actually produce and what's realistic? And that's another thing this industry is struggling with is not only what what they'll do in the first year, but what they'll do after five years. Yeah, well, I think it's I think definitely noteworthy of covering that we are looking into sort of the type well, the type curves, the technology that's going into that right now. What we're generally seeing is this convergence of sort of the financial world and the technical world. And they lived in two different houses. And now their roommates is sort of how you could describe this next decade. And it's going to be very interesting to see how the terminology, the ways of looking at shale from all different angles, how they sort of merge together. And one of the last things I want to say when I was tweeting out this story, I put like sort of a alternative headline there and I said, you know, shedding tears. And and I wonder, you know, stories like yours are going to bring in an era where we just stopped talking about these heterogeneous plays this way with such broad strokes. It is a talking issue. And then the paper brought out that companies who are selling the simplistic version of reality are going to have to find a way to kind of recalibrate how they talk about it and say, look, these are genuine problems. You know, these are difficult wells. They don't produce a huge amount. We're not necessarily going to suddenly produce 30 percent of what's in the ground. And how are we working on these problems and how are we moving toward making enough money to keep investors happy? So should we move to another area of unconventionals? Heavy oil is considered an unconventional, right? It is something that's very hard to produce. And it is economically tough right now because the heavy oil I'm writing about is in Western Canada and Western Canada lacks the pipeline access. So American oil people will gripe about fifty five dollar barrel. And these guys are selling oil for thirty eight dollars a barrel. Yeah. So the story was about an interesting company called Salamander and they got a heating cable. There's two aspects that make selling that heating cable hard. One is the price is low so that if you produce 50 percent more barrels, they're still not worth a whole lot. But the other problem is that what's new about with their cable isn't that it heats up oil wells. It's that it doesn't break down like the cables did in the past. So don't you run into this periodically that someone has a good new idea, but it's been tried before and it didn't work. I think that defines oil gas innovation. To some large extent. I mean, even in this story, as I was reading it, you know, Shell developed this technology originally. I've written that line in half a dozen technology stories where somebody is taking something that 20 years ago was put down hold. Didn't work. And then all of a sudden that idea is given new life because materials and technologies a little bit better. And yet it remains a tough sell. Yeah. The memories in this industry are really, really long. I mean, I remember the quote from Salamander was, you know, I talked to an operator. He said that when they put a cable down before, the performance is great. As long as the cables there, it broke down. It never used again. Now, what's interesting is in this case, they developed it to heat up wells at a lot higher at 650 degrees. That was because Shell was trying to produce oil shale, which I have to go back to the magazine because I can never remember oil shale versus shale oil. Right. But oil shale is carriage and rich rock were extremely expensive. But oil shale is carriage and rich rock were extreme heat can extract a lot of oil, unlike shale oil where it's just a really tight rock. And because it was this thing was designed to do 650 to Fahrenheit, the 300 Fahrenheit that they're going to be generating in these wells is not really a big challenge. And they say and I think they make a convincing case that they can do it reliably and have not had a breakdown of the well because they were torture tested by Shell. Shell, it's a gas more location, which actually is in my neighborhood, which I'm proud to know that a lot of innovations happened. Okay. And was it Southwest Houston? Exactly. In Southwest Houston, a lot of amazing stuff was tested down there. What's interesting to me is as I was reading this and thinking about, you know, analogies like you were kind of bringing up one of them that hit me was like fiber optics. You know, it used to suffer from what they call darkening. The fibers would just, you know, basically turn black or, you know, not deliver data anymore. And these things were super expensive permanent fiber optics installation still cost about a million dollars in some cases. And that really harmed uptake. And then it got over that hump and darkening was more or less solved. And now fiber optic is one, maybe one of the fastest growing technology applications in the U.S. Different end outcome here than this kind of heating cable. This is kind of like E.O.R. in a sense, I guess. But after that hump, you know, you might be poised for rapid adoption. Fiber has found a problem that people needed to help solve and has found ways to be more cost effective. In this case, we all began with a paper at the annual meeting where they talked about a 50 percent gain early on in a well at a shell development. But even though it was hundreds of others, Wells is why they never used it because the payoff just wasn't that large because of the low price environment they were in. You know, they always say don't use this in your dog well, use it in your best well, because the gains will be even better. But that's an incredibly hard sell for operators to say I'm going to experiment with my best well. No, I want to experiment with the one that I don't mind losing. Exactly. Exactly. And so that is their trick. I mean, 50 percent more of 27 barrels a day doesn't pay the bills very well. So that that is the trick they have is can they find someone like the big sag D operas different kind of heavy oil? Well, but they think that you could use that and speed up the initial production and maybe ultimately produce more over time. And they've that'll be tried. And the other thing is the thing we're seeing over and over in the hour, it starts really good, but it doesn't last that over time that you see the line of the heated wells and the unheated wells kind of converge. And don't you see it over and over in the hour? Yeah. And also here, you know, one of the things that we don't talk a lot about is sort of the capex side of things and, you know, electricity is not free. And then, you know, these are already low yielding wells. And so even if you get some decent percentage of uplift, the bottom line is it's not going to maybe change the company's revenue stream all that much unless you scale these things up. And that's usually where technology hits all sorts of problems in the shell world. It's the cost of moving gas around and trying to inject it. And then in the heavy oil world, this thermal stuff, at least in this case, you know, electric prices in Alberta are somewhat higher than West Texas. Well, actually, you point to a very good variable. That is a big one in terms of on their list of what wells you want to use it in. You know, you're out in some pretty extreme countries. So in some places they have grid priced electricity and that makes it possible. But if they got to generate their own in the middle of nowhere, that could be a real issue. Yeah. Driving through Texas, we always see pump jacks. And I always remind my wife those are not perpetual motion machines. They have to have electricity to run. And when you see them stopped, sometimes it's because, you know, the electric bill got too high. So is there anything else for this one or do you want to move on to our our final topic and take a quick break? Let's deal with destruction next. We want you to join the discussion with us on social media. If you want to grab our attention, we're asking everybody to use the hashtag SB podcast. All these stories are online. They're already in print. And in the show notes, we're going to put links to them so that you can go read them. OK, Steve, so the last topic we were going to get to from the January issue of JPT was my story on casing failures and horizontal wells. If you're following this podcast, you heard a very lengthy one about casing failures with one of the sources, George King, who's a consultant, the leading voices, leading experts in the shale world in general on a whole host of topics. I think this deserves an extra look. And JPT. And that's why we we wrote a big feature about it because a there's a lot of people talking about it and B as we see with some of these emerging issues, there's not a lot of technical information on this. You know, if you were going to go Google for a list of best practices to avoid casing failures, I mean, we're talking mostly about the lateral part of these wells. You're not going to find a big you know, what to do list or a big list of best practices. Are there any obvious questions right now that everyone's trying to answer? Is it just a matter of just what is the extent of the problem and where is it? Yeah, so there's two ways of I kind of look when I came in approach this report, there's people in the community that haven't heard of this issue. And so for those folks, what we're talking about is the casing will deform somehow during the frac job. So, you know, as hydraulic fracturing is taking place at some point, you could have the casing oval can kind of squeezed. You can have holes be formed through sand erosion from leaking plugs. So sands flowing under a plug and it's creating a little erosion path and it's just eating away to steel like tissue paper. And so on the cover, we have images of that exact phenomena where it's actually putting literal holes in the casing. And then you have other cases where it squeezes so far down, you can't get another plug in. Maybe you can get a perforation gun, but you can't get a plug in. And then you had the most extreme cases where the pipe is cut. So this could happen at 1000 feet from the toe. This could happen 5000 feet in the middle of the lateral and you lose a ton of well worth. So there's lots of causes, lots of outcomes. So it's not just one monolithic issue. The pictures are pretty dramatic. You look at and think, well, you must know that's going on down there. But what's the reality? How do people experience this? The service is just taking a long time to come around because people just don't know that stuff is there. Well, so it's not something that you report to any sort of regulator. So that's one reason why there's not a lot of public data or good statistics on this. Some people think in the US or certain place where it's 20 to 30 percent of the time, these pictures on the cover were taken by a startup in based in Vancouver called Dark Vision. They use an ultrasonic logging tool, essentially, to go and take the image of the inside of the well bore. These holes they saw in their very first job a few years ago, and they've only been in about 100 plus wells. And they've seen this fairly commonly. And I think in that first well, they told me it's in the story. Five holes in a well with about 20 or 25 stages. So that's a pretty good percentage of having these failures. The fact that these guys are kind of doing, you know, doing pretty good from what I can tell for a startup suggests that there's not a lot of ways to look inside of a dirty well and see anything. Yeah. So there's other companies that require you to have a clear fluid to send a camera down there. So we're talking about the folks from E.V. and others. We've seen really good papers, really good research come out of this, mostly around perforation erosion studies. And that's actually how these images from Dark Vision were acquired. The company was using them initially just to study the pervs. And then they were going down there. These guys don't have a hardcore oil and gas background. So they said we saw some really big holes. We don't think they're perforations because they're not where the perforations were supposed to be. At least what you guys told us, they were where plugs were. So that's one case of these kind of events happening. I've heard subsequently, like in sort of in the hallways of conferences at the annual meeting, you know, people were talking about this same problem. It was referred to in papers on China where this problem is happening sometimes 40 percent in the field. The Szechuan Basin, which is sort of their permeation. They're trying to learn about that. I was learning mostly just about the geologic challenges of developing shale in China. This issue didn't actually come up until I started researching it. Hands down, the Chinese researchers, university students and operators have written the most amount of information on this or produced the most information on this. They're seeking answers. And one of the reasons is it's very severe there. And so in China, a lot of people think that it's the tectonics. You know, they may have plug issues, too, but they see sharing events where the well is just cut in half in the lateral during the frac job. And that's when that happens. It's gone. You know, you did it. Yeah, I mean, there are some signs. Yeah. Other signs and other ways, as you pointed out, it's kind of hard to notice that these things are happening until you jam up a plug. Does tectonics play a role in where this is a worry here? I mean, is it a bigger deal? It hasn't come up in my reporting in the United States as much. It has an Argentina. What's similar between Argentina and China? Well, the Szechuan Basin in China is sort of in the shadows of the Himalayas. Everybody knows what those are. And then the Vaca Muerta in Argentina is in the shadow of the Andes. And so wherever you have mountains pulling up the tectonics, like sort of like a tent, you have unique stresses that you don't have in most US shale plays. Because if you look at the Permian, it's sort of known for being very flat. You look at the Eagleford in South Texas, also pretty flat. Go to the Bakken. There's some hills, but no giant mountains. Canada, though, is going to get to Canada has more tectonic activity. But again, that issue, that specific cause didn't come up so much with my reporting in Canada. But also the one that came at the most here in the United States and George King has stressed this over and over is the it starts with drilling. And so if you have a highly undulating well bore with a bunch of sharp angles, you're going to create point loading and all sorts of stresses. So, you know, to sum up my quick ramble here, there are a lot of reasons why this can happen. There's a lot of outcomes of when it does happen and there are very few ways to fix it. It's very hard to predict. Just using thicker steel on some of this casing is not the ultimate solution. And what people think is the solution is just doing the full boat here of taking in all of the geomechanical properties of the area drilling into trying to drill the smoothest well bore when you're fracturing, not blindly doing it, but sort of looking for these telltale signs, looking for if you have a hole in the casing, maybe have a pressure drop or you actually never get up to the rate you wanted to. That means you have a leak somewhere. Right. So trying to holistically look at the earth and how all of the operations fit into how it's going to react. That sort of seems to be where people are talking about. One other thing I'll say here is that the modeling efforts are very nascent. So there's not one piece of software that operators can go to and put in all the inputs that they have available and then get sort of a plan of action for preventing casing failures. And at the Fracturing Conference, which is less than a month away from today, what do you expect they'll be talking about? Well, they're going to have several operators there, folks from Chronicle Phillips and XTO and others, I believe BP is on there and in Kana. We're going to have a three hour panel session where these operators present case studies and the organizers of the event have been working for several months, maybe close to a year on trying to get operators to come to the table, specifically U.S. and Canadian operators to come to the table, you know, show your cards, tell us what you know about this problem. And at Ertech, they had one and George mentioned it during the podcast and we wrote about in the story. It was a standing room only room for a panel discussion and there weren't that many operators on that panel. So I believe there's like 300 people there and they stayed for a couple hours. This one's going to be three hours. There's going to be no competing events. It's the third day of the Hydraulic Fracturing Technology Conference in the Woodlands, first week of February. And on that third day, there's no show floor. There's no exhibition down there anymore. They cut that off about one all casing failure and no more papers, all casing failure for three hours. So, you know, I'll be in that room taking notes. And so we're going to do an update to this and share what the operators are sharing. Yeah, the way it does seem like the early days of frac hits where people are just saying, you know, I'm an operator and I have frac hits. I kind of phrased this on LinkedIn. I said, you know, as opposed to frac hits, the call is coming from inside the house. If you remember that scary line there, frac hits are usually characterized as events between two or more wells interacting. This is largely seen as a intro well event. So this is that one well doing it to itself now. In field drilling and depletion and fluidizing sections of rock all can play into this. But really, it's about that one well well board what's happening inside. And the other thing that's different for me after covering frac hits for three or four years, when the frac hit problem arose, it became clear very quickly that it was a systemic issue. I don't think everybody saw that. But what we started to see that because of where the technical information was coming from and one Petro and at the conferences, you started to see it didn't really matter what stripe you were as an operator. You were you were having this problem. I will say, as I've been beating the street for the last couple of years looking for, you know, the next big challenge, this one sort of came out of obscurity for me. So I actually haven't met as many people at this early stage that are talking about this as I did when I was first reporting on frac hits. So it remains to be seen how big of an issue casing failures is. But some of the numbers, like I said, that are being shared are significant enough. You have China saying this happens at 40 percent of some of our fields and you have George King saying he's seen data from operators suggesting that in certain fields in the U.S., which he has not named 20 to 30 percent of the time, some type of casing failure, some type of casing deformation happens. And when we put this on LinkedIn, somebody commented that they seen this before. They sounded like a field operator or field hand. And they said that they would just run the gun through the deformation because the gun has a slimmer profile than a plug. And just frack a giant stage. They didn't really get specific on how long. But you can imagine if you hit a block and you could be trying to frack a stage that's 300 feet long. It's like a perf as big as a sewer cover. Something like, well, you still want to get your stages in, right? But you can't isolate them. So you're going to do this giant cluster, I guess, just because you get your stages in. So totally not a perfect remedy, but it shows you how people are starting having to adjust on the fly in the field. Well, you know, I've written about drilling. There's always this thought that, well, if you had better hole quality, it would be valuable. But it's really hard to put a number on it. It seems like with frack, it's the initial thing was, oh, there's this horrible destructive event. But then the more they looked at it, the more you realize subtle, useful things about it. It's possible that over time they'll realize that, you know, if you do certain things better to well, that you have longer term benefits that, you know, not so much dramatic, but useful. And just add a little bit to that, you know, that difficult to add thing, which is unconventional results. You know, I kind of mentioned I think that like taking a holistic approach to shell, like doing everything right and doing everything for the same purpose, like in unison. You know, we just talk about the disconnect between drilling and completions and, you know, everybody out there that's worked in the shell. They know what I'm talking about there. Bringing those all together so that drillers think about undulating well bores is sort of where the shell business needs to go per a lot of experts, you know, especially George King. And if you look at frack, it's a driller. You know, there's a couple of operational things you can take frack hits while drilling. But, you know, for the most part, a driller is not super concerned with frack. It's not thinking about them when you start saying that my casings buckling or it's over torquing or having point loading. And because of that, when I actually do pressure up and frack, I'm having issues. I'm having deformations. My casings losing its integrity. Well, then you can blame you can tell the driller, hey, you know, we need straighter wells like you can, you know, that matters to them. Well, we can cement it properly, too, which is another issue that if you want the world to last. Yeah, that cement jobs came up in this too. And I should have mentioned that. But that five, six years of beating the street with shell producers, you'll hear a lot about poor cement jobs. It's just very difficult to do in the lateral section. It was cementing technology as it is was never meant to really fully cover the casing ones. It's in that lateral section. And so if you don't have something fully supported, then you get problems. And we know that those are problems also in the vertical section of these wells, too. And not in this story, but there's a company just north of here in Houston called Deep Imaging. And I visited their office for another story. Actually, it was a frac diagnostic r"
"SPE President's Podcast with Terry Palisch: ""Creating Our Energy Future"" - The Crucial Role of Soft Skills in Engineering - June 2024","Good morning. Good afternoon. My name is Trey Schaefer. I'm a senior partner with environmental resources management, and I spend most of my time focused on the topics of sustainability and climate for the oil and gas sector. As part of its sustainability journey, SPE founded GAIA nearly a year ago in collaboration with many, including IPECA, IOGP, OGCI, and our sister society, AAPG. Its basic premise is to help ensure that the oil and gas industry comes out on the right side of history, valued for our contributions, yet agile and imaginative enough to evolve with changing expectations of our role in society. At our first GAIA summit in France during the summer of 2019, which seems like a lifetime ago, 55 of us began to co-create a sustainability blueprint that will mobilize the individuals in the oil and gas industry. One of the many outcomes of that effort was a collaboration between SPE and OGCI to create a series of dialogues between thought leaders on climate change in the oil and gas industry and the broader oil and gas community around the world. Our aim was to deepen the understanding around issues of climate change and receive feedback from the wider oil and gas industry on the energy transition. We planned a series of these dialogues over 2020 with Global Scope, and we'll be discussing other topics like CCUS and collaborative action, among others. Our discussion today will focus on methane emissions in the oil and gas industry value chain and how industry is responding, the need for ongoing response and innovation going forward. And also, as we look toward the need for methane reduction and decarbonization, we see a number of challenges ahead. Our initial collaboration is expanded, and today, SPE, OGCI, IOGP, and IEA, as well as Darcy Spady, a past SPE president representing Carbon Connect International, have come together to form our panel. And my distinguished guests include Julian Perez, the vice president of strategy and policy at OGCI climate investments, Tim Gould, the head of division for the world energy outlook and investment at IEA, Wendy Brown, the environment director at IOGP, and then again, Darcy Spady, managing partner for Carbon Connect International. And really, To kick this thing off today, we'd like to set the stage with a fundamental question. Why is methane emission reduction a priority for the oil and gas industry? Thanks for the question. I think I'm going to jump in first. The little guy who has spent some time in the SPE world and is very thankful that we're discussing this. Quite honestly, as a former SPE president, this is an incredible day, and I can't be happier than the group of panelists I'm surrounded by. But the biggest issue, why is this a priority? It's 25 times worse than CO2 from a global warming perspective. So methane is super important. It's an easy win. The technology exists. Everything we are trying to fix in the space or most things we're trying to fix, we installed. We know where they are. And then we have the added benefit of completion technology. Who's been thinking about temporary installations like post-frack flowbacks and things like this? So I think it's a great, easy start that we can demonstrate to the world that we're serious about climate things in general. We don't want to debate. We want to fix problems that are easy to fix. And with pressure from financial institutions, from the public, we have a chance to really come out of the gate strong, have some solid easy wins and do a lot of good for the planet. That's how I'd answer the first question of why it's a priority. Thanks, Darcy. I think you bring a unique perspective as a petroleum engineer. Maybe I can chip in as Tim Gold from the International Energy Agency. I certainly agree with everything that Darcy said. I think this should be considered an easy win. We should also remember that the oil and gas sector isn't the only source of methane emissions. It's not the only source of manmade methane emissions, but it might be the one that's easiest to mitigate. Unlike CO2, methane has commercial value. So any methane that's captured can be monetized. And we have to recognize that that's probably easier to do in the oil and gas sector than elsewhere in the energy sector. And it's probably easier in the energy sector than it is in agriculture, which is the other main source of anthropogenic methane emissions. So the oil and gas has an opportunity because the emissions reductions here can result in economic savings, can be realized at lower cost. And of course, it's a critically important element of the future of these liquids and gases in the global energy system. Thank you, Tim. I'll contribute now. Hello, everyone. For me, it's simple. Two main reasons. As Darcy and Tim have just said, it's the right thing to do for the planet. And the second, the credibility of gas as a solution for the energy transition depends on our ability to tackle methane emissions. So that's undoubtedly one of the most important reasons. The role of gas is challenged worldwide. And, you know, convincing people that gas is no better and even worse than coal because of methane. So we need to really tackle the methane emissions, even though, as Tim has said, oil and gas emissions represent, you know, a relatively small part of the overall methane emissions of the order of 12%. It's something that we can do it and we have to do it. So it is very important for our industry. If I may jump in as well, just to also complete what my colleagues say, and I feel very humbled to speak right after all of them. I think maybe in addition to what was said, the saving potential on methane and the consequences of the temperature increase could be quite summarized as well by the fact that as of today, methane is estimated to be responsible of the quarter of the temperature increase that we experience. So it's quite an important greenhouse gas that has been roughly neglected, I think, in most of the case for the past decades, because it was less known than the CO2. So the attention was less important on methane. But now we realize that we can make a lot of saving on that, particularly because you can reduce the stock of methane present in the atmosphere by playing on the flow considering that the lifetime of methane is relatively short compared to CO2. So by playing on the flow, you can reduce the stock relatively easily. And so you can address a quarter of the issue in a very quick manner. And it's true that the oil and gas industry has clearly a role to play. It represents a portion of the issue, but a portion that can be addressed and fixed because the technology is there. And because probably the sources of methane in the oil and gas industry are certainly concentrated across a very small number of big emitters. So in terms of a cost-efficient analysis, make you quickly conclude that this is the thing to address. That's a really interesting point, Julian, that there's a few things that we can do, not everything, that can make a big shift and a big change. Thanks for adding that perspective. We've been seeing quite a number of really ambitious announcements coming in from oil and gas companies. Various CEOs are making public statements. And it's sort of an exciting time for the industry in terms of the intent of these statements of ambition. And thinking about methane reduction specifically, as opposed to, let's say, a compliance activity, is the pace of change coming along fast enough for the sector in light of all the pressure that we're seeing from society and from investors? I can say a couple of words on that. I certainly agree it's an exciting time. There are some very interesting commitments being made, some quite far-reaching commitments being made. But from our perspective, from the International Energy Agency, you know, we see that the overall pace of change is still well short of what is potentially available and what would be needed to really tackle climate change. So around 80 million tons a year in our estimation of methane leaks, methane emissions from oil and gas operations. So we reckon that around 75% of that could be technically possible to abate. And more than 40% of that total we think could be abated at no net cost. So like the value of the captured methane would be higher than the abatement measure. And in our view, there's still a lot of work to do to really ingrain that culture of methane abatement into company operations in the same way that you've seen for safety over many decades. Now the good news is, and this you can see from some of the leading companies, that when companies focus on it, they've shown that it's possible to get the emissions down. They found that it's very cost effective. They've typically found that it's easier and cheaper than they had anticipated upfront. But there is that wide spectrum of performance across the industry. Some are doing very well, but I have to say that there are others who are simply not paying as much attention to this issue. There's governance issues, there's operational practices. And so the issue is not just about raising standards among the best, just to get attention to this from across the whole spectrum of industry actors. And that I think is a crucial challenge. It's one that we've been talking with OGCI about. How do you focus not just on your own performance, but how do you really spread those best practices across the industry as a whole? That's such a great point. Well, I'll jump in. I'm thrilled to be in a jurisdiction in Alberta where we're leading the way. I know there's other jurisdictions on Earth, but one thing I'm seeing is through the practice of methane measurement and emission, we get very good at what we're doing and the costs come down. So all of a sudden you're leaving 1% or 2% of more gas in the sales line and you're breeding technology, developing technology in a very cost-effective space with lots of little participants, which I might add is good for COVID because it means lots of little contractors on the ground doing lots of little things. So it's really good to be in a jurisdiction that's practicing because as we learn, we can roll it out to the rest of the globe. As you referred to, Tim, in your comments, that it's not just the leaders, but everybody has to do it. But it's coming, it's easy, it's cost-effective and it's there. So I think there's a really bright future in the rollout part. Yeah. And if I can maybe come in here, we've been collecting data for the last 20 years from our members and we see big differences in different regions of the world. So, I mean, for example, Europe, the methane intensity is about half of what we see at the global level. And we also see big differences between different members. I mean, overall, I would say that the pace of change is probably not fast enough. I think everything our industry is doing is really commended. But at the global level, we really need to step up the pace and drive improvement across the whole industry. And I think there are some real pockets of good practice, as you would say. There's some excellent examples. And I think if you look at the IEA methane tracker, some fantastic examples there were, for example, you take Norway, where their numbers were 24 times higher than they actually were. And they came in, they showed all the good work that they were doing. And obviously, some of our members, particularly the OGCI companies, they do have a very good level of performance. And we just need to really make sure that we get that level extended across the whole industry. So, there's a lot of efforts ongoing to try and achieve that. But yeah, there's a lot of work to be done still. Trey, I'll just comment on the OGCI side. But as Wendy highlighted, our companies are starting from quite low because if you look at the methane intensity over the gas that is delivered to the market, we emit 0.32% in 2017 of methane. And they have committed collectively to reach 0.25 by 2025, and potentially 0.2, which is our ambition. So, if you translate that into a slope or trend of reduction, that means a reduction from one fifth to one third. And as Tim highlighted, we try to expand this intensity as some kind of a good practice standard that we would like other companies to look at. So, if the rest of the industry was doing the same as we do, we estimate that the saving could be roughly around 25 million tons of methane assisted with the ambition. And that translates if you take the global warming potential of 30, roughly. That means nearly one gigaton of CO2 saving potential. And the world is emitting 50 to make a rounded figure. Tim, under your control. Again, I feel very humbled to speak about figure in front of the IEA, but that's roughly speaking the range of figure. So, that's a big saving potential. And that's why also we engage with a number of players outside of the value chain, but also with countries for them to set up those targets ahead and give it basically the direction of travel that each of us will have to follow in the next few years to make that happen. Getting a handle on O&M as a real driver for making a dent in the reduction of methane emissions. But I think it might even go a little further back in the design. Starting from the design into the O&M, there's a lot of opportunity. And what are the things we're seeing that are going to be making a shift in that sort of dimension? For example, why are we still designing facilities that have known methane emitters in terms of the equipment that we know? We know it already. Why does that continue to happen? What's the driver for that? Well, I think one driver is to know where the emissions come from. And there is a need to improve the quality of the information of where the emission happened. Because most of the time the methane emissions are associated with leaks. And so being able to detect where the emissions have come from is probably the first step. And then you can fix them. So you can act on things that you can measure and that you know. So I think that's probably one thing where the technology improvement helped a lot because we have been equipped by the market with a number of new technologies in the past recent years. And those are working pretty well. So I'm pretty sure that this is going to happen in the next few years. We're probably going to see a change in trends in that domain. Thank you all. I was going to follow up with another question related to near-term priorities for the industry. Kind of following on from that discussion. You know, so what are the top near-term priorities? And what can the industry do to make a step change in methane emission reduction? Okay, well, thanks, Trey. I'll have a go at that. I think it's a massive subject and we could spend a long time. I'm just going to maybe highlight three main areas that I think could be key to this. I think the first one, and we've touched on it a little bit already, but is improvement of data accuracy. Now, as Julien said, and I think Tim, there's high uncertainty in the numbers and essentially a robust fit for purpose monitoring, reporting, verification of methane emissions is what we need. And we need that to provide consistent transparent emissions data from all the companies emitting. So that's the number one without a doubt. And we can talk more about that. There's a number of things ongoing and started which will help. Number two is if companies can all follow the methane emissions best practices. And here I'm going to give a shout out to the methane guiding principles best practices toolkit. If all the companies were following all those best practices, that would be a fantastic that would be a fantastic start as well. And they include all the different areas from flaring, pneumatic devices, and of course leak detection and repair. And the third is to establish methane emissions targets. So I think those three, if all the companies really worked on following those that that could make a real step change in the industry. So we can certainly talk in more detail about all of those. But that I would say, I don't know what you others think on that. But those are my three top recommendations. Maybe I can say a couple of words on this, because I mean, it's me that we're all agreeing that this is an opportunity. But that really begs the question about why isn't it happening then? You know, if there is an opportunity here, if it delivers these benefits, if a lot of it can be cost effective, then what's the problem in a sense for to address this? And a few things that we probably need to be aware of, and many of them dovetail with what Wendy was just saying. I mean, it could be a lack of information about the problem. So a lack of measurement, lack of awareness about emissions levels or the cost effectiveness of action. Sometimes it's an infrastructure issue. You know, you have a saturated local market that makes it difficult to match your additional gas to a productive use. But often you just don't get the incentives in place. The competition for capital within the company, or it could be insufficiently quick perceptions of payback periods, also because you're not valuing that climate benefit from methane. Or you just you have these split incentives where the owner of the equipment doesn't directly benefit from reducing leaks, or the owner of the gas infrastructure doesn't see its full value. So in a sense, tackling some of those barriers is also going to be important. But as it's been said, you know, there are ways of doing that. So you know, it's really a question of building up that momentum. And in our view, you know, there is a role for well designed regulation. I mean, you know, coming from Canada, you know that very well. But, you know, that's, that's an interesting area for many countries, including in Europe to be looking at. That's excellent. Trey, I'm going to jump in with a comment. Two comments. One is the importance of baseline. I mean, part of what we in our organization like to call MEM is methane measurement and mitigation. So before we measure it, before we have that baseline, we're kind of wandering around talking about things. But it's so important to get that baseline and understand the measurement and then we mitigate. But I just want to reach out to all the more average petroleum engineer SP members that are maybe probably not on this call. And we have so many bad practices to Wendy's point number two about best best practices. How many times in the drilling completion world did we see in the procedure vent to atmosphere? Who's the guy on the valve bar blowing back the whatever to the sky? These are practices that us old geezers did for years and years in the field. We can't do them anymore. And so I think part of the step change is the number the younger generation understands that the comment vent atmosphere or blow down as a procedure is unacceptable. We have to put that gas that effluent that emission, we have to put it somewhere. And that is part of the change of the greater body of SP members. Like, no, you don't vent atmosphere, that is incorrect. So there's a psychological change to Wendy's point number two as well. I was thinking as I was listening to Wendy, that, you know, we're talking about, I think we're talking in this context about actual measurement, not in terms of compliance reporting, which may not be an actual measurement. So how are we going to shift from, let's say, a compliance mentality to an actual measurement mentality and knowing what our baseline is? I mean, you know, Wendy provided a good example of, you know, there's been a number of interesting measurement campaigns that have taken place in Norway, there's been a number in North America. You know, that is just essential information. You know, by and large, when you start to have real readings about methane emissions, you do understand that those desktop calculations based on emissions factors, they can be off by a considerable amount. That said, you know, some of the new data that's becoming available, particularly from aerial measurements and even satellite data, that's going to introduce a lot of transparency into this picture, particularly for some of the larger intermittent but very significant leaks. So there are new sources of data that will become available and that will show which jurisdictions and which companies are paying attention to this issue and in a sense where the laggards are as well. So in a sense, there is transparency coming and it's in the interest of companies, it's the interest of companies, of countries to know that there will be a light shined on where those leaks are taking place. That's an interesting point, you know, sort of the democratization of information and the information relative to society, but it also probably points to something else that you were talking about is the democratization of information within companies so that the engineers and the people that are trying to solve these problems understand what's happening so that they can begin to make the changes needed on the design stage, on the design front, O&M and the various, let's say, stages of the life cycle of an asset. Does anybody else have a comment on this particular topic? If I may try, just to echo what Tim was saying, I think there is clearly the emission factor, we're built on very old data and the need to introduce the technology, you know, capacity to have a better understanding of where the emissions are happening or where the continuous emission could happen. And so progressively as well, you know, improve those bottom-up versus top-down approach and close the gap progressively because there will be a need also for the very small producer and I'm thinking of the Permian, for instance, where they may not have the capacity to have a drone campaign on a regular basis or LDR campaign on a regular basis but if by the technology and if by having an approach where we compare what the measurement offer and what the emission on the engineering calculation can do and close those gaps and get very much more precise approach, that would definitely help as well the industry to progressively change the mindset, as you said, and tackle the issue and also having the country to set up the appropriate standards for the industry to follow and so have a better control, etc. So it's really like we're already on the edge of changing the approach on methane because we realize that this is an important topic but also at the same time we have the technology that is appearing and that enable us to tackle it in a much more meaningful way. You know, convincing internal managers about making these investments and I think one of the underlying issues there is integrating cost of carbon into your business planning would be a one way to shift it because obviously that's going to be a factor if you're integrating some cost of carbon into the business case. I think the bankers are going to make it really easy because the people who fund the banks are saying they're the general population and they're saying people, we need to think about the environment so Mr. Banker, Ms. Banker, you're not giving a loan to this oil company unless they can account for carbon. So I think the world is changing very rapidly and from a business case, if companies start really, you know, when I was shipping gas you'd get the monthly reports and they had a column called shrinkage and that was a whole bunch of different things including, you know, facilities costs and losses and this and that. I'd bet 2% of that shrinkage would be nothing that was vented. That's 2% more sales gas net in the line. So there is a business case, we have to start thinking about it. I was just going to follow on from what Julian said in terms of all the new technologies that are coming in and okay they may be expensive initially but we're seeing in some countries operators collaborating together and, you know, sharing facilities like you said, it may not be possible for everyone to have their own drone or, you know, satellite, aircraft, you know, there are definitely opportunities there for collaboration in different regions and that's something that we're seeing and we're encouraging and, you know, in the Netherlands for example, you know, they've done campaigns, you know, over the whole region, you know, and set, you know, massive 50% reduction targets so I think, you know, you need to be working in coordination with others and in collaboration to make things as economical as possible. I'll just chip in to say that, you know, if you do start to introduce a price on carbon or a price on carbon equivalence which, you know, many companies say that they're doing is they screen projects and so on but in some jurisdictions it's not always the case it's mandated by regulation, you know, then the other bits of the methane chain that is currently kind of non-economic that quickly becomes economic. If you have a price of, you know, $15 a ton of CO2, you know, pretty much all of that 75% that's technically abatable, you know, becomes an economic proposition and, you know, that if you look at all of the different ways in which you can abate emissions and you put them all on a sort of methane is among the cheapest way to deliver to deliver emissions across the whole spectrum of energy related emissions and that's why it also needs to be a priority from a policy perspective. I wanted to see if I could introduce another question thinking longer term about policy regulation and detection and measurement and I'm just curious to get your thoughts on key areas that should be given special attention by the industry to move the methane reduction needle even further. Is there, we've sort of been touching at it a little bit but are there, you know, what have we not covered that would be worth discussing? Yeah, I can start on this one if you allow me, Trey. I think, well, we've touched some of the some of the topic and the last point made by Tim was very spot on, I believe. The one related to regulation is absolutely critical. We definitely need to have regulation tackling specifically methane emission for the oil and gas industry because you need to get a level playing field and the direction of travel given by the regulator at some stage. So I think that's a very first thing that we definitely need to work on and that's as a GCI we work on with the policymaker and to do that, that means that you have to get some standards across the industry on how you can address the methane, how you're going to detect and mitigate the methane emission and there is a number of initiatives that are going on within this space. OGCI is playing in, we work with IPCA and OGP to develop a set of recommended practice that could be used as a framework and then potentially be getting transformed into or inform the policymaker on how things could be done, the methane getting principle as well as making a tremendous work on this domain, etc. So there is a number of players involved but that needs an alignment across the industries and work with the policymaker to set the appropriate standard on detection, mitigation and then on quantification, reporting, verification, which is the needed level playing field when you have to set up a regulation. And then there is all this work that goes on with engagement with the countries that need to set that up because when you look at the developed countries or some of the countries have already a good climate regulation in place or climate framework that enables those methane regulation to be put in place but actually looking at the other countries where most of the oil and gas industry is extracted, taking into consideration Africa for instance, they may not have this capacity to date and engaging with those countries and explaining what can be done and to allow them to make the leapfrog toward the appropriate regulation straight away and the appropriate policy is probably something that's here again, the group of oil and gas industry like OGCI can do. And then there is the last point I would say where the industry could put their eyes on is obviously what we said earlier, the technology and what the technology can bring between the traditional technology like the laser or the optical gas imaging, like infrared camera or the emerging technologies like again the aircraft and satellite and others, all those combination of technology could probably bring a lot to the industry and scaling them up is quite important. Recently for instance our investment firm OGCI CI made a major call for projects that is still ongoing, actually it's been launched last week I believe to make a call for commercial projects to happen and so we're ready to invest in those to scale up and bring to the volume effect. So yeah focusing on technology is another area where I feel we can bring a lot. That's excellent. I would add to this that I'm blessed to be in a jurisdiction that takes us seriously. In Alberta here we have a very good regulator that has directives out there that very specifically lay out the flaring, the incinerating, the venting and the measurement. Our fellow provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan do the same so I'm blessed but I suddenly have an obligation as an SPE member, as a citizen of the world, we have an obligation to spread that technology globally and it's groups like my fellow panel members here that that are doing such an excellent job of rolling out the best practices to the world. So I'm in a funny space, I'm thankful but the obligation grows for us to get it out there to everybody else and it's so important to have a strong regulatory framework that's meaningful and reasonable and practical. It's interesting building on a comment that Darcy had made earlier that bankers are going to make this easier and I agree with that. The investment community is moving much faster than let's say other areas to put pressure and to cause change but I think this is an interesting point this participant is making. Money moves at the speed of trust and I know trust is a big issue for the industry so the question is how do we become more trustworthy and then be seen to be more trustworthy on the methane emission issue? It's like if you could solve that one you could probably tie a Gregorian knot but it's a really fundamental challenge for the industry. Yeah I would say by having been more robust, accurate, transparent with their data and setting targets and delivering on those I think we've come back to that many times but I think it's fair to say many of our members participate either in OGCI or in this oil and gas methane partnership and they're just bringing in this what they're calling the gold standard, the 2.0 reporting framework which is very much five different levels and if you work towards the highest levels four and five there you know that is very much something that is probably going to be launched this summer and it's something that you know a lot of people are being encouraged to sign up to and meet and this will help you know the data and the emissions to be much more accurate and will involve as Julien has already touched on you know not just the bottom-up estimations and measurements but also the top-down reconciliation and I think you know that will help build the trust because the top-down you know will be data collected you know by others or it will be data that you know is sort of cross-checking so I think all of that will help to build the trust but yeah I think we're on the right track in some of this but there's a way to go for sure. You know so SPE is the Society of Petroleum Engineers and I frequently hear with this society that you know we know a lot, we know a lot about the geology, we know a lot about the technology that's being deployed to produce these resources and so I think within the industry there's a belief that we have a high level of competence in this subject and there's a relationship between your competence and trust and it's just trans you know getting through the barriers really to have your competence be able to be trusted and I think that's a challenge for the industry and it's also a situation where we have you know the need to listen and be very very intently listening to make sure that we're understanding what we need to do and I think that's a little bit of a shift because also we may have a tendency to not listen as carefully. I think that is changing right now significantly and I think as evidence I don't think the CEO statements that I alluded to earlier in that one of our initial questions those these are not quest"
"SPE President's Podcast with Terry Palisch: ""Creating Our Energy Future"" - Maximizing Your Membership by Leveraging SPE'S Multimedia Content - March 2024","Hi everybody and welcome. It's a beautiful spring day here in Houston, but our oil and gas industry is being battered by an almighty perfect storm. The double impact of COVID-19 demand collapse and a nasty supply cut overhang from the OPEC plus debacle has left our industry in a real mess. So today in our panel session, we want to be looking behind the headlines of the impact on the current situation on our workforce. So that's you, our viewers. So over the next 40 minutes or so, as David mentioned, we have four expert panelists that will be joining us to talk about various aspects of the current situation. We have Susan House, VP of engineering at subsurface consultants and associates. Susan will be talking about layoffs and workforce in transition. We have Christian Spitzmuller, professor of industrial and organisational psychology at the University of Houston. She'll be talking about her research on the energy workforce outlook on COVID-19. Diane Chadwick-Jones from BP. She is the human performance director at BP and she'll be talking about how companies like BP are putting mental health and employee wellbeing in the balance. And finally, Tom Willard, principal partner at environmental resources management will be talking to us about the challenges of returning to work and managing that risk. It's at the forefront of many discussions currently. So obviously it's very important that we also try and address that. So with no further ado, I'm going to turn to Susan. So Susan, you've been core SP volunteering for many, many years in the Gulf Coast section and you've been working very centrally with the members in transition. Please tell us more about this programme and what its importance and how it's helping. Thanks, Niels. We launched the members in transition programme about four years ago in the Gulf Coast section and we cover all sorts of career topics, job search, career transition, entrepreneurship, innovation. And one of the key elements of our programme is a monthly seminar series with usually three or four different speakers. We have a webinar series due to COVID-19. We're only doing it virtually and we're having the speakers broadcast from our homes. But our next event is actually open for registration now. It's May 8th, so that's a couple of weeks away. And the speakers will be talking about cloud-based skills, how to start a company, the mentoring journey and preparing for unemployment. And so we find that when we are able to have these meetings face to face, it provides a great opportunity for networking. So we hope to be able to return to a conference room soon. But right now they're available for virtual interaction. We're also planning a career fair, a hiring event for upstream oil and gas professionals. We had one scheduled for March and we have postponed that until September. But 13 of the employers that had already registered are carrying forward with us until September. And so we will start the planning for that event in a conference call on May 15th. So volunteers are welcome to join. We have a number of discounted opportunities for members in transition in the Gulf Coast section because we want people to keep active in their SP membership. There's great resources that are available on our website, books and websites and all sorts of other resources. And in fact, some recordings of our previous seminars are available there too. And we have a job board so people can post their resumes and they can look for jobs that are posted there. That's really positive. So, you know, obviously the industry layoffs and the furloughs are impacting more than just SPE members. Can you say a little bit about how you're expanding the program to other associations? Absolutely. Well, we've been collaborating with more than 20 different professional societies on our hiring event and the APG recently approached us to expand this program to other cities in North America. And so in fact, we had a planning meeting last week where we're looking to expand to Midland, Odessa, which is the Permian Basin section for SPE and to Denver. And so we'll be collaborating with APG and perhaps other professional societies. And we really think this is best done locally because you can get local speakers, you can have opportunities for universities or faith-based communities or even local government agencies that can provide employment support. And so we would like to see this spread to different parts of the world. Yeah, I was about to say, you know, obviously the, I mean, many viewers may ask, well, you know, this is just sort of very American-centric and it's partly the nature of the American oil and gas industry that ramps up very quickly, employs a lot of people. And then in the current situation, it ramps down very quickly and a lot of people lose their jobs. But obviously the tools and the information that's available for members in transition, so the people that have been laid off is available and important for other people in other locations in the world. So, you know, they can access some of this information or a lot of this information through the SPE website, right? Absolutely. We have a page for the Gulf Coast section and there's a page for our committee that has resources there. We also wrote a paper that we delivered at the annual technical conference exhibition a couple of years ago about how to start one of these. And in that paper, we gathered some of the best practices for conducting a job search. In many cases, a job seeker who may be quarantined right now can get started on the process of thinking about their skills and competencies and how to best portray their brand as they're looking for a job search. And they can also be conducting research on the companies that they want to approach. We're finding in Houston that many of the companies that are hiring are smaller companies and they may have started up within the past 10 years. And so you're going to want to learn about them. And so contacting individuals who work there or perhaps doing research about how they started and what their product lines are is a great way to spend your time while you're in quarantine. You also want to think about how you're going to use your network because we all know the best way to land a job is to use your network to do that. So reach out to your contacts and let them know that you're in job search mode and make sure that you expand beyond your immediate circle of friends to perhaps colleagues that you haven't talked to a while and get back in touch with some of your former colleagues. Perhaps they'll be willing to give you references. And so it's a great time to do that legwork. Now while we're stuck at home, you can do that research and you actually might be able to catch someone on the phone if you call them. Yeah, that's really great advice. I mean, obviously, maybe this situation is a good opportunity for people to refocus and decide if they want to move in a different direction in their careers. And as you say, this is that opportunity they can look through and do research as to where they want to go next. And maybe, can you say a little bit about what maybe some of the newer skills that employers are looking for in the current workforce? Absolutely. Well, data analytics is certainly an area of interest for many job seekers. There are a number of opportunities to get skills in that area. And so you might want to be looking at taking some online classes, learning some software skills, perhaps get a certificate. Maybe you want to get your PE license or a PMP certification. There's lots of opportunities right now to enhance your skills. Within SPE, of course, we have the SP Connect community. So you can reach out and find out where the jobs are with your colleagues there. There's SPE mentoring. We have virtual sections. They're called technical sections that you can collaborate with your colleagues in certain disciplines. And of course, right now, there's a special in one petro. You can get all those technical. Yeah, that's right. Five dollar price. So it's a great opportunity. So watch some of those webinars that are free for SP members and learn about some of the areas where you might want to advance your skills. And perhaps it's something in the area of business leadership and management skills that you might use to enhance your technical confidence. That's great. Thank you. Just one final question before we move on to Christian. Are you seeing any similarities or differences with the current downturn compared with, say, 2014-15, apart from obviously the travel restrictions and the social distancing? I think the challenge with this downturn as compared to previous downturns is usually our advice to job seekers is get out of the house, go meet people for coffee, go to an SPE meeting, attend a conference. And you can't do that right now. You're constrained. And so now's the time to reach out virtually, use email and social media and pick up the phone and contact your colleagues that you've worked with in the past and plan ahead for times when we return to work. But now's the time that you can conduct your job search literally from your house. Okay. Thank you, Susan. We'll come back to you later on in the broadcast. Want more insights from today's conversation? SPE Publications cover all aspects of the upstream oil and gas industry, from technology and careers to production and operations. Learn more about our peer-reviewed journals, magazines, books, technical papers and technical reports. It's all at spe.org publications. I'm going to move on to Christian now. Thank you very much. Christian, obviously this time anxiety, uncertainty and fear, stress are significant amongst the workforce. Your expertise in industrial and organizational psychology. And last week you presented a really excellent University of Houston webinar along with PESA and Pink Petro about your recent research on worry and appreciation in the energy workforce regarding COVID-19. Can you say a little bit more about this work? Absolutely. So like many of you, you know, we were wondering what's going on in the energy industry. I mean, we hear, and I think Susan has provided some great comments about job insecurity and how we manage job insecurity in these days and layoffs. So we wanted to know, so what exactly are the numbers like? What is the energy workforce experiencing? And what are policy implications for employers who are currently helping their workforce transition through this truly unique time? So one way that we wanted to see that was through a survey study. So we surveyed more than 450 people with an international research team, partnering with Ramana and Krishna Moody at the University of Houston and Rona Flynn in Aberdeen. And there's a few things we wanted to look at. One of them was, is this crisis truly different from prior ones? I think all of us who've dealt with energy workforce issues for many years are used to, like Niels is elaborating on, the boom and bust cycles that are part of this industry. So we asked people how they felt about the long-term prospects of this industry. And we also took a look at, so people who are much older, who've been in the industry longer, do they feel differently about this crisis than people who only recently entered? So in other words, has the experience with prior shocks prepared people for the current experience? And the answer to that is no, that this is really truly unprecedented for people who've been in the industry for a very long time, as well as obviously for people who joined more recently. What we also took a close look at is, so what do employees think about how their employers on average have handled this crisis? And interestingly, the reactions were much more positive, even than we had expected. So they were close to 90% of employees who said their employers indeed have been pretty effective in managing this situation and helping them through it. So we took a closer look, running some data analyses, examining what exactly do companies do where employees feel they're highly effective in managing this crisis and in helping employees through it. And we found that three factors really indeed matter. The first one is whether the company had provided clear and honest, transparent information. The second one was how they helped manage the work-family interface. And the third one is really how the company had previously prepared for a global pandemic. So what are some of the effective policies that you identified from this survey? So among them are there are vast differences in how companies communicate with their employees, how much information about business continuity and crisis management plans they share with employees. Our findings suggest that indeed from a policy perspective, the best practice is to focus, and I know we always say that, on first-line supervisors' skill set in helping employees navigate the incredibly challenging work-family interface issues that we're seeing right now. Many of us have children hopping in the background today. Many of us have older parents who've moved to a more remote area, or who have moved to a more remote area. Many of us have children hopping in the background today. Many of us have older parents who've moved in with us because nursing homes are no longer safe places at this day and time. So employers that have trained their first-line supervisors to be understanding of these issues, provide the needed flexibility and the support, are much more successful in navigating the transition. That's very encouraging to hear. Can you say a little bit more about, for example, within the sort of context of the wider community, are family work-family conflicts higher in certain sort of groups of workers, or are they uniform across the population? Now women do, even in 2020, bear the brunt of work-family interface issues. And I think in part that is due to different family structures of women who work in energy. So in our survey we asked about the partner's or spouse's employment situation. And what we did find there is that on average a woman energy worker had a spouse who worked 35, 40 hours a week. On average, men in the energy industry had spouses who worked between 10 and 20 or 10, 15 hours a week. So when you look at that, that poses the challenge of truly managing a dual career for many women, while that's not as much the case for men. Yeah, that's interesting to see. So obviously, you know, these kind of work-life balances and stress is going to weigh heavily on many people. Are there indications that people, you know, we in the oil and gas industry, we are very safety conscious? So are there indications that people are concerned about safety now under these present conditions? So we looked at that from two angles in our study, Neil. So the first angle is we had some questions where we asked people whether they had trouble sleeping. You know, trouble sleeping comes with a host of negative psychological and physical health consequences. And among the behavioral consequences is difficulty, you know, staying focused. And we do see that there's a pretty significant portion of the workforce that's reporting trouble sleeping because there's just too many things going on. And then we also ask specific questions, you know, so is your priority on safety in any way affected by this? And what we're finding there is actually pretty encouraging that I think the work that's been done in the industry for decades with regards to building a safe workplace culture, there's always more work to be done and we can't relent on that ever. But I think it's clearly showing that that's a huge emphasis. But that is something that I think needs to be watched very carefully as, you know, as staffing models change, reduction in forces take place and the pressure on individual contributors increases to still get the job done and do it safely. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SPE programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other SPE members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location or experience level. To learn more about the League of Volunteers, visit spe.org. volunteer. So that leads us neatly over to Diane over at BP. So, Diane, just to continue on that note in terms of mental welfare, mental well-being and safety, you know, in your role as Human Performance Director at BP, there's been a lot of work done by BP over many years in terms of the workforce well-being. Can you say a little bit more about what BP's efforts are currently in terms of the current situation, work safety and mental well-being? Thank you, Nils. And these fit very much together. So in BP, what we're doing is we're building upon our existing culture of care. So this culture of care underpins our core value of safety, that we know that our safety actions are most effective when we care about each other, because we're looking out for each other and showing care by listening and helping. And this builds trust, so that we can more easily speak up if something seems wrong. So in these times, you know, when we're scared for our loved ones and our livelihood, and we're coping with extreme change and uncertainty, we're all touched by some sort of mental health issue. Whether it's me or my family or my colleagues, it's all around us. So looking out for each other and trusting each other to talk about problems is vital. And so what we're doing is we're making talking about mental health to be a mainstream conversation, to make it okay to say, I'm having a hard time, or I'm having a dip in well-being. It's okay to show vulnerability, you won't be judged. And it also helps to see change as a process. I found the Kubler-Ross change curve to be useful in making sense of this. So there's defined stages like denial, anger, depression, which is a big dip, acceptance, and we all go through these stages, it's normal. Of course, we shouldn't assume that everyone is having a tough time. But also, we shouldn't assume that everyone is fine, since the whole world is coming to terms with the changes we're facing. So change affects all of us. And let me talk a bit about how it has affected me. So when we were starting the UK lockdown, I started to feel overwhelmed, and I couldn't concentrate because I was worrying. And what would usually take me about 10 minutes to do would take me about an hour. And my colleagues assumed that I was really busy, but actually, in reality, I was in a kind of a frozen state. However, when I realized what was going on, I knew I had to speak up to somebody who cared for me, who wouldn't judge me. And I told two of my colleagues, and I felt like a big weight had been lifted. I shared my worries. I gave myself some space to process the big changes that were happening. And I came out the other side of this dip in well-being. Part of it was just speaking up. Part of it was putting less pressure on myself, and part of it was focusing on doing the small things that I could control. And in fact, I started telling more people about this. And many said that they were feeling overwhelmed and frozen, too, and that it was helpful to know that other people were feeling the same. And that's what inspired me to share today. Yes, we're all having a tough time, but we can support each other through a culture of care. And so I think kind of in summary, you know, we're in the middle of a mental health crisis. Everyone's affected. There are things that we can do to deal with this. Speaking with others is a really important step. And fostering a culture of care in our teams allows people to speak about issues freely. And it really now is a time to check in on others. That's a really important message to get across to people. And perhaps sort of the silver lining in all of this is that social media has exploded. So people are much more accepting of talking to each other over social media. And in terms of mental health, I mean, to misquote Thomas Jefferson for a moment, all men and women are created equal. But in terms of mental health, we're not all equal, right? We, you know, we react in different ways to different or to the same stressful situations. So as you say, it's very important to reach out and communicate and talk to our work colleagues to make sure that they are well and are coping and that they can openly talk about some things. Yeah, we actually do have some structures in place as well. So in support of our culture of care, we have employees have access to 24 seven confidential employee assistance program, which is also open to family members. We've given free access to the Headspace app, which has meditation and sleep tools. And of course, we have our local health teams providing specific support as and when needed. So, you know, we've made a donation to mine the mental health charity in the UK. And also our CEO and chairman have actually donated 20% of their salary to mental health charities. So we're, we're really trying to bring this to the forefront and having it as an everyday conversation, rather than something that in the past may have had some sort of stigma. That's really welcome contribution and sort of evolution in our sort of corporate management and workforce welfare engagement. So emotional intelligence is obviously something very important, both for our leaders, but also for the workforce themselves to actually be able to develop those skills and understand their own emotional intelligence. I'm just going to quickly pass over to Susan again and ask Susan, you know, emotional intelligence, is this something a soft skill amongst other soft skills that could be important for people to think about developing in this transition period? Yeah, absolutely. There are some great resources on emotional intelligence, several good books, and, and Harvard Business Review has some resources. I think we had some of those resources posted on the SELF section, Members in Transition page, because a lot of times, you know, your, your personality is as important as your technical skills. When, when you're looking for employment, you want to find a place where you'll fit in well, and you want to find a group of people that you respect and that respect you. And I like what Diane was saying about reaching out to people when you're experiencing a down day, because I think for a lot of people in job search, supporting each other is a great way to raise your spirits. And so anytime, you might be able to help someone to find a job lead that might not be right for you, but it might be right for your colleagues. So it's great to support each other.

I'm going to move on to Tomna, who's been patiently sitting on the end of our virtual couch. So returning to work, we had a question in from the audience. The state of Georgia is about to open up its business activities again within the next 24 to 48 hours. There's questions about what's the rest of the United States going to be doing, what's going to be happening in the oil and gas industry. So Tom, obviously a very emotive time in terms of returning to work. Tell us more about what you're doing and your experiences and what you're seeing about how companies are trying to manage this risk of returning to work. Sure. Thanks, Nelson. And thanks for inviting me to share some thoughts on this. So what I thought I'd do is talk a little bit about where we've been for the last 12 weeks, then talk about some of the dilemmas that our clients and we are facing in bringing the workforce back into the workplace, and then talk a little bit about how they're doing that, how they're bringing their employees back into the workplace and managing the risks. So just, you know, we have been, you know, we work globally. So we have been working on this for the last 12 weeks, started in China working as part of COVID-19 response teams mid-January in a range of sectors, so healthcare, retail, extractives. And initially we were tracking the virus, tracking employees, tracking government regulations and via apps and companies were asking us to, you know, predict where it was going to go next. And then that shifted to sort of enterprise-wide risk management, business continuity planning and developing operating procedures for those essential facilities and those essential workers that had to work all the way through the pandemic. But just in the last two weeks, and I don't know whether this is a ray of sunshine for everyone, we've been flooded with requests for return to work. Can you help us manage the return to work process and help us minimize the exposure risks of our employees? So it's a really interesting time globally. We, you know, some, you know, some workers are protesting because they're desperate to get back to work and others are protesting because they don't feel they're being adequately protected in the workplace. And in terms of, you know, health and safety, the rules haven't changed. Leaders have to do three things, provide a safe workplace, provide workers with the tools and training and guidance to work safe and then, you know, monitor that work is being done safely. But the complicating factor here is the, we're still learning about the virus, we're still learning about the hazard, about the behavior of the virus itself, its virulence, its prevalence, the best means of control and therefore, and also the guidance from governments and from the scientific sources is kind of confusing and sometimes contradictory. So it's a whole lot more difficult. So just briefly, just and lastly, so what are our clients doing? So some of them are planning to get back to work so that they're making sure they've got the best available scientific information, the legal information. Some of them are developing, if you like, operational playbooks. So these are new sets of instructions on how to deliver those operations through social, you know, but, you know, with different shift patterns, screening and testing and social spacing and cleaning and enforcement, all trying to do it in a COVID constrained environment. So some of them are planning, some of them are developing, if you like, a new operational playbook and training their employees and others have actually got their workforce back in the workplace and are just monitoring very, very carefully. And for those clients, it's a case of sharing very rapidly what's going well and what's not, because clearly, it's just all the usual hazards, but with a couple more uncertain hazards thrown in. Yeah, that's very interesting. So obviously, you know, many business leaders are having to balance the equation of risk management, risk aversion in a way versus continuity of business. So, and, you know, oil and gas, we, in many locations in Texas, other states from the United States, but other countries, oil and gas workers are seen as essential employees. So they are at work in the workplace. At the same time, oil and gas companies have a lot of people either laid off or furloughed or working from home in isolation. So that adds a complexity to the picture. So in terms of risk management, how is that, you know, how is that going to be managed getting these different groups together again? Well, I mean, you know, the companies we're working for, all I can say is, not easy because, particularly because, first of all, there's gaps in the workforce, there are, some work, workers have been laid off, others are sick, so won't be coming back to work. And in other cases, there's a lot of cross skilling needed to be done, because we need more of this kind of skill and less of that kind of skill. So actually, plugging the gaps, and is one thing, plugging the skills gaps is one thing, and actually retraining people is another. And then, you know, actually, what's your contingency? So if you're working in shifts or in pods, and one pod gets an infected worker, then that group of people have to be quarantined. So you have to have a backup. So this is doable. It's absolutely doable. And again, I'm not just talking about oil and gas, I'm talking across sectors, but it needs to be incredibly well planned, with very clear instructions, extremely good training. And, you know, the usual sort of hierarchy of risk control has to be applied. So if you can eliminate the hazard by doing something automated or remotely, or engineering controls with partitions and ventilation, and then you've got, you know, administrative controls, and actually, your last resort is actually PPE. So the strange thing is, is everyone's desperately chasing PPE. But actually, if you just apply normal risk management processes to trying to, you know, eliminate engineer out and administrative controls, it's not all about do we have the PPE to last to get back to work. But many, you know, many organizations are planning to get their workforce back to work quickly. And there will obviously be commercial advantages to doing that. But you need to have the test kits, sorry, you need to have the test kits, and you need to have the screening, and you need to have the systems in place, and you need to use technology to enable your workforce to work safely in the new normal. Yeah, I really liked your point there about it's not all about PPE, but it's about proper processes. And a very significant part of that is the communication of those processes and the procedures that are about to take place to the workforce. What can the workforce do to support their management? We heard from Christian earlier that the workforce have been, from her survey, the workforce has seen generally very positive to how management have dealt with the situation currently. But what can the workforce do to support their management in this situation? So, well, in some, I talked about a sort of operating playbook in some of the companies we're working for, the workforce is actually developing that playbook. They're coming up with the ideas of how to do social spacing, how to do proper screening, how to, you know, they're actually involved in developing the solution so that they're involved in working in this new normal situation, coming up with ideas. And actually, that's obviously when it comes from the frontline, those are going to be most exposed to the hazard, the virus, getting their feedback and input to this process is incredibly important. The other thing is, so helping design, if you like, the new playbook. The other thing is actually, and it's been said earlier, you know, the cross skilling. So, we've got clients that haven't got enough truck drivers, so they're retraining bus drivers to become truck drivers. You know, there's a real, it's that there are gaps in workforces that, you know, it's very volatile and there are plenty of gaps opening up. So, re-skilling and cross-skilling and learning new skills is vitally important. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm going to bring in Diane and Christian here at this point. So, Diane, Christian, from your perspectives, return to work. Just briefly, what are your observations about what Tom said and just generally returning to work? Diane first, maybe. Well, I think it's all about keeping people safe, isn't it? So, we've got, you know, a huge amount of effort in this area with changing the schedules, social distancing, testing. You know, it is between the operations team and the health team, this is a massive effort. And it's something that's, you know, I think quite phased. I think that's the important thing is to think that, you know, that this isn't going to be over soon and that how we're looking at it is, you know, how do we think about this in a measured way as a long marathon rather than something that's going to be quickly resolved? Thank you. Christian, you know, in your research work, are you going to be looking at how the, you know, the return to work aspect? Yeah, in fact, we have a partnership on a second phase of our study that is launching this coming Monday, where we're specifically looking at the return to work. And again, we've built partnerships with some industry associations to"
SPE President‚Äôs Podcast with Terry Palisch: ‚ÄùCreating Our Energy Future‚Äù - November 2023,"I'm Jason Notouris and this is SPE Talks to Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SPE podcast. If you haven't subscribed yet, we encourage you to do so. Great way to keep up with the latest oil and gas technical trends and valuable information. As is our monthly tradition 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan joins us in studio to discuss her column. Thanks for being here. It's great to be here and I'm even more excited to be here because today is Bring Your Mother to Work Day. That's right, an extra special guest Irene Freeman, better known to you Shana as Mom. Yes, my mom is visiting us from Vancouver, Canada and again trying to get the work-life balance and being able to do my SPE obligations as well as spend time with my mother. I brought her along while doing these podcasts but it's very timely because my February column is all about mentoring and the one person that really influenced me the most in the mentorship and let's say she was very good at offering constructive criticism was my mom. Well then let's switch things up a bit Shana because you've been here for a few episodes I think you can take the reins on this. How about you go ahead and host the first segment of this episode with Your Mom is the Guest because as you mentioned your February column does break down that two-way street of mentor and mentee in the relationship there and honestly parents play a pivotal role in this arena so take it away. Host Shana Noonan. All right well this is um it's like a double-edged sword because I finally get to interview my mother but yet I'm also very fearful what's gonna come out of her mouth so let's see how this goes. My mother spent what you do about 39 years yes and I'm also proud to mention that my mom was actually recognized by the Prime Minister of Canada for excellence in teaching and when we talk about the digital revolution impact now my mother was very instrumental in Canada with bringing computers into the classrooms especially into for early education so mom how how was that because you were leading the charge in something that a lot of people didn't want to do. I taught a lot of teachers what to do in their classrooms with students in a computer lab and I you were talking about mentoring I felt that that's probably most of my mentoring was with other teachers who in turn would talk to their children and deal with their classes in computer science. When I think of all the different mentoring or items that you taught me too was you were always a working mother oh yes and you know trying to raise both my brother and I and still making sure that we're getting our piano lessons oh yes I hate to say us but I my mother had me in tap and baton classes my I was temporarily a twirler you were also in baseball or Yes and so how because not only you'd be teaching during the day you spent a lot of time in the evenings having to be grading paper setting up for classroom and you just served as a really good example making sure that both my brother and I we not only gave attention to school because we grew up in a house that academics were very much a priority but you were able to do both and okay his question to you was what was really the most difficult? Oh the most difficult was being able to do the work when you talk about the work-life balance. There were times when I had to put aside my work to deal with family commitments and I really felt like sometimes I was on a balancing wheel trying to decide which was the right way to go hopefully I chose the right path. You did and but I know there was times when you know I could see the stress and I know my brother and I would look at each other and go oh my god mom's got cuckoo for cocoa puffs but then I see that too so like I when I start thinking that's the way I look to my own children then you know I try and try and make corrections for that now I'm gonna speak in making corrections and I'm gonna totally change questions on you because we grew up in a household that we had other than a few cousins that were maybe operators out in the field in oil and gas we really didn't have anybody in the family that was even in engineering or in oil and gas and when I entered university I was actually in pre-med engineering wasn't even in my sights and then I remember after the second year that phoning my mother and telling her that by the way I'm now in petroleum engineering so how did you take that? I was surprised but it's been wonderful for her she's chosen the right path we figured my husband and I both felt that she's done much better in this than she ever would in medicine. So mom I again I just I want to thank you very much for you've gone just beyond being a mother again this is and even being you know the educator with you know making sure we're always focused on STEM but again it was just more rounding us out as to just to be better individuals and better contributors and I really I'm a better parent because I had such a good one. Well thank you. All right I'm back and that goes down it's one of my favorite guest spots in the early history of this podcast because we are talking about mentors today and parents play such a great role in that and we get to learn things about people when parents come on podcasts that we didn't previously know so in the January column Shawna you were really focusing on strengthening the feedstock of incoming talent in the industry you're kind of building on that this month. I definitely am Jason I've already talked about the importance of attracting and retaining the talent that we need in this industry this month I wanted to focus on the importance of training those bright young minds and training through mentoring. When I talk about mentoring I'm focusing more on how to be more effective and impactful when mentoring somebody. Now as I'm you know reflecting again on my goals for the new year I don't just use the first week in January to start setting goals I really you know use actually the first several months to really strengthen and think about not only the the important things that I need to do but it's made me reflect on how the importance of people not only help teach me how to set great goals but also provided the support and guidance with achieving those goals. Well I had some people in my career actually assigned to be my mentor probably some of the ones that were the most impactful the ones that did it more informally while providing advice and when it and advice it's more constructive criticism during really opportune moments and it didn't matter how they became my mentor the key point is that they were. Now there's coaching at a technical level again you know the importance of academia in making sure that we have those fundamentals but just as important is the coaching in the development of an individual to have all the skills needed to navigate and excel in their industry and that is just as important. Now for 2020 you know my goals include elements of being both a mentor and a Now while I have much to contribute to our younger members I also have a lot to learn and I want to encourage more of my colleagues to set goals around mentoring and I want to make this the month where we take time also to recognize and thank those who've made a positive impact on ourselves as mentors. You know during my travels and getting a chance to meet so many of the young professionals and students around the globe there are so many out there that they know they need and they're looking for people to mentor them so again I'm really trying to encourage more of our SPE members to reach out and mentor others but then you know we want to make sure that we were good mentors as well. Now Jason you know reflecting back did you have anybody or several people that you can think made a difference in mentoring you? No absolutely I think for me it started with my parents my mom my dad people always ask me who do you confide in the most who's your best friend and without hesitation I say my dad half of the time they both taught me great life lessons they both looked out for me but they let me make mistakes and learn from them but they were there to coach me along the way when I needed that. Professionally I would say starting in college I'm gonna give a few shoutouts I feel like an award speech to play the music if I need to get off stage Jason Coma, Sherry Russo, Keith Colley, Tony Castro Cone then getting started Drew Hadwall my first boss really looked out for me helped teach me a lot of ethics that I think were very important and then for some some co-workers at SPE Glenda Smith and Dana Otilio have both been there for me and provided excellent insights so mentors are there if you look for them some will come and seek you and and you have to have open ears and an open heart to be able to accept what they're offering one place that I've been asked to be a mentor myself has been on LinkedIn this is an option you can select in your profile page and I have had a few people who are just starting out their careers where I feel I can add a decade's worth of advice to them and I'll give them that letting them know this is a decade's worth of advice this isn't the this may not be the end-all solution but this is what I can tell you from what I've experienced and I would just encourage people to pursue routes like that where they can give back but also be willing to look out for yourself as well you know it's funny when looking back and realizing the influence that people had in the fact that they were actually mentoring now I've already mentioned and we had the conversation earlier in the podcast with my mother and you mentioned your father and my father actually mentored me with four words because anytime I would go and ask dad something for feedback or anything he would always say go ask your mother we all don't necessarily seek out criticism we always like to be told you know how great we are and that was always one thing I would too I would go to dad because dad was more of the the easier one but again he was able to force me to get that constructive feedback by basically directing all of my questions over over to my mom moms are always right anyways so I guess that that makes sense what about on a professional level mentors that you had there that helped shape your career where you are now when I first started as a young engineer working the rigs there was one individual who was tasked with mentoring all the young engineers that were supervising rigs along with me in northern Alberta and you know I now realize that the phoning in of our morning reports like it was one of the most fearful things starting out because there was always criticism with what we were doing as to you know whether it was the logistics we had you know why was the frat crew waiting for several hours you know again it's all things that you're learning but you know phoning into his name was Don Patterson and you know he spent many many years mentoring young engineers at Chevron and you know looking back all his critiques yeah they were necessary but they're also really good constructive feedback and you know I then I wasn't looking at it as someone was coaching and mentoring me I just saw it was someone that was you know basically making me feel I was everything that I was doing was wrong but now I want to give him a shout out because he was one of an influential mentor another mentor for me when I was working at Chevron was an engineer by the name of Fred Brownlee both him and then also John Patterson a conical Phillips they were two of my most influential mentors technically and then for connecting me with industry peers helping me expand my network now Fred actually he also taught me how to do effective email writing he always would teach me that you never phrase an email where someone can quickly respond with no you know you worded as to hey if I if unless I hear unless I hear different from you I'm gonna proceed and do this and this and this and this you know just little things like that that help you just be a lot more effective and then also to John Patterson he always he always taught me always keep asking why you know why did this happen well then you know a lot of it had to do with root cause failure analysis which is something I did a lot in my career but then always really trying to get down to the root I actually sought out John Patterson as a mentor and that was one of the reasons why I end up coming to Conoco Phillips was I had a chance to work with one of the most influential and industry experts in artificial lift at the time so thank you very much for that John and Fred and I still keep in contact with them quite regularly and then when it came to being a manager I really have to give a shout out to one of my former supervisors at Conoco Phillips Mike Mooney who recently retired he not only taught me how to do effective employee assessments and you know basically in engage and inspire direct reports he actually forced me to do it as well I always thought my career path it was going to be strictly technical and I tried to avoid at all points having anybody report up to me and make me go the management track because that wasn't my goal but again to having an effective mentor and boss he saw that I really needed to round out that element first it was approached I'm gonna assign you two young engineers that you can mentor and you know they'll be your direct reports and next thing I know and I had I had a whole team reporting to me which is which was really really good and he one of the most things that he did for me as well was to teach me on how to stay focused on value-adding goals and that's one thing when I travel with SP in talking to young professionals is making sure that what they're trying to accomplish is adding value to the company and I say and it has to add up in barrels or in dollars because that's the only thing that management has and it's it's a question I'll ask the audience is okay how many of you right now in this room can say with dollars and barrels the value you're adding to the company and out of all the talks that I did last month there was only one individual raise their hand but then I also add ask after that saying okay now if you did know those numbers does your management know the value that you're bringing so again that was Mike Mooney being a woman in oil and gas it's a little bit more challenging to have or find mentors that are women and I really want to give a shout out to Karen Draper and Carol Magni Grandi now both these women ran well Karen's retired she ran SNM pump company and Carol still runs Magni Grandi and they provided mentorship on how to succeed in this industry as a working mother as a leader they invited me years and years ago to serve on the SBEs golf co-section ESP workshop and I see in those women now because they really helped mentor me as a working mother they are present when I actually had my children and my daughters referred to both those women as their fairy godmothers which is uh you know still fun to this day and then finally I would not be talking in this podcast I would not be writing columns for JPT as SP president if it wasn't for Dr. Jeff Spath who was the 2014 president I first met Jeff when I came on the board as a technical director so as president you get to pick who gets to lead the the board committees and he had selected me to run the meetings committee at the time it was meetings and training and I had managed to do that for two years and it really actually let me see the impact or contribution I could have with serving with these higher roles and I wouldn't even thought of being able to serve as the president if he hadn't not only encouraged me but nominated me and he's been my mentor all along as well so to this day I really I would not be here if it wasn't for Jeff and his mentorship well it's really interesting when you mention everyone a lot of people focus so much on the timeline of their career through the roles that they've held at different companies you could also build into that the people who helped you achieve those roles or helped your career growth it could be the same timeline it could be a separate timeline but all these people do equate to career growth even though they're contributing in different ways you're very right Jason and the fact that we need different mentors at different places in our career and own personal development and for me when I'm setting out my goals I do look ahead to see that do I have the right mentors to help me succeed and do I need to be expanding on that while you need the different people different times in your life they all really still need to have the common attribute that they're a good mentor in the first place you know they need to be interested in my success and they need to listen and to guide and not to dictate now I did have one poor mentor early in my career who not only dictated what I should do he thought that his career path should be my career path and so that was a very poor mentorship that pretty much fizzled earlier on now all these great mentors that I had they also saw what my potential was more so than myself and then they challenged me to realize it and you know there's so many more individuals I've just mentioned if you hear that I've also mentioned in my column there's been so many wonderful mentors that I'm going to be making this month of February more of recognize your mentor month so I'm going to be doing that for myself but then also too I'm going to be trying to encourage our members and thank you Jason for letting us know who your mentors were but also to well when we reward and recognize those have been an influence hopefully well one you know obviously they get the recognition for what they've done but also to just to encourage other people to follow suit there's more that goes beyond to just being a mentor because the thing is okay I've talked about being a good mentor but at the same time someone the mentee also has to be a good mentee and the relationship between the two I actually use the term symbiotic in the fact that okay the mentor has to be able to provide that constructive criticism but then the mentee must be open to receiving it and not only receive it but be willing to make necessary changes and commit to the actions needed to change there's been a few examples when I've talked to some of our young professionals and they have said that oh I had this person as my mentor and you know they weren't a very good mentor and when we get into conversations you know it comes down to actually that person is really giving great constructive feedback but unfortunately you weren't willing to hear it you wanted more of a relationship to be given the pat on the back saying good job good job and because this mentor was actually giving you some advice on things that needed to change and you didn't necessarily hear it you then equated that to being that person being a bad mentor and that's that's absolutely not the case and there's a there's a great quote from Andrew Carnegie that I included in the JPT column and it's you can't push anyone up the ladder unless they're willing to climb it themselves absolutely because the mentor can provide that support that can be the pat on the back but what do you do with that support if it's just there to help you have that extra glow then you're not really evolving your career you're not taking new directions you're not building off the advice to try and reach success or goal maybe you need it for motivation there are all these different facets of how both sides can take advantage of the mentorship-ness but it just depends on whether or not you're open to it and that's the hardest thing I think for people just starting out into any type of mentorship program to really grasp is that it can be rewarding but not in the everyone gets a trophy type of rewarding more in the you being able and being willing to adapt and accept change if you need to not everyone has to change so I just think that's a good point that you bring up that you're not gonna I mean there needs to be a ladder to begin with too before you can even want to climb the ladder before someone can give you that push there needs to be a ladder so there are so many steps and evolutions into the mentorship that it's just so interesting to think about because you can also have it in different durations right it doesn't have to be this this one week thing or one month thing or one year thing or maybe it's a lifetime relationship being a mentor mentee I totally agree it's you can either be short term or long term but I want to again with the constructive criticism in that you know I think it's going to be more challenging for us to teach our younger members how to be good mentees to accept that constructive criticism because we do have a whole generation that are looking for the pad on the back and I go back to one of my very first mentors I mentioned earlier on Don Patterson and again you know it was fearful to be calling in those morning reports knowing that we were getting that criticism but actually I think it was probably pretty strategic and it could have been a strategy with Chevron at the time was making sure that the younger engineers that were coming in were getting that not only getting it but learning how to take that constructive feedback and I think this is something that we really need to be doing as an industry with a whole generation of you know they're sending me notes on LinkedIn as to you know can SPE please expand award recognition or you know acknowledgments again it's looking more and more for these pats on the back so that's it's gonna be a little bit yeah it's gonna be a little bit challenging well into your note also we may not know that we have a mentor until after the fact it may be something that doesn't sink in until maybe five ten years later oh that person was a great mentor and this is what they taught me I just didn't realize it at the time so I think that's also another interesting takeaway I know I've had a couple of experiences like that before where I thought at the time this person is just being a pain they're just trying to make my life difficult and then you take that step back away from yourself and look at that overarching view of what's best for the company and you realize oh no they were actually helping me and I've without realizing it slowly changed and adapted to accept some of these practices which long term are much better off for me than maybe what I was doing at the time okay you mentioned that you know five ten years looking back you know realizing the what that person had done well first of all I hope you end up reaching out and letting those people know because they might make they may have not even realized then too that they're being an effective mentor being able to know that you actually were able to influence and make change in somebody is why I love it with my mentoring to be in it for the long haul because I get the most satisfaction to witness that growth and the change and so you know I personally will commit for whatever time period it takes to to see that and also to make sure that they stay in the right direction that you know the the corrections of the feedback it was actually something that was sustainable and actually one of my most rewarding experiences as a mentor had nothing to do with the oil and gas industry but actually it I use elements of it in my job but it was as leader of a local Girl Scout troop you know that's where I honed my skills around encouraging others to get out of their comfort zone and to learn a new skill and work as a team and these young girls I first had them in in the United States they start out as daisies in in Girl Scouts oh and by the way I myself personally I was a girl guide when I was growing up in Canada can't say enough about the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts program but you know these girls I even had to go back to the basics on teaching them how to cut fruit with a knife because they had been kept in such a bubble with their parents that they weren't even allowed to hold anything sharper than a butter knife and then you know then getting them to work as a team and trust me if if I can now say I was able to guide a group of young teenagers because I had these girls when they're daisies they were like five six years old all the way through to teenagers you know the fact that I was able to get them to stay focused on a task embrace new challenges and actually work together trust me you know you'll be well prepared to mentor anybody and one of the little lessons too that I was taught as a as a leader I actually use in oil and gas is you know if you want to get these young girls or anybody if you want to get somebody to just listen you need to keep their mouth busy and so with the young girls I would show up with a bowl of lollipops and then so then you know they weren't necessarily talking they're focusing what I have to say so now if you see me coming to a meeting or a conference and oh yeah and I'm known for bringing in Girl Scout cookies or food or something there's usually a method to my madness and it's not because I'm wanting to fill your belly again I'm wanting to ensure that you're actually listening to what I have to say I think you just doubled your expected attendance for all future appearances and by the way this is the time of year where at least in the United States that the Girl Scouts are selling their cookies it's going to a good cause but make sure you don't take all the thin mints because that's my favorite cookie and I'm gonna be storing up for the year so the freezers for Exactly and yes SP board meetings usually this time of year actually in in next month my board meetings in Buenos Aires and I can pretty much guarantee that I'm gonna be bringing Girl Scout cookies down with me that's fantastic what are some other important differences and opinions and perspectives that we need to be looking for when we are seeking mentors other than whether or not they can provide us with sugary treats well I also firmly believe that you just don't just have one mentor at a time you get several that are comprised of individuals who are in positions that interest you and have behaviors that you want to emulate so you create what I call it kind of a personal advisory board it's beneficial to have a mentor to that interacts in your work environment so you know you need at least an individual that sees you in dated activities to catch those coachable moments but then also to SP offers through their e-mentoring program a great tool to find other industry colleagues just to get a different perspective at a difference and you know I go into more details with the e-mentoring program in my column but I want to emphasize at least in this podcast that it's a program that allows a mentor and a mentee to communicate at their convenience and across time zones you know this is a short-term commitment it's a six month partnership where you communicate a couple times per month via the e-mentoring messaging system and you can do it email Skype if you're fortunate you maybe can work it you can do some face-to-face as a mentee you can only be connected to one mentor at a time whereas those that are serving as mentors can actually have up to three mentees at a time and when Jason you talked about you know at different time periods in your life seeking out different mentors again because this is such a valuable program that we have with an SP not only to serve our members for members to use this is something like when we're setting your goals you know always commit as to seek out through the e-mentoring a mentor every year and get all those different perspectives to again give you those life lessons at different points in your career so I really encourage everybody to check out the e-mentoring website it's just at spe.org backslash e-mentoring and there's already a lot of people in this program as of printing my column there was over 1,300 total members from up to 71 countries participating and I put more of a breakdown in the column but if we were to split it by discipline a majority of those in the e-mentoring program or in reservoir production on operations and drilling and then you can you'll see the split so for mentors we have almost 1,800 mentors right now and then as far as mentees it's actually a little bit less it's well let's see I'm at you're making me do math in my head as I'm looking at my numbers in my column but it's it's about 60 40 percent yeah and we're gonna include the link to SPE's e-mentoring website in the show notes of this podcast on that website there are a couple of testimonials as well so you can actually hear what some people have said how the e-mentoring program has impacted their career from both the mentoring and the mentee vantage points SPE is proud to offer a mentoring program for both mentors and mentees e-mentoring is a distance mentoring program that gives members a way to contribute to the E&P industry by sharing industry insights and practical career advice with young professionals or by helping university students with academic and career direction young professionals also have the unique opportunity to serve as mentors to students a six-month connection allows members and mentees to communicate electronically at their convenience learn more at spe.org slash e-mentoring George Lucas he's a very well-known movie director and he has a great quote that I also put into the JPT article and it's mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like and it's the only way we grow and I don't mention this in the column but I want to actually tout the value of 360 degree feedback now while we all dread having to do that and this is when it's anonymous feedback from around your peers as to how you're being perceived and again when I say we fear it because we don't want to hear that criticism that feedback but it really really one helps us to be aware of it and then to grow as a mentor there's always so much satisfaction to be gained in investing in someone's career development but also to I'm still challenging those even myself that we need to take the time to invest into ourselves and seek out being mentored also I actually want to quick give a shout out to one of my relatively new mentors that I have now as well is Greg Lavelle he's the CTO of Conoco Phillips and he has been fantastic in mentoring me in having not only an effective industry network but how to effectively leverage that and so along with Craig he's one of the ones that I'm going to be focusing on strengthening relationships with that's one of my goals for this year and I'm also going to be strengthening my relationships with those that I am mentoring I am currently mentoring young male and female engineers around the world but I really want to make sure that I'm still helping them develop and folks focusing on them while I am busy doing my SPE travels because again it's an investment that it's going to realize maximum gains for all for them as well as for me now and and I'm also very grateful for those individuals that provided the constructive criticism mind it I wasn't grateful when they were given the criticism at the time and really it's taken it's taken a while for me to be able to appreciate it and accept it you know I'm just really thankful to the support and being a member of SPE has enabled me to seek out the right mentors throughout my careers because they've given me so many opportunities from all different disciplines different parts of the globe different phases of the career and connect up with them thinking about and reflecting I would say that probably 70% of my most influential mentors came through SPE channels and not through work and so I want to encourage my fellow SPE members to reach out and become a mentor or mentee you know we've talked about the individual gains and investments but if we help one another to become better contributors and innovators collectively we not only elevate our society but the industry overall so take this time to be a mentor to seek out being mentored to recognize those that made a difference and to make a difference in others I also want to wrap up the way I started with thanking my most influential mentor was my mother and I'm a big girl now and I keep that criticism coming mom because I'm able I'm able to take it a lot easier so thank you and thanks to you Jason as well for this and that's uh let's just keep investing in one another sounds good to me and if you haven't already please go read

SPE President‚Äôs Podcast with Terry Palisch: ‚ÄùCreating Our Energy Future‚Äù - September 2023,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the October 2023 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast, creating our energy future with SPE President Terry Palish. And now your moderator, SPE Senior Manager of Communication and Energy Education, Paige McCowan. Welcome to the Society of Petroleum Engineers Podcast with the SPE 2024 President Terry Palish. I'm Paige McCowan, Senior Manager of Communication and Energy Education at SPE. Today, I'll be talking with Terry about his thoughts on how SPE and its members fit into the energy transition and what it means for our energy future. Hi, Terry. Hi, Paige. It's good to talk to you. You too. I think this is going to be an exciting episode. It's very timely. I think so. Yeah, exactly. So before we dig into the topic today, I know SPE has a board meeting this month at the Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in San Antonio. Can you tell us a little bit more about the goals for this meeting? Yeah, let me maybe just start by talking about kind of format. So the board meets four times a year officially. We, as you said, are meeting soon in San Antonio at the ATC. So we meet once a year at the ATC. We meet twice a year at the location chosen by the president. And then we meet once virtually in January. And the two that are chosen in the spring and summer are typically very strategic. They typically look, we look to support the region or the section, the local companies. As an example, this year in the spring, we're in Dahran, Saudi Arabia in March, and then Kuala Lumpur this summer. And those were the first times we visited the Middle East and Asia Pacific in several years. So it was important to get back to those regions and meet with local leaders. As far as the goals for the meetings, we typically have two full days of committee meetings. We have some minor committees, as well as our two primary committees, technical content and membership engagement. And the primary goal is to work with senior staff on, you know, to see how we're performing relative to our strategies, as well as, you know, setting strategy and understanding where we're headed. When we met in KL in July, our two primary committees that I mentioned, they spent at least half their time discussing the new strategic plan and developing action items to help make sure that we continue to meet our members and our constituencies' needs. I'll just give you one example. We'll be talking about it again in San Antonio, the technical content committee. One of their primary questions is, you know, how do we continue to evolve our event formats? How do we stay up and implement new technologies, technologies of the day, so that we can continue to meet our attendees and our exhibitors and our sponsors' expectations and provide value to them? So we actually have a work group in place to answer this. But, you know, just overall, it's a fairly intense three days of meetings, along with some meeting with local companies and local leaders. Yeah, that's great. I mean, I know those are pretty intense and you guys do a lot of work towards it. So you mentioned that the board tries to be strategic and support the local regions. Can you elaborate on that? Sure. It'll probably be easiest just to give you some examples. Last summer, we were in Amsterdam. When we were there, we met with Shell. We toured their Shell Energy Transition Center, got to see what they're doing. In ATC in Houston last fall, we met with ExxonMobil executives, discussed their activities and toured their spring campus and labs. In Dharan, we toured the Aramco Shaiba field in the empty quarter. It was a great visit. We visited their technology center. And then we also, in addition to that, try to engage with local leaders. In Kuala Lumpur in July, we hosted a panel discussion with the Asia-Pacific Advisory Council. We have several of those councils across the world. This particular council is very active in the region. It's led by Adif Sulfi-Keefli, the executive vice president of Petronas. He was joined in this panel by executives from ExxonMobil, Shell, S.O.B., Petropermina. And they just relayed to us just how important it is for operators in the region to bring energy to the local region and the area, particularly natural gas, but also just how important it is for them and what they're doing to decarbonize their operations. So it was a great discussion. I think it was great to meet the local leaders and support them. And I, of course, can't thank Petronas enough for their hospitality and hosting us. Yeah, that's great. I mean, I think it's really important for the S.P.E. board to be involved in the regions. And I think our members appreciate your involvement where they work and the companies that employ them. Yeah. So recently also, I read an article on J.P.T. website that you've led a delegation to Beijing for a week of meetings. I know that's an important region for our members. Can you tell us a little bit about the purpose? Absolutely. So just by way of background, S.P.E. first entered China in 1979. Today we have six sections, 14 student chapters, and a good presence there. And since we're in the region at Kuala Lumpur, I decided to take a delegation to China. We had a group made up of a couple of board members as well as senior staff. And really the primary purpose was to re-meet with leadership of the NLCs. We need to re-engage. After COVID, it was really the first time we've been back and really wanted to hear their concerns, what they're working on, their concerns for the future, and just how S.P.E. can help. It was a great week. We met with several high-level delegations, Cinepec, CNUC, RIPED. We met with Aramco Asia and toured their lab. And then, of course, the week culminated with a face-to-face meeting with Dr. Ho-Chin Jun, who's the president of CNPC. He was a gracious host. He not only took time out of his busy schedule to meet with us, but also was our host for arriving in China. But I will say this, in all cases, we heard how important it is for the NLCs to be bringing energy to China in all forms. But in particularly, they want to continue to grow their oil and natural gas reserves and production. They need to meet the needs of China's growing economy. They see the need for technologies. China's always been big in EOR, but they continue to see new technologies there. They are looking at developing their own conventional resources or continuing to look at offshore growth. But in addition to those energy supply concerns, they're also very big in looking into CCUS. They want to lower their carbon footprint. One of the reasons we are having a CCUS workshop in the next spring in China, and they were very pleased to hear that we were leading that. I will say that all the leaders that we met with are very appreciative of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. They see SP as the ideal mechanism for disseminating information, for helping them develop new technologies, providing a platform for innovative collaboration, both at the local level as well as across the globe. So just a great visit, and it was really good to meet the leaders. And I'm excited for where we're headed in China. Yeah, that does. That sounds very exciting. So I know it's a very important region again. So thank you for those updates. I know members are always curious about how the board works. So we'll be looking forward to your monthly updates in your podcast episodes. So let's get to our topic. So in September, in your September podcast episode, you mentioned your presidential theme, creating our energy future. What is our energy future in the context of today's energy transition environment? Yeah, so, you know, I recently attended the SBE's inaugural energy transition symposium in Houston. It was a two-day symposium. It included panel sessions, executive discussions, keynotes. It was technical papers, and it was a great event. It brought together a great mix of almost 200 engineers, scientists, managers, executives from all walks of life, both in our industry as well as outside. We had many non-members there, many members, many attendees that were new to an SP event. And they all came together to really discuss our industry's role in the energy transition. And there were several themes that came out. One overarching theme was that the world is going to need increasing amounts of energy. We have growing population. We have emerging, developing countries. And the other part of that is that there was general agreement that oil and gas is going to be needed to meet these demands. How much oil and gas is debatable, but tremendous needs for oil and gas in the future. And the other part of that theme, the other theme that came out is carbon capture and storage is going to be critical to reducing CO2 emissions. So we also heard that there's just really no transition without the engineers and scientists in our industry. And that was a key theme for us. I just want to say that again, we heard that there is no transition without the engineers and scientists in our industry. And why is that? Well, because we need to not only grow our oil and gas production, but also we are critical to reducing CO2 emissions through carbon capture and storage and other decarbonization of our operations. For those in our industry, I just want to say that our future is very bright based on what I heard there, whether it's to be to continuing finding innovative ways to recover more hydrocarbons, or to use our petroleum engineering skills to grow CCS and geothermal, or just to flat out reduce our carbon footprint of our operations like we're doing now. The key to our energy future will be technology and collaboration. That was the key theme that came out at the end of the symposium in Houston. That's great. Yeah, that's a great key message there. And I think a lot of our members, our younger members and our student members are concerned about that. So based on what you learned and what you know, how do petroleum engineers and our members create their energy future in this context? Well, as I said before, the world's going to need more oil and gas. And to be able to produce the additional oil and natural gas, we're going to need to continue advancing technologies we're working with today. Those technologies in all aspects of our discipline, whether it's drilling or completions, formation, evaluation, production, reservoir, they're all critical. And we know that without technology, we won't be able to meet those needs. We are also needed, petroleum engineers, our industry, for decarbonization efforts. I mentioned them a little bit before. You know, we are well suited to help solve, you know, making geothermal economic, drilling, completion, reservoir, all those are important. Of course, carbon capture and storage, critical, right in our wheelhouse. So petroleum engineers can participate in that. And then we just have, you know, methane emissions reduction, flaring reduction, you know, things like that. It's important to our future that we develop technologies that not only increase the oil and gas reserves, but also introduce our environmental footprint. I think about safety and how safety has become a part of our culture. So sustainability and the environment need to do that as well. And we're we are doing that as we speak, I think companies are embracing that. And petroleum engineers are embracing that. But the thing to keep in mind is that technology changes fast, and it's changing ever quicker as we go in the future. And our members, we must engage in the practice of lifelong learning. And if they do that, I think they can create their energy future in any context they desire within the energy spectrum. So you mentioned it just a second ago about engaging in lifelong learning. How else or how more can SPE help its members create their energy future? Yeah. Well, let me first say that SPE exists to serve its members and their companies. It's to help them advance their technical skills and their professional competencies in their jobs. Just like I've talked about the gym membership, this is to help your professional. No matter what the future holds, SPE will continue to meet the diverse regional needs of all of our members across the globe. Our members come from all aspects of the business, oil and gas development, sustainability and related energies. Our industry and our members are uniquely positioned to solve the three way challenge of providing affordable, secure and decarbonized energy to the world. We're going to need tremendous advancements in oil and gas recovery, as I mentioned before, in order to meet the energy demand. And we're also going to need expertise in decarbonizing our operations. To accomplish this need for lifelong learning, SPE members are going to need to continue to build their technical competence, whether they're reading papers or attending conferences or workshops or training. But they're also going to need to collaborate. As we mentioned earlier, collaboration is going to be key. There's obviously plenty of opportunities provided by SPE Connect or joining one of our 22 technical sections, whether it be petroleum engineering related, like hydraulic fracturing technical section, or just some of the newer ones like geothermal or CCS or hydrogen. But in the end, by exercising the benefits and offerings of SPE in these areas, you can create your energy future and SPE will be there to provide those. So what would you say if you could talk directly to our young members about this? What would be your advice or what would you tell them? Well, I visited many sections and student chapters and one thing I can say is the young members are all excited about our industry, just like the the seasoned members are as well. They all want to be part of a solution to providing affordable, secure decarbonized energy to the world. They all want to be able to do that. And so I think they all want to be doing something that's meaningful and I think they're excited about it. But we need to remember that it's going to take the best and the brightest minds to solve this. So those of you that are looking at our industry, our students, or new to our industry, you're the future and you're going to be bringing these new technologies. So I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of SPE to increase their technical knowledge and expertise, as well as to collaborate work with their peers. This is how you'll advance your career. This is how you'll allow all of us to create our energy future. I'd also like to just take a moment to encourage everyone to go out and get at least one SP member. How about it make that a goal? And by adding to our membership, it will improve our knowledge base, it'll improve our ability to collaborate, and ultimately it'll improve our professional competencies. SPE is going to continue to evolve to be a part of the sustainable energy future and ensure the careers for future generations. That's a great positive message and I think a lot of people will be happy to hear you say that. So Terry, what's on tap for next month's podcast episode? Yeah, I think we're going to go ahead and try to dive a little bit deeper into some of the new technology and collaboration that's needed for the future of oil and gas and really just kind of how your membership and how our membership helps improve the technical competencies. We'll dive a little bit deeper into how SPE is delivering the technical content, some of the things we're looking at in the future, as well as how do we provide the networking opportunities to our members to help what some call the energy trilemma. We'll talk a little bit about that. I kind of like to call it the energy opportunity. It's the energy opportunity for us and it's the opportunity for us to create our energy future. Thank you Terry. Thanks for giving us a glimpse into your thoughts on the energy transition and how our members fit into it. I know it's a big topic of conversation and it sounds like we'll be continuing on this topic in episodes to come. Thanks Paige, it's always good to catch up with you. You too. Terry will be doing monthly podcasts which you can find each episode with transcripts on the first of every month on SPE's JPT website and in the monthly digital edition of JPT."
"SPE President's Podcast with Terry Palisch: ""Creating Our Energy Future"" - The Importance of Supporting Academia and Students in Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities in the Industry - May 2024","Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the September 2023 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast, creating our energy future with incoming 2024 SPE President Terry Palish. And now your moderator, Director of SPE Magazine's Pam Bojji. Welcome to the Society of Petroleum Engineers podcast with our 2024 President Terry Palish. I'm Pam Bojji, Director of SPE Magazine's, and Terry joins me today to share his thoughts about being named president with the official passing of the baton from 2023 President Med Kamal at our annual technical conference and exhibition in San Antonio in October. Terry is the Vice President of Technology and Engineering at Carboceramics in Richardson, Texas. He began his career with ARCO, during which he served 10 years in Alaska and 4 years as a senior petroleum engineering advisor in Algeria. He joined Carbo in 2004 and in his current position leads a team of technologists developing and championing new products and services and advising clients on completion and fracture optimization. Terry has been an SPE member for more than 40 years, serving in various roles, including past chairman of the SPE Dallas section. He has been the past chair of the ATCE technical program and the former SPE Completions Technical Director. He is an SPE distinguished member and received the award for distinguished service as well as the SPE Mid-Continent Regional Completions Optimization and Technology Award and the Regional Service Award. In 2013, he was named one of the top 15 best engineers by the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association and in 2015, he was named the SPE Dallas Section Engineer of the Year. He has authored more than 50 SPE technical papers and holds several patents. He holds a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering from the University of Missouri Rolla, now the Missouri University of Science and Technology and was recently recognized as a distinguished alumnus. Welcome Terry. It's a pleasure to talk with you today. Well thank you Pam. It's fun to be with you. I'm excited to kick off this series that we've discussed doing and hopefully the members will find it useful. But again, I'm excited to be here and I'm excited to talk to you. So our members learn a bit about you and a little bit more about your background. Let's begin with key issues you'll emphasize as the 24 SPE president. You have selected creating our energy future as your theme. Can you tell us about it? Yeah, great question. So you know over the course of the last eight months or so, I've had the distinct privilege to meet with multiple sections and student chapters. I've seen anniversary celebrations. I've led opening sessions at 50th anniversary at SPIDC. I've hosted awards presentations. One of the things that is just really exciting to me is that our members and our students, they're excited about the petroleum engineering profession that they're in and they're excited about our industry. But at the same time, they also recognize that things change and that while oil and gas is going to be critical to the future, they also want to know kind of what is their place going to be, particularly in the younger members and where we're headed. So I chose creating our energy future. I thought about your and my and things like that, but really it's our. And it really kind of has a twofold meaning to me. First is you and I and the members, the membership. We want to create our energy future. We want to understand how we're going to thrive and how we're going to excel and how we participate. And we do that via our SP membership. Perhaps we can talk a little bit more about it, but I kind of liken it to a gym membership. It's been very impactful to my professional career. And I think that it's important for the members to treat their SP membership like a gym membership. There's many things to offer at the gym and you're working on your personal well-being and your health. And SP allows you to work on your professional development and professional well-being. So the first part of that creating our energy future is our future as members in the oil and gas industry. And how do we thrive? And what does SP help with that? How does SP help? But the second part of that is SP's future, our future as SP as a society. So, of course, the board continues to work on that. I'm excited. Mark Rubin set a wonderful foundation for us. And now we have Simon Seton coming on as our new CEO. And I'm excited for where we go next. How do we continue to grow our membership? How do we continue to meet our members' needs? And it's going to take not only our ideas, but it's going to take the members' ideas and the input from everybody. Because again, we are a member organization and a member society. And we are here as SP to meet the needs of the members. And so kind of just to recap, creating our energy future is our being. How do we thrive in the industry, in our industry, in our career? But then also, how does SP move ahead? Well, and along the lines of looking toward the energy future, another component of that is the SPE board of directors approved its strategic plan just this past January. That plan also looks ahead and plans SPE's role in approaching the future and the industry. Could you share a bit about the process behind developing that plan and some of the key takeaways? Sure. So, you know, for those that aren't aware, every three to five years, the board sits down, the board and senior staff sit down and develop a strategic plan and relook. And this particular plan, you know, we got started on it in roughly Q3, Q4, 22 last year. And towards the end of the year and beginning of 2023, we rolled it out. And really, the process, it starts with an assessment of the current environment and not just the current environment of what we're in, but also what is the current environment that their members find themselves in. So quite a bit of data gathering and information gathering is done with the membership. And, you know, this time around, what we found is that the members are concerned about five things. I mean, they're concerned about, you know, how are we as technologists going to continue to produce more and more oil and gas is going to be needed? And, you know, secondly, how are we going to implement new technologies? What are going to be the new technologies that help us do that? Third being what is our place in the energy transition? And then last two are, you know, just again, how do we continue to attract students and others to our profession? And then, of course, the ongoing image with the public. Nothing was surprising, probably. And maybe some of it's not even new. But it's always good to ground yourself and kind of what is the current environment. And then from there, we developed and looked at the mission. Does the mission still meet those the needs of the members? Does the vision or core values still in place? So we did actually make a reasonably a reasonable modification to our mission this year. Last time we went through this process, we added a few words, but this year we kind of reorganize it. But it's still generally the same. It's still to provide technical information, disseminate technical information and help our members excel in their profession. And then finally, the meat of it, it then becomes the strategy, the strategic plan becomes identifying what are the goals and the following objectives for implementing. What do we see as our strategic goals? We know we did identify our key stakeholders and the goals have to be associated with these key stakeholders, those key stakeholders being our members first and foremost, but also our members companies, our sponsors and advertisers, our educators, our academia and then lastly, our external stakeholders. So as we put together our goals, we have those stakeholders in mind. And I'm not going to go through all the goals, but each of the goals has objectives that were identified as critical. They need to be done now. Immediate needs to be done soon and then intermediate that would be done later. We are actually in the middle of working through the implementation of the action items as we speak. And we will continue to be working on it. And again, it's a five year, four to five year plan. So it'll continue to evolve over time. But that's that's kind of how it works in the end, though. Again, it's it's it's how do we continue? It's the second part of our creating our energy future I was talking about. And that's the S.P.E. side of it. And I'd also like to just add here that the strategic plan is available on the S.P.E. website for anyone who would like to read more about it or see more details about some of the highlights you just provided. Terry, I'd like to ask you to what would you say to a student who would ask you, why should I go into the oil and gas industry or why should I go into the energy industry? You yourself have weathered many up and down cycles over your years in the industry. What what would you have to offer to a student's question about that? Great question. Well, first, I would say that, you know, every every year our world sets new records for energy usage. We continue to grow the amount of energy that we need. And that's going to continue to grow. We have continuing pressure on more and more energy as the population increases, as the underdeveloped world or say the developing countries continue to grow, you know, as they strive to to meet the energy needs of their their population, energy needs are going to continue to grow. And currently, 80 percent of the energy is provided from fossil fuels. That number has been pretty constant over the last decades, and it's really not going to change any time soon. And really, in fact, if you look at a lot of projections, you'll see that the incremental energy that's needed is going to be supplied by renewables and non oil and gas, non fossil fuels, but they'll still be the base load need. So my point is oil and gas is going to be critical for the future. That said, we have to be able to not only provide affordable and reliable energy, but also ever decarbonized. And so there's the opportunity for our industry. And so, you know, as I as I talk to young students or students and young members, I try to explain to them that, you know, you're the future, you know, entering those entering our workforce, they need to understand, you know, how are they going to stay abreast of the changing technologies, whether it's in oil and gas extraction or decarbonization, it's important to to to to do that. And to and we and I hope that what they'll see is that, you know, their S.P. membership and the things that offers the S.P. offers can help them meet those needs. They may not need to be experts in everything, but they are it allows them to understand enough about topics that are important to our day that they can know when to deploy some of these other technologies. So I think that's the advice I give. I mean, the last thing I'll say is that, you know, I I try to encourage everybody to do four things. Learn, participate, volunteer and lead. Learn as much as you can, right, whether it's papers or attending conferences or webinars, participate in your local section, volunteer. And then if you do those things, you'll find yourself leading. And it kind of then leads to what kind of I got out of S.P.E. as well. Thank you for that. What other thoughts would you like to share? Perhaps some points that we haven't touched on that are particularly important to you or that you would like to emphasize to the membership, our students and our younger members, too. Let me start by saying kind of going back to the gym membership analogy. We all get different things out of S.P.E. I mean, if we go back to my career and what I've gotten out of S.P.E., I mean, it's been critical not only for the technical side of things and learning and improving my technical expertise, but but it's also been important to my soft skills. So, I mean, writing papers, presenting papers, being a leader, a volunteer and a leader. I mean, I like to tell younger members, you know, we all would like to be a CEO someday. We're not all going to be. And so, you know, for me, S.P.E. has provided professional development. You know, I was I was leading the Dallas section long before I was a vice president at a Carbo. And I think that those experiences have helped me. So so I think that going back to the gym membership, you know, we joined gyms, we joined health clubs probably early in our lives, probably do them for fun. Later in our lives, we do it because the doctor told us we had to. And so but regardless, we joined up. We do that for for multiple reasons. I might go to ride the spin class. Someone else might go to swim. Someone else might go to the yoga class. But the bottom line is we're doing that for physical well-being. And I think that we need to I tend to think treating your S.P.E. membership is the same way. And that's what I want to try to impress upon people over the next, you know, months as we do these podcasts is, you know, as you progress in your professional career, there are things and offerings that S.P.E. have and probably some that we haven't even thought of yet that will help you with your career. So so for me, for example, early in my career, I just, you know, I kind of went to a few section meetings here and there. I went to topical conversations that I thought were important to me. And then as I began to grow, I started attending and writing papers and attending more conferences. And I started realizing how much I helped my technically, but also it helped me learn how to present. It made it learn made me learn how to write technical writing. And then, of course, I also recognize when I came to Carbo that it's important for us to to meet clients. And go to exhibitions and advertising. And so then it became something a little bit different to me then. And then as I as I worked through that and I became a part of the Dallas section, you know, quite frankly, somebody came to me and said, would you be interested in serving on this committee? And and of course, I said yes, because it's hard to say no in person. And before, you know, I was the section chair and then that led to other things. So, I mean, I could go on and on on this. But the bottom line is, you know, these are the kinds of things that I think that help you personally. And and that's what I hope that we can learn more about in the future on these podcasts is is just talking about some of the things that the things that we may not realize that SP offers and how you can specifically help your career. Maybe as a corollary, how it helped my career. Well, thank you, Terry, for giving us a glimpse of your own career, your experience and also your experience over the years with SP. I'd like to mention now that Terry will be doing monthly podcasts, which you can find with transcripts on SP's Journal of Petroleum Technology website and in the monthly digital edition of JPT available on the first of each month. In October's podcast, Terry, I believe you will share your thoughts about the evolution of the energy transition and what does the future of petroleum engineering look like and how does SP fit in? Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. And, you know, I just want to again, thank everybody, the members, the volunteers. I can't tell you how excited I am when I meet people out in the industry and in our society. And and I hope that you will continue to to volunteer and that together we can continue to create our your and our energy future. Thank you. We hope you have enjoyed this edition of the S.P.E. President's podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts. On the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
SPE President‚Äôs Podcast with Terry Palisch: ‚ÄùCreating Our Energy Future‚Äù - October 2023,"I'm Jason Notouris joined by Nils today and you just heard from a few of the committee members, speakers and participants from SPE's virtual international oil field scale conference and exhibition wrapping up today. It's been a pretty exciting event so we're going to discuss some of the big takeaways from that but also a lot to bring you, right Nils? Absolutely, yeah coming up in the show shortly we'll be hearing from Mark Rubin the CEO of SPE and SPE's new ventures into virtual events. Also we have Phil Chandler the event director for SPE for the oil field scale conference so he can give us his view about how well the conference has been so far and also special guests in the program we have Dr. Kari Ramstar from Equinor and Professor Eric Makai from Heriot-Watts both have been deeply involved in the conference. And one of the bigger roles that we've seen throughout all this is just SPE adapting to its first virtual event. Nils you were able to participate, take a few walkthroughs through this. What was your one big takeaway of what occurred this week? I think just the the high caliber of the event. I mean it's just been really really good content, really engaged, really high engagement with the audience throughout the three days you know very very steady fantastic discussions at the end of presentations, very high quality presentations so all around a really really enjoyable experience for both presenters and participants so yeah very high caliber very impressed. All right time to bring in our first guest as well CEO of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Mark Rubin joining us now live. Mark welcome. Thank you very much. So Nils did you have a question or you want me to just start? I was just going to ask you Mark first of all welcome to the show big step for SPE you know first international virtual events so tell us a bit more about SPE's progress into the virtual space. Sure thank you very much. So as as mentioned I'm Mark Rubin I'm the CEO of SPE and my role in SPE is to manage the staff organization we have about 270 staff in seven offices around the world and a lot of those staff are involved in organizing events. In the past it's you know been really all in-person events and now our new venture into virtual events and I'm really very happy to see us complete the first virtual SPE technical conference the International Oil Field Scale Conference and this is the first of what I believe is going to be a long-term program of many virtual events. It's kind of the beginning of a new area we were kind of dragged into this because of the pandemic as far as doing more of these than we anticipated but these events support the mission of SPE our mission is to support our members by sharing technology and this is the means that we have given the pandemic and so we're going to take advantage of it. You know one of the things I liked about the format is that it makes it very easy for people to participate. We were able to get more registrants for this event than if we had had the event in person because people don't have to travel and people can participate from all over the world fairly easily because even if you can't be there for the live presentation you can watch the on-demand presentation and so I've been following this the last three days and I thought everything went really well and I'm really proud of the work that everybody did to to make this happen and so this is the first we've got more coming in July and then more in August and September and on after that. We've got three virtual events coming up in July one is ERTEC the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference and that's one that we do in partnership with AAPG and SEG and then also in late July we've got LACPEC the Latin American Petroleum Engineering Conference and the International HSE Conference coming up and so we're making good progress on organizing those and you know the thing about it is someday the in-person conferences and workshops are going to come back but one thing that's clear to me is that these virtual events are going to be a permanent part of SBE's program going forward. It allows us to do a few things it allows us to to meet a niche for people who really don't have the time or the funds to travel all over the world to attend an event. It also is going to allow us to organize some of our events in a hybrid form with an in-person and a virtual component. So I really do want to thank the program committee for pivoting with us and converting this event to a virtual event. I also want to thank all the staff who worked hard in a relatively short time frame to organize the event very successfully and I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to to be in this program and talk about it and as was I think Jason mentioned earlier if you have feedback give us your feedback you can give us feedback through the live chat or you can email us or however you want to contact us but we really do welcome your feedback and thank you all the participants and for everybody who's listening today. Oh thank you Mike that's a really great summary of of this big step for for SPE and how SPE is beginning to embrace this new digital virtual reality. Now I'm going to introduce our next guest onto the show Dr Kari Ramstein. She is Equinor and she was the keynote speaker on the first day of the conference. Welcome Kari welcome back to the show good to see you. Firstly a big thank you to Equinor for sponsoring the event a true testament for encouraging you know knowledge sharing and innovation within oil and gas so thank you very much. I think a very successful conference for such a niche topic such as oil field scale but yet very important in terms of flow assurance oil and gas production well integrity. What's your take been on this three these last three days? I think it was a very good idea from SPE to arrange this conference in a virtual version because the papers had already been written and this conference runs every second year and I think everyone was very eager to meet up and to discuss and to to engage in in technical discussions and also seeing what the progress of different projects and research projects had been going so I think it was very good that you managed to do this and we saw through the technical presentations and the discussions that there were both case histories there were new lab techniques for monitoring and for testing chemicals there were also prediction studies going on and a great variety of content in the conference and great discussions and since many of the delegates know each other in person it's been a quite informal and nice atmosphere in the virtual version of the conference as well so thank you SPE. Thank you yeah thank you very much Kari that's a great take thank you so just for the benefit of the audience can you just give us a short summary of your keynote what were you presenting on on day one? I was presenting a work that has been going on for several years actually where we have collected field experiences on calcium carbonate scaling and we have been trying to correlate this with the thermodynamic calculations to see what will the risk of scaling be in a particular case and what measures should we take what scale management strategy should be chosen so what we've seen is that there is an important temperature dependence on the scale risk and that goes for the field development drilling on new wells and how to plan for scale management so that was the main content of my keynote. Thank you thank you Kari so you mentioned just a moment ago you know that you've there was a lot of new information being presented at the conference for you given the the material that you presented on Equinor strategy what what new things will you take back to Equinor now and apply it to your own research and operational development? Well we are going into new areas we are we have been mostly in the Norwegian continental shelf but we are also going into internationally so some of these more exotic scales and how to manage that and carbonate reservoirs and so on that's important for us to learn about and also new lab techniques for monitoring produced water compositions and also modeling scale squeeze treatments placement and so on so there there's a lot of takeaways that we will discuss internally after the conference. That's good to hear so thank you I mean that's obviously sort of a reassurance that you know these kind of events you know they have a return on investment as you were in terms of what you give you also can take back a lot so absolutely yeah you mentioned also about the sort of this new virtual world that was the conference can you say a little bit about your experience in terms of the discussion that was facilitated and between the presenters and the audience during the conference? Yes I think the the most useful discussions were straight after the presentation where we had the chat going and we had direct questions and answers to and from the presenter and yeah almost between the delegates as well in the in the networking lounge it was a bit more difficult to connect one to one person so that could be something to look into more functionality on that and then there were the exhibition booths which worked well and we can also see the statistics afterwards how many people actually visited the booths and what were their main interests while they were at the booth so the platform one gets more and more familiar to the platform over the days so I think I I learned a lot about how to manage or how to navigate between the different platforms as well but it it was really a nice and impressive setup. Well thank you so you do it again then? Yes definitely. Okay it's good to hear so we we asked the audience a trivia question at the beginning so how to remove oilfield scale what are what are your opinions on that? My opinion? Yeah well it depends on the type of scale if you have carbonate scale or sulfide scale that may be dissolved by acid and carbonate scaling is quite easy to dissolve in acid and to remove sulfide scale is a bit more hazardous because that during that operation you release H2S which is a very poisonous gas on the other hand if you have sulfate scaling which is hard and low radioactive as well and very low soluble in chemicals then you have to actually mechanically remove it or by by pulse waving also you can brittle the scale and then remove it but that's very difficult and very costly so sulfate scaling we try to prevent and not having to remove. Yeah yeah absolutely it's a big cost otherwise as you say and a big risk also to the well integrity itself. Okay shouldn't we perhaps do we have our second guest in this? I think I do see Eric let's bring him in. So Eric you know oilfield scale traditionally a very niche conference but an important meeting place between industry and academia from your perspective Harriet Watt how's this conference been? Has it been as successful more successful? Yeah it's been a very interesting week for us so we had a training course on Monday and Tuesday and we had a good very good attendance at that at that training course we had over 25 people attending it and we were a bit a little bit apprehensive going into it and we changed our format a little bit so we just online it's a bit different and so you have to go for kind of 40 minutes 45 minutes and then take a break in the classroom when you're adding energy by your physical presence you can perhaps then you're getting the feedback from direct feedback from the audience you can see what whether they're falling asleep or not you can probably go for it a bit longer but actually the course the the q and a's at the end of each hour or so went very well. For the conference itself I've kind of noted down some positives and some some negatives the negatives I guess were because this is all new to us and as Carrie kind of indicated even over the space of three days as attendees we've adjusted and got used to it and realized what works well what doesn't doesn't work so well so just becoming familiar with it and you know small technical glitches you've got to use this browser and not that browser and all that kind of stuff we'll all get used to over time. I kind of missed a little bit the live questions I'll come back to that in a second so the sort of the q and a tended to be read over from from chat rather than people speaking speaking live and I kind of missed that a little bit and Carrie also mentioned the networking so the the lounge is something that we need to work on to make make more value of that I think part of it is because at the end of the presentations we go off and make ourselves a coffee or something like that and on site we'd be having that coffee with someone else but you know so we're going into sharing a coffee break whereas when you're sitting in your house at home or in your office whatever then you're having that coffee on your own. The positives as a huge positive which is how quickly everyone adapted to this situation I found that quite remarkable both the audience but especially the SP so to be able to get something like this up and running and online okay so some technical glitches but actually those were those were overcome pretty quickly and experience I think for everyone was good so the the speed of adapting I thought was fantastic and the quality of the presentation that's a really interesting one so the presentations were pre-recorded and run and then the authors were present for a live q and a session afterwards that's quite interesting because I would actually say the quality of the presentations were better than live because if you're giving a presentation if you then review that presentation yourself as a video of it and you review it you realize there are little things that you want to change before you have the final version which if you're doing live you might you might you're not so self-aware and so I would say that these presentations make really well done actually I think they work better than than than than when we're there live in person and and they're a tremendous resource so I've got an interesting question buzzing around at the back of my head as to I suppose the copyright with these presentations lives with the authors these are fantastic resource maybe the SP should be thinking about what to do with these recorded presentations wouldn't it be fantastic if we could have gone to one petro and download a paper and download a 15 or 20 minute presentation that goes alongside that paper so that's just a just a little thought there and then I actually thought that so the bit about the q and a that worked for me particularly well was that as people were thinking listening to the presentation if a question cropped up in their mind they would just write it down in the chat section so they didn't have to remember it to the end and there wasn't this kind of okay who's going to ask the question next the question came to your mind down it down it down it goes and so the session chairs would have a list of questions by the end and in fact because the authors were listening to their own presentations they were also able to look at the questions as they were coming in and so prepare their answers and so the answers were quite good quality and succinct and so on so I thought that aspect worked very well oh thank you eric that was you know fabulous feedback and yeah absolutely share many of those sentiments and comments noted on the presentations in one petro I think spe can come back to that I don't want to make a promise right here but certainly a very very well noted so for you know a lot of really good information presented at the conference are you going to take back to harry what some sort of new information some sort of aha moments to say yeah you know we can do put this into our joint industry project we're going to sort of make some changes yeah so there's a lot of good stuff and we're listening very carefully when people that carry stand up and make their presentations about about what's happening in the field so that's those are always invaluable for us and because the research has to be tuned towards what's happening in the in the in the field and so those those types of presentations are really important for us and there are other ones so something I particularly noticed this time around was in terms of scale deposition got a lot of good work being done on that so thermodynamics is is fairly well established we've got fairly good handle on how to make scale predictions and so on but knowing how much will deposit how fast it deposits is is a bigger challenge and and so there are a number of presentations ones from rice and other universities bringing in the importance of the hydrodynamics of how the flow how the fluids are interacting with the surface how they're coming into contact with the surface and so on and those are those are were very useful lots on optimizing of scale never to squeeze treatments which was some really good presentations I like the one that was on on field application of thermal fluorescence as an analysis we want to investigate further at the university as well it's nice to see that that presentation showing it actually being used in the field and the quality of the results from that that was encouraging yeah I like that presentation too we bring in that tracer type technology so on that note to carry on yourself looking ahead so you know 2022 maybe even 2021 you know a repeat of oval scale conference a bigger more international audience possible through a virtual space like this you know given what you've experienced the last three days what would you look forward to for the next event uh curry who first well I think it's important to meet in person also not just to go uh online so to speak and this conference as I said appears every second year and that is also to get the the number of papers that are needed for the conference to be a full program that gives new stuff and not one conference being too close to the next conference so that's something that we have been discussing and maybe have a workshop every second year in between but of course to be virtually is also a good good alternative and when when we do not have to travel it's more easy to attend also so maybe one can alternate between the two two scenarios yeah that's a very thoughtful comment actually yeah maybe having some sort of hybrid or alternating or even virtual workshops in between eric your thoughts what do you think looking ahead yes carry me a comment earlier that there was quite a relaxed and formal kind of chatty conversation going on between people that happened because the communities as you said in each community and we know each other and so we know each other from these physical meetings and so that made the virtual meeting uh much flow much better uh I think and then people who are new perhaps can can then feel more relaxed when they're when they're when they're joining in so I'm completely with carry on the concept of keeping the the main the larger conference to every second year and ensuring that you've got higher quality of papers by by by by doing that um but then having a workshop and I would very much uh favor having an in-person workshop where you can just sit around and chat and you know go out and have your coffee together with other people and have informal chats on the side and that will that will build up the the the the network uh and so that when we have these virtual meetings people already know each other and and can quickly you know relate to each other and can quickly move into into the technical discussions and so on a very interesting perspective so much for spe to to to digest so thank you and um you know just on behalf of the spe and the spe membership thank you to both of you for you know being part of the organizer committee and helping develop such a really interesting and engaging conference I'm going to pass back to to Jason for some final comments over here yeah thank you so much Nils we'll actually have a couple members of spe's executive team coming on to I guess give their reaction to the event as well maybe to the reaction of what both Kari and Eric were saying thank you to both of them so much for coming on to spe live and thank you to the event sponsors and exhibitors as well because that really helped the virtual event go forward as well as the spe foundation who not only supports spe live but also supports spe's virtual events because this is an avenue that spe is exploring and will be part of spe's future so whether or not you are able to attend oilfield scale there may be a event coming up that you have interest in that may be virtual that spe is putting on all right let's go ahead and bring in a few members of the spe staff now as well we have mark Rubin our ceo and phil chandler director of events in europe and caspian region welcome gentlemen thank you I was gonna say can you just provide us the initial reaction from this event okay um look I'm really very happy with the way the event turned out it you know the platform was relatively easy to use um I thought the the present I didn't watch every presentation but I watched several and I thought they were excellent the technology works for this I'm absolutely delighted with how the um the scale conference went over the last three days delighted and somewhat relieved because this is brand new for spe you know we haven't done an event like this before you know with a integrated training course content networking exhibition it's been a a huge success but spe is one of these organizations that it doesn't um it's a collaborative approach between um the society and its members um and although I have an extremely good events team in london um who have worked very hard to pull this together we wouldn't be able to do this without the volunteers and the people who committed on the committee and I'd like to say thank you very much indeed obviously to miles jordan who's the chair of the committee um to the whole committee themselves people like eric who not only sat on the committee but um also was doing training uh and then it's all about the content so speakers like cari um who give up their time as well yeah it's just not a little bit of time it's three days and this is a differentiation between what we do and what other virtual events do in the marketplace so the devaluation of content by all the three elements on the internet at the moment doesn't work for us so um and it doesn't actually apply to us people are are very happy to attend quality content over a number of days and our success is shown by the fact that you know our attendance on the events has grown by 100 we had 28 different countries actually dialing in and partaking within the conference's delegates every single continent in the world including australia at the beginning of the of of the day when we started at 12 o'clock and we were able to actually enable these and bring these people together for not just one hour or two hours at a stretch but five maybe six hours a day and we didn't lose the engagement at all you know i think the the participants cari and um uh and eric have got some very good learnings that we need to take away and adapt for moving forward um the engagements on the chat rooms with regards to the questions the q and a's were fantastic um the engagement in the training um was also very good as well and engagement in the networking room on day one was also very high um but yeah we could always do better um so um onwards and upwards to the to the next event but again thank you for the industry who actually do volunteer and provide the content um provide also the support during the um during the event um and we treat them as part of the team they are um actually um priceless to the success of spe phil you've actually mentioned all the different nations that were involved there let's just remove covid from the equation and just consider the virtual event platform as it is can you describe how this is a way that people who may never have been able to travel to where an in-person event would be are able to participate share learnings this this takes the technology and what other people have put into practice in case studies into regions that otherwise may not have had access to this previously no absolutely so it breaks down the barriers of cost i think more than anything because you know everybody will understand that throughout the um throughout the global throughout the globe there are areas that are obviously um enabled more with regards to uh access to money um so when you look at actually the um uh the breakdown of the countries actually participating we had people from peru um brazil so the actual cost of them to come all the way to abidine to enjoy and and engage with the professionals of uh you know their own peer group um is probably just not on uh on for that sort of thing so this breaks down the barriers of that also it adds a a greater um part to the enjoyment for everyone as well there are new people coming in with new ideas different ways of doing things they can bring their own learnings and personal um experience as well um and this actually um is a great sort of warm heart feeling for us because this is our mission our mission is actually to disseminate um knowledge and creative elements and technology across the whole world so it breaks down every single barrier um i get the in-person thing um sometimes you just cannot do that but we begin the relationship between new people and they can then carry this on after the event and they will meet up one day somewhere all right and continue that relationship face to face oh thanks also yeah lots of positive remarks in the audience chat particularly carolina little sorry um judyanna less are saying how good the content was and how important is or the additional achievement of reaching a new audience through the virtual platforms so um phil a short question to you um mark mentioned earlier some of the upcoming big virtual events what other virtual events do you have in your schedule uh looking ahead um i've got another four um four uh between now and christmas um and they they are very they are various so the um i'll start with one in london so the london upstream and finance conference will be virtual that's a one day high level investment orientated um event where really we we put together four panels over one day to discuss the various issues about investment in the oil and gas industry so that's happening um later on i think in november then we have the slightly delayed um subsurface conference uh in bergen that was happened uh was meant to happen in may and that now will happen um uh later on in uh in probably the fourth the fourth queue we had re um uh re uh moved it to a september time frame as well hoping that obviously covet would have um sorted itself out by then but unfortunately um we can't run it uh in person this year so we'll convert to that for virtual one we have a small workshop as well which will go virtual um in november and then we have the caspian technical annual conference in um uh sultan and that's going to be quite a big uh a big event to take virtual because that is a triple stream two day seven panel bilingual conference um so that will be a challenge um which we're looking forward to um everything we can do the only thing now that we need to uh perhaps practice between now and then is a simultaneous translation and how we um we cope with dual language challenge well neto well phil mark thank you both so much for joining us and providing the transparency and and and sharing with the audience what all is going on mark i'd like to go over to you now and just any any final thoughts or added comments that you would like to give us sure um you know sb exists solely for the benefit of our members uh and to help them in sharing technology um we've unfortunately not been able to have the the in-person events lately and but virtual creates a great opportunity to fulfill our mission and do what our members need us to do um i am personally looking forward to the time when we'll be able to have in-person events again but but even when that happens um it's pretty clear that these virtual events are going to be a permanent important part of our portfolio of helping our members so with that i do i do want to express again my thanks to uh the members on the program and other committees that helped put this together um without the members getting engaged and developing the content none of these events would happen so so thank you to to them very much yeah i almost feel like i could start a an oscar speech with the list of thank yous that need to go out um thank you both again phil and mark for joining us earlier for kari and eric for everyone's involvement with this event for supporting spe live i've had a blast this week nils absolutely it's been a fantastic week a big thank you to all i guess have been on this week kari eric miles uh amy everybody thank you to my dogs for being quiet during this program great week and we'll be back next week with even more content so all right until then i'm looking forward to it thank you guys thank you everybody thank you audience bye for now great weekend take care"
"SPE President's Podcast with Terry Palisch: ""Creating Our Energy Future"" - Enhancing Member Value - July 2024","Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the SPE Live Technical Director Series, Data Science and Production and Operations, Opportunities, Gaps and Future Outlook. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on October 28th, 2024. Welcome to this SPE Live Director Series, Data Science and Production and Operations, Opportunities, Gaps and Future Outlook. My name is Birol Dindoruk and I am the American Association of Drilling Engineers and I'm a Professor of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Houston. I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last about 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Our guest is Hamad El-Mari, is the current SPE Production and Operations and Projects Facilities and Construction Technical Director. He has been active as a SPE member for nearly 20 years. He began as an apprentice at Chevron in 1990 and joined Saudi Aramco the following year. He's presently working as producing department manager at Saudi Aramco for over 30 years of service in the oil and gas industry with diverse experience in production, reservoir management, drilling and facilities. Through which he has established a global network with IOCs, NOCs and major and global service companies. Shushma Ban is the chair of the ESP International Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Section and currently a board director at ICONS Science. Previously, Shushma was the chief data officer of subsurface and wells at Shell, where she created business, co-owned data strategies and accountability for global data accelerators, standards and subsurface digital value funnel. Shushma was the recipient of 2020 ESP International and 2019 ESP Gulf Coast Section awards for management and information for distinguished contributions to the petroleum industry. Hamad and Shushma, welcome to this ESP World Live. Thank you, Vidal. Good to be with you. Yeah, just to make a correction, I am the technical director for data science and Pushpaish is the chair for technical section. Thank you, Shushma. So it's great to be able to chat with you and go through this ESP Live session. And we have, it's not enough time, feels never enough actually for these activities, especially talking to two directors over here and experts. I'm going to start right away with a general question. Probably I'll ask Hamad first to start and follow with Shushma on this one. This area is very popular and we have a lot of questions at our audience as well as the technical people. Applications of data science, AI or machine learning in oil and gas development have received growing attention. AI and ML based techniques have been applied successfully in solving a wide range of problems, such as understanding reservoir, improved production and operations, and extracting information insights from data and solving complex problems. But of course, many of them to reduce the risk as well as increase the revenues and of course safety is being the key. The first one related to this is, could you please share us technical discipline activities and efforts related to data science applications, opportunities and adoption, including collaboration? Any recent trends and activities that you observe personally as well as within your discipline? Hamad. Okay, thank you, Birol. Thank you also to Shushma and glad to be with you both. Now, going back to the technical domain that we're attending today is the production and facilities and operations. And I will take you to throughout the areas, some of the domains that we're attending. And I will before that, I want to just give a glimpse of how significant now with AI in the oil and gas business. Now, every one of us know that there is a major impact on oil and gas as a result of adopting the application of the AI. And why is that? Because simply it's enhancing efficiencies, it's saving costs, it's improving the quality and sustainability, it optimizes production and makes work a place safer. If you look to the market size today of the AI in the oil and gas in 2020-2023, the closure of 2023, it reached to 5.9 billion. And the expectation that it will land in 2024 at about 6.7 billion. Now, the compounded annual growth rate of the AI in the oil and gas, it's about 14.2% annually. And throughout the investment plan, it's projected that it will reach about 25.2 billion by 2034. Now, most of this, it goes without saying, coming from North America with a contribution of about 39.12% of total revenue share. Now, I want to go back and just give some details about the applications and where do we use in our domains today the AI and how it's making an impact on every disciplines of our work. Now, I want to start with the exoperations. The AI today, it helps to a great deal the efficiency of the 3D seismic interpretation and processing and leveraging the machine learning. Now, if when we extend that to the deep learning where it can identify the, it can recognize the better relationships in the data sets, it helps to identify some of the geological features like fault lines, like the fractures, which helps and improve the reservoir characterizations. Now, I want to take it one step to the reservoir modeling based on the improvement that we will see as a result of the improvement in the geomodel or the static data that we have. The adopting the machine learning and the IoTs, the Internet of Things, and giving the ability to transmit the data real time will help to improve the real time acquisition and update of the production data in the reservoir modeling, which will help now update the model on real time and in a faster way whenever you want. Now, another area that the AI helps related to the reservoir modeling is the history match by adopting the Gaussian processes, which help reduce the uncertainties and increase the confidence level in the modeling. This is related to exorbitant and reservoir, not only about the production and operations. I will start with the flow assurance, for example. In the flow assurance, we have now with the machine learning helping us to predict some of the flow assurance phenomena that could happen in our pipeline, starting from modeling with a better and higher confidence, the flow realities and to predict some of the phenomena like hydrates in the gas. And if we have the real time data, then it can help you right away spot any hazards that could sometimes reach to obstructing the flow or in extreme cases rupture the lines. For the flow assurance, now we're shifting from physical flow meters to virtual flow meters, leveraging the big data that we used to receive from the physical flow meters. And this is a huge shift where now it will save the time, it will save the cost of the capital expense that usually companies, they spent in the development of their fields. Now, another use of the AI is the drone to detect methane emission or the subsurface robotics or subsurface vehicles where it can do inspection to the subsidy pipeline. And now even they're complementing some of the companies, they're complementing that with an autonomous boat and that they can drop some of these vehicles sub-seas in order to do the inspections. So it's simply, it's a full of applications that today it's transforming the whole industry from traditional to a very reliable, very resilient. Now, it's making cost effective and very efficient utilization of all the technologies that we have today. Thank you. Thank you very much. I see you raised a lot of great points over here from history match to especially converting this thing into timely response to production and updating models. So it looks like also it can gain or we can get a lot of efficiencies through it. So I'm going to go on this one to ask and repeat this question in a little different way so that it will be fused with these points as well to Sushma. So can you tell us, share with us your technical disciplines, disciplines activities, especially in the context of like WRFM like well reservoir facilities management, and also what would be the main efficiencies that can be gained through this one because your discipline is in a way is the connective tissue for many disciplines as well. Thanks, Pirol and Hammad. Great points. So I would say, you know, early from early days since I joined Shell, which was within 30 years ago, we were relying on data sciences with Scala systems, accessing all kinds of data and needless to say, with the event of AI ML, it's become a very key lever that can transform and revolutionize how oil and gas is working. Specifically from well reservoir facility management or how do we enhance production? I think one of the key things is how can we enhance, you know, the or augment the human decision making is kind of their data sciences and AI plays a role. And when we look at how these decisions are made, they are all multidisciplinary data related, you know, there are several systems involved. There are a myriad applications involved, but getting easy quick access to data quality and making sure that your geologists, geophysicists, reservoir engineers, production technologists, you know, all the key people who are involved to make interventions to make sure that we are doing the right thing. In the field, it definitely relies on how we get data and systems are aligned. And again, as, as we heard from Hammad, we are also looking at doing all these efforts with, you know, what is our environmental footprint? What is our sustainability, safety, security, you know, the carbon footprint is everywhere. So again, how do we measure? How do we enhance all this relies very heavily on making sure that the volumes of data we have, either whether from seismic or, you know, your area, but all the pressure volume temperature where you were leading it, you know, all those key things are quickly available through the right application automation. And with the event of AI, we are definitely seeing that it is reducing the time and effort. It is making use of already existing decisions and knowledge that might be there and really enhancing what humanly is not possible, whether you're looking at fault lines, as Hammad said, or looking at, you know, the interventions, and especially when you're doing as an operator from, you know, global perspective, how do you implement that? How do you amass all that and do it in a way that your decision making and bottom line impact is huge? So again, this whole field is immensely growing. And, you know, so is the focus within SPE within data science and engineering that we can not only support, you know, areas of production, you know, drilling completions, the whole spectrum of disciplines, end to end from early reservoir discovery all the way to production and, and also looking at, you know, abandonment. Sustainability and, and the environmental footprint. Yeah, great points, and it really integrates points together. I'm going to ask something that is related to both of you over here. I'll start with Sushma now. I'll change the order here. Are there any non-technical challenges that prevent the intensive application of data science, AI, machine learning in our industry today or future, or you can look back as well, but especially for today. And also, I will be more specific with this question. What would be the implications in your field, production and operations, Hammad? I'll start with Sushma on this one. Yeah, so as we look at, you know, the whole data science, engineering analytics, specifically for AI, you know, the non-technical, you know, we have a lot of ethical concerns, you know, how is the AI technology being used, you know, specifically making sure that it is not tainted with biases and there's fairness. So there's a huge area of that domain that still needs to be understood and explained because you can only go with, you know, certain, certain test sets and go with results that are still not fully understood. So how do you pursue, especially in the area where you need more precision, where you need, there's, you know, foolproof dependency, you have to make sure that there are legal regulatory elements that are being followed. And also, you know, like security vulnerability, you know, you can, you can get into areas where you have sort of worked with AI and ML with certain specific data, but is that really securely being used or is that being propagated into another area without the right ownership? So those kind of risks have to be understood. And also the other things that can be, you know, how are we making sure that our data that's being used is really the right data and so the results are all correct. So from non-technical perspective, there are many elements, especially in this growing AI ML area that need to be worked further. It has to be done with the consortium of industries and also done in a way that oil and gas can really progress this area. Thank you, Ahmad. In your field, what are the key points on this non-technical challenges? Yeah, two points. The first point about the people in the workplace and how much they're accepting the change. This is one of, you know, usually people with such a wave of change will resist it. And this is where we need to work on a very intensive program to have them aware of the huge benefits out of this new change. So another area which normally people, they overlook, which is the availability of the sufficient data in order to make the AI very effective and to give the results that we're expecting with the minimum uncertainties of high confidence. Usually, in some cases, the question that always the specialists are asking is, you know, how much data do I have? And is it too little or too much data? And if I don't have enough data, how would I be able to have the reliable data that can give me the results expected? And in normal cases, as per the normal approach of how to overcome this deficiency is in the inputs, you know, the specialists in the artificial intelligence and the data management, they do certain techniques in order to help the situation by either augmenting the data, synthesizing the data, or using and transferring the knowledge in order to have enough data that it can help them to achieve the results. But in this case, the drawback out of this is the bias that the data will bring because it's limited data. And all these techniques, they're bringing, they're amplifying the data from the false that it's by origin limited. I think this is the risk that I, you know, I believe that it could be better the full fledge of the full swing of the implementation of the AI nowadays. Thank you very much. Great points. Now, we have a total two minute each, actually, because time is going really fast here so that we can cover some questions from the audience. And I'm going to go into the people side of this one. What's your view on the people skills and training requirements, either within your discipline or beyond that, especially in the context of integration? I'll start with you, Sushma. Yeah, so that's a great question, Birol, because definitely, you know, people and talent are more instrumental in this growing area. So coming from, you know, from having worked in Shell with a multidisciplinary approach, I would definitely say that people who are coming from, say, petroleum engineering discipline or who are specialists, they have to embrace, you know, data sciences, you know, be very adept with AI ML, kind of emerging technologies, you know, they have to integrate that. And I already see and you may probably later comment about it. You know, universities like U of H, you know, our local university, international, they're already doing that. So the students, the coming talent, but also young professionals are mature people who are already in the in the oil and gas. They have to make sure they are skilled and that they're trained enough with what's happening right now in the industry. What will make a difference? And if you look at the business, they have high expectations. They are looking at more efficiency gains. They're looking at bottom line impact. They're trying to do more with less people. So again, the people can be more trained and adept in the data science skills. For example, you know, the students, they can easily learn Python, you know. In my days, we used to do Fortran and we did Java and C++. But do they understand and can they be very comfortable with things that data scientists might be doing? So the bottom line is you can be just coming from a purest, you know, one discipline. You have to be comfortable about working across the disciplines. You have to be learning data sciences. And the way I see from my lenses is you're looking at more from end to end value chain integration. You know, the data flows right from early exploration wells to development production, sustainability and so forth. So they can have their siloed approach. They have to be cognizant and develop more multidisciplinary skills and definitely, you know, enrich their education with data sciences, work with practitioners or pickups. So they are, you know, knowledgeable and they can also help data scientists and professionals who are teamed with them doing the work they want, getting the end results. Thank you very much. Great point. I guess in one way now I was in the industry now. I'm in academia. It looks like it has to start from school for the new generation at least. I want to take a point. I take a point. Now, Hamad, what's your take on this one, the talent side of it? I will start from where you end. What we need in order to have a skill and ensure that we prepare the talent and ensure that we get them assimilated effectively and that we have the right skills to do that. We need to prepare the talent and ensure that we get them assimilated effectively. In the workforce, we'll have to make sure that we start from the time of the schools by engaging with the universities to ensure that we have the AI material as structural in the curriculum of the universities. So this is the first step that we should start with. Now, once they graduate from the school, now it's the responsibility of the workplace to first to continue the cycle of the training and development while they're in job. And at the same time, prepare the workplace with the right resources, including the platform where or the open platform that they can have the full autonomy to code and interact and work with the application and all the coding and programming the way that will help them achieve the objective of the high competence in AI. Now, the third point that that also we need to focus on the collaboration in the workplace among us in the same workplace and across with with the data science and engineers in order to make sure that we work as a one team and join forces and and we will have to have both teams working together. You know, without this this collaboration that that they have to call it a noble. It has to be a noble collaboration order to achieve the best of the AI in the oil and gas industry. Great point it fuses back into integration as well as being ready from school and getting trained or retrained in the industry, I guess. Now, we have a little time to cover a number of questions from the audience. Since we have quite a bit of questions over here. I want the quicker answers if possible over here right to the point. I think that there's an interesting point over here, highlighted by surrender about a job. I mean, I'm a robot. What may be the limitations precautions for the use of AI ML in our oil industry. Not warning or precautions. That's an interesting one. Yeah, well, the limitations as I mentioned earlier, you know, definitely the the data dependency dependency is a big thing, you know, unless you have the data readiness and how much talk a little bit about it. You have to start from your end statement, you know, what are you trying to achieve, look at the problem, and then go backwards and see what is the critical data and work that so you don't need all the data but you need the data that will solve the problem. I talked about the biases. So we have to look at, you know, when we are testing our models. Are they fair. Are we looking at, you know, what what kind of, you know, devising we have to take so your results are really sound and they're applicable to all security is another area, regulation and compliance ethics. And also, how do you explain the results, you know, how do you do that. And also getting your staff ready for so AI is, you know, it may be ready, but you have to have all the different other elements for it. So that's that's my quick answer. Thank you very much. A quick one on this one. You know, I will, you know, I will take it another, you know, give it another backdrop by saying, you know, the data ethics. Now what we need is to make sure that even when we deal with with AI or the data management that we respect the code of ethics of the discipline of the profession. Now, this should this should include this should cover now the the data, the data security, the data property and to ensure that, you know, we we respect also and we respect that the results of the data regardless of our own biases. Now, this is one of the challenges that I see. It could be it could be in our way when when we have the full swing implementation of the AI in our workplaces. Excellent. So it is a great question. Another question from audience. So we don't have a lot of time. I have to pick over here. How do we measure data uncertainty reduction as it relates to unknown input? This is by Amin Amin from LinkedIn and biases. In other words, how can we make certain that there is actually uncertainty reduction in production operations data using AI? Can this be quantified? I guess it goes beyond this itself. It can be said for any other discipline or subdiscipline. I'll start with you, Hamad, on this one. Now, now the actual, usually when we there's, of course, you know, a lot of deterministic methods of how to quantify the uncertainties and the confidence level in any in any mathematical, you know, form form is equations. And this is known now. This is from from the from the technical or from the abstract side. Now, when you come when you come to to implement the AI, you know, you'll have to start from a baseline that you start from. And you need the baseline is the actual data that you have it. You build your model, you build your model, and you will have also to ensure that you have another means of how to how to benchmark with or how to cross check your model data with with the with the actual data that you have it. And one of the one of the examples that I can quote is since Amin is from the flow measurements, when we have the virtual meters with the results, we'll have in order to to check the credibility of the results, we'll have to match it with actual testing in order to ensure that the confidence is high or to gauge the confidence of the virtual meters once we develop it. Thank you. Excellent. Excellent points. Shishma, a couple of words on this one. Yeah, I like to hear from you. Well, again, I would say you have to make sure, you know, you are using the right data, but also you can get synthetic data, which is as close to the real and, you know, ensure you're doing the modeling and you you get the results and then you do with the real data because you if you're talking about precision, the more you repeat the data, the more you get the results. The more you repeat and there's the right testability with the right data, the better you are at warding off any kind of errors and risk. But definitely making sure you also engage your SMEs because they are the experts with its reservoir engineer or production technologies. They also have to sort of be involved and engaged in this. You cannot just rely completely on, you know, AI and the methodology. There's always augmentation of that human knowledge and wisdom along with what AI is providing. Excellent. It answers some of the questions regarding domain expertise. So I feel that we are just warming up on it. I wish we had one more hour on it, but we have to close. So I can just summarize a couple of things here. Both of you, including the audience questions, lead to a number of key points that we touched over here. Value can be added. It includes the timing related to aspects of it. Integration and data security and also right to access to data was also covered over here and also applications of data science and all these techniques, including integration, is highlighted here. And of course, domain expertise is again is going to be the key, especially in terms of reducing uncertainty and understanding the errors over here.

The Best of SPE Talks To,"questions for our next speaker. Hello I'm Trent and this is the S B. Podcast Today we have Mike Rainbolt, who has more than 40 years experience in the completions world, so he's a bonafide completions expert. He's also a senior technical adviser with a company called Abra Controls, which is doing some pretty interesting data acquisition stuff and consulting in the shale patch in the unconventional sector, and we're going to talk a little bit about what we saw the conference that was held in the Woodlands at the end of January. So with that, we're going to get right into it. Thanks. Hey, Mike. Thanks for joining us. Why don't you introduce yourself? Tell us a little bit about your experience where you come from and, uh, you know, kind of what you're working on these days, and then we'll get into the conversation. I'm a technical engineer at the Woodlands. Um, as you said, I'm with Aber controls. I'm a senior technical advisor. Aber does a lot of pressure monitoring and fracture driven interference or interaction analysis. I've also spent, uh, since 1972 in the oil field is roused about men as an engineer, production engineer, drilling engineer, completion engineer and have some experience internationally in Argentina and Canada. But my passion is completions and fracture stimulation design and fracture. Uh you know, you've written a few papers. So how many papers are you an author or co author on on this topic? We'll put some of the links in the show notes. Currently just in concerning fracture driven interactions. I'm co author in two papers and the lead author on the third paper. Okay. And so that's that's more than most people. And you know, I think that we saw each other in a few of the same paper sessions, the technical sessions at the show. And so I wanted to get your take on a few things because I know that you are a co author on one, but there were some interesting themes of the show. And so one of them was some updates on companies that have been doing sort of what the techniques called preloading or, you know, it has varying degrees. You can call it recharging. But essentially people are trying to put water down in a, uh, parent child well situation, putting the water down in the child well situation and then, uh, to sort of restore some balance and protect those child well. So you were an author on one of these update papers with Endeavor, right? And which is a shale producer in the Permian Basin. Yes, the lead author was, uh, Von Schurz and the paper numbers 1996 86. And what we did two years ago is we had a 22 well observation monitoring project that was going to be a preloading project. And we were able to do that to plan for, uh, fractured mitigation in this new project and endeavor was very successful doing that. As far as preloading that is beginning to achieve some popularity. Of course, the concerns I'm hearing from operators is the expense of doing it and the amount of, uh, you know, the successor having and dampening their . Uh, that's sort of the new technical term for what is colloquially known as frack hits. But, you know, some, you know, some people just call it fracture interference. But tell me a little bit more about just sort of the you know how you see how preloads work because I sort of I think we've all had to come up like a mental image of preloading. And I think that's a really good point. Because I think it's a really good point. And I think that is something that we see sometimes in commercial models because it is so unique. So what do you think? Why do you think preloading works? And is that even like the right term calling it preloading? Is that the one that's going to stick? Yes, there's actually a couple of different ways you can. You can preload, which means that you inject a certain amount of fluid into your well pre frack. And then there's the one that you can see here. And then they have pumps rigged up to where they can continue the injection when they see a pressure inflection occur in the offsetting well. The third type is continuous injection. And I actually have a client that did a side by side comparison of preloading versus continuous injection to see which technique was the most effective. And the goal of preloading and continuous injection, really, it's one to protect the well bore, the existing well bore from sand influx or outright casing damage like you see in SP paper 191712. The other thing is they're trying to protect the existing assets, reserves and production rate. And number three, and this one is getting more and more popular, is using the preloading or the continuous injection to enhance the effectiveness of the stimulation in the new well. And I have seen cases where the new well is performing better preloading than it did without it. In fact, 191712, that was its main point was they were using it to get enhanced production from the new wells. Man, I have a lot of questions about preloading. And yes, I've seen actually with my own eyes the active defense or what you're calling the on demand preloading from a Braxis. And it's just, it's super, you know, it's actually super frustrating to be on the surface at a completion site when you're really always thinking about what's happening down two miles below. But what so but let's open that up. I mean, why? Why is this working? Is it is it creating a pressure shield? Are we talking about stress changes? Um, poor pressure changes? How does the just putting water down really, really mitigate or help keep fractures in the productive zone that operators are really turning the target? This this technique and I was in a course yesterday with Ali Donahue, and he's pointing out this these preloads and injections really work with wells that have mostly liquid rich reservoirs like oil and water with very little gas because liquids are less compressible, much less compressible than gases. And what happens when you preload or inject is that you're actually Chevron actually calls it pushing back where you're you have an incompressible fluid in there, and you're putting enough resistance so that migrating fluids from the new well run into resistance and cannot overcome what you're you're pumping into the to the old well, and that's that's the basis of the techniques. You're you're you're just basically fighting water with water, as the Braxis article said, or you're making something that it's more difficult for the invading fluids to reach your old well or invade their fracture systems. Um yeah, I want to talk about the cost because you know, this is sort of when you talk to new adopters, that's that's one of like the first things they say is they talk about, you know, trying to like, Well, okay, we're starting here, but we want to sort of bring things down. So what are the cost drivers? What are the things that the companies who have been doing this for 12 to three years? What have they learned on how to sort of scale this? Well, let's let's talk about these one person that's preventing sand influx into well into wells. This is pretty popular in the Bakken Reservoir and also places like the Eagleford, where it's the place where it's not uncommon to have to do 250 to $300,000 clean out after new well frac ops and so they can get as high as half a million. You can you can and that's and that's with no well bore damage like stuck tubing or something else. So the state the cost potential of not having to do a cost cost clean out is well worth the preloading and preventing that. In fact, that's that's why Braxis is doing their job. They're doing their job to make sure that they're getting the right injections just strictly to prevent sand influx. Sometimes they see a little bump in production, too. But the 350,000 as you said, $500,000 clean out jobs are prohibitively expensive. Yeah and so. So but what is what is the water total usage? Because you know, one of the things that made Braxis a little bit more difficult to do was they had to have a water system on that lease, and so they actually were able to control water cost very much. But what have you seen in terms of water usage and just even ballpark or general terms or people starting high and then going down low to reduce costs and see if they can still get the same sort of protection. That's that's a great question. Here in SB 191712. The technique was this first order well first order well, second order offset well received 10,000 barrel load. I'm working with operators right now that typically 30 to 50,000 barrels per well and in the case in the one case of continuous injection that I know of, we pumped 170,000 barrels of water into that from about three weeks prior to the beginning of frac ops until the end of frac at frac ops, and we did that in accordance with the Huntington Beach, California technique in the first order. And every 10,000 barrels you shut down and measure ISP. We saw a beautiful increase in ISP is with time and the technique was quite successful. You mentioned the Huntington Beach. That was a workshop. Why was it now two years ago? I fractured driven interaction mitigation workshop over there in California and you know, I wasn't there, but everybody that was always always brings it up, but I'll do the shameless plug. I mean, you know, I think that's something that's really important for people in these rooms and being a part of the S B E and a part of the discussion is so important for people. Um if you're if you're engaged anywhere in the world, whether it's China, Argentina or the US or Canada or Russia and hydraulic fracturing, uh, you know, being in these dialogue sessions is something that could actually shorten your your learning curve by years. You know, maybe not 10 years, but maybe a year or so. Um and I think you mentioned earlier, you know, on how you've you know, reflecting on what you saw at the conference the other week. You know, are people catching on to these things pretty steadily and learning from each other? How is that knowledge transfer working? That that's that's great comment. Just briefly at Huntington Beach. One of the things two things that they stressed was that poor cement around your pipe can cause can cause a lot of damage to your pipe during during the stages. The other thing they mentioned was extreme limited entry perforating and shortly after that I noticed operators were sort of reluctant to, uh, consider the limited entry perforating, but at the HTFC this time I ran into a number of operators that they are that they are migrating towards the limited entry technique with ever shorter cluster spacing to improve cluster spacing. And that tremendously helps mitigate fracture driven interactions because you don't have one or two really long fractures that are that are, uh, as I say, leaving the reservation and going way under other wells that have no benefit to either the old wells that they're in contacting or to the new well. Yeah, I've heard him called the runways runaways. That's great. Okay. Well, we're going to pause it there. We're going to take a quick break because I do want to talk about limited entry and hydroelectric fracturing technology conference. Um, and we'll be right back with Mike.

Learn more at spe.org slash e-mentoring. Hey, so Mike, we just got done sort of unpacking, um, a lot of, uh, you know, perspective on, on the preloading, but it sort of dovetails into another topic for me a little bit, because you mentioned, uh, the continuous injection using over a hundred thousand barrels and we've seen passive preloads use those kind of numbers too. Um, you Devin had a really good presentation about a year or so ago about how they were, um, uh, looking at different sizes. But, uh, I, you know, when you get to a hundred thousand is when you're, you're close to the order of the actual or the original stimulation, but it's not quite a refract, but then you flip, uh, the dial and you start pumping in that water at a higher rate and it is a refract. And we saw, we both saw a paper, um, on refactoring and uh, in one of the takeaways I had, and I put this on my social media feeds was that it is, it is as more people delve into refracturing, they're learning. It is more technically difficult than I think we first assumed a few years ago when refracturing caught a lot of buzz. And I, you know, I was part of that. I wrote about that too, because there was a lot of papers, a lot of potential, but now we're learning that, you know, as, as one person presenting on this from an operator, they said it's harder than the original completion junk. And I think that's the reason why we're learning that, because it's the original completion job itself. So can you give me your perspectives on on how refraction plays into things? Yes, the paper that we both watched there at the HFTC. They went through how they had technical challenges, uh, installing the liner. They were running the liner, and then they were, uh, they have, then they were cutting it off. That didn't work. So then they ran liners with liner hangers. But even with that, they were economically successful with their refrax and these wells that have that originally had spacings of 100 or 200 ft between clusters. Those are those are really good candidates for finding stranded reserves. Robert Barrett presented 195962 in Canada and showed how you can see these stranded reserves and get them through the refraction process. The I think the most important thing is going to catch on because it is it is viable technique. Mechanically we're going to have to come up with easier solutions to cut down on costs. But once you get your new casing installed or you liner, it's pretty much goes like a regular frac. You perforate plug perforate plug frac, and it's a normal operation. Well, it's been one minute dissecting. You know what refrax are. You kind of laid out three different versions of the preload, and I'm sure there's a fourth or fifth out there somewhere being used. And if you throw in surfactants, I guess you call that the fourth version of that. But the sticking just to refrax. You know, there's bull heading, and then there's the mechanical isolation AKA liner refrax. And so both of them seem to have different drivers, different outcomes, different reasons why you would want to do them. Can you talk to me about those? Yes In some cases, it's not possible to run new liners, or refrax. They're not as effective as the old ones. So what operators are doing is they're just rigging up on the surface and pumping fluid and sand down the down the casing without with maybe dropping frac pods or doing some other diverter agents and working the fracks down hole. And from what I can tell there, they're being successful. I know that about 10 years ago with another operator I was working for, they try to refraq bull heading, and they're not as effective as the old ones. So they're not as effective as the old ones. So in fact, we've made a lot of progress since then, and now we can now without isolation. In some cases, the Wells will tolerate being both bullhead fracked, and we're having economic success success doing that. And I think there was even a paper talking about, you know, great cycling to to optimize bullheads. So when we talk about bullheads, you're literally just sending the water down the wellhead. You're just sending the water down the wellhead. So you're just sending the water down the wellhead fracked new clusters. But it's just going to go into them. You know, it's going to find the path of least resistance, essentially, and that's why you see that that bias on where the fluids actually go. But then people are talking about cycle the rates and you let this part take a little then you start pumping up again, and then that the toe will take a little bit more. So people are sort of trying to even fine tune something that's really a blunt point. And I think that's probably the most important thing that was less mentioned at the show, but we know this, you know, just from past reporting and past events is that you know, this is why refracts play into, uh, interference, fracture interference mitigation is because you are recharging the reservoir to the end, you know, almost as much as you can, you know, feasibly do. And so we're seeing. But then when you talk about the liner refrax, you're talking about the refraction of the well. Do you agree or? Yes, it something there. There we need to. We do need to mention that a fracture mitigation technique number four is refracturing. People are refracturing their well either shortly before the new front well frac ops or maybe during the new well frac ops and this and that is also being successful. But refrax as a standalone project for people who are trying to mitigate the risk of refraction, recovery and existing. Well, that's also viable. But the refracturing actually got started, as I understand it by people trying to mitigate fracture interference events with refracturing. Yeah, we've heard that it's a hard stat to pull depend down right there, but it but it is. They're two different beast. And so when we talk about refracture refracturing going forward for the future, it's going to be a little bit more difficult because when I look at the line of refract one of the comments in the paper that we're talking about, we'll post a link to it on on the show notes, but it was from Devon. It was an excellent, excellent thorough paper. Where you really got the. Sort of do a day in the life of a refracturing team and go through the decision making processes. And you know, I worked a little bit in the well intervention space when I came into the business, and I remember the one when I asked you to do a refracture. I said, Yeah, I'm going to do that. And you can imagine, you know, popping open the hood of a 57 Chevy with your eyes closed. You know, you're you're you don't know what's in that engine until you till you go in and you feel it with your fingers. And so when you go into a lot of these wells, like you said, we're starting to know, uh, learning more about casing ovulating, perforation erosion from production. Um may you know, so there's all these issues that actually come up in the process. And you know, we're going to be able to do that in the background. And so that's what we know. I think a few years ago, people thought the pool of these things was was massive. Um and what we're learning is that it takes a dedicated meticulous team with certain skill sets that go that add on to completions. You can't just be a good at completions. You have to be good at well intervention to do this. So so going forward while you think it has like wide applicability, you know, you're going to be able to do it in a very simple and yet expensive operation. If you're going to do the liner version, that's exactly right. And not only do you need, uh, you know, company personnel that are that are used to doing these, but also you would want your work over services like your work over rig in your frac company to get them used to the refactoring nuances because there's going to be some reduced rate. There's going to be some, uh, prop property, uh, profit design changes as you're pumping and you're going to be able to get into the groove. I think I think there's a lot of opportunity out there for companies to make more money out of existing production, and it does seem like an area right for more technology innovation, even though you know you can do it with with whatever's off the shelf today. Um, but just to make the life of a refract team easier, it does. You know, um, this is without any sort of insider information. It just you just look at this and you're like, there's got to be a few, you know, technology plays here. And then you're like, there's got to be a few more details. So we got you for a few more minutes, and I wanted to, uh, uh, jump to, uh, another topic from HFTC. Um and that was another Devon paper actually from, uh, Kyle Hoss bite a engineer with, uh, with Devon, and he presented the case well bore monitoring method to the audience. So we're going to unpack that one in a second. Are you looking for a group of like minded individuals? S P E technical sections are communities of S P E members who come together to share ideas, promote competence and develop projects related to their technical interest. They primarily meet virtually, but do hold face to face meetings at least once a year to learn more. Go to S P E dot org and search technical sections. All right. Thanks, Mike. We're going to talk now about sort of the last topic that we have you in here for today. Um, and it's, uh, it was, it was an interesting paper to see presented by Devon because they offered what it would amount into a way to use a unpro, an unperfed well bore that has not been hydraulically fractured yet and use it almost like a fiber optic proxy. Um, and so you can see what's happening in the subsurface by monitoring very small pressure changes and a virgin well bore. So can you, can you talk to me a little bit about how you saw this paper? Maybe give us the 30,000 foot view of like its meaningfulness. Yes. Uh, and, uh, Kyle Haas fight is a friend of mine and brilliant young, young man. The technique is actually right out of a civil engineering 101 book. You're looking at a deform deformation caused by an impact, the squeezing action of a, of a fracture and that deformation causes a small pressure bump in the, in the, uh, well bore that you can detect at the surface. That's one of the appeals of this technique. You must have a sealed well bore and it must be completely full of water in order to see these. But when you detect them, what the tech, what they're doing is they're monitoring the surface pressure was with, of course, high, high resolution gauges and Kyle is running DPT, differential pressure to look for a change in slope in that. And then when he sees it, then they do the second derivative and the second derivative and you can see when the, when the slope change ends and that is, that is a shows up very nicely as an impact of the casing. What that's telling you is, you know when the fracturing from an, from the new well has reached the old well, then you can make the decision of what do you need to do to the frac design on the next stage to increase your volume of first response. You want that delayed as much as possible because if you have an early a fracture volume of first response, that means you're communicating with the wells very, very fast and you're, and you're not, you know, effectively stimulating the new well, you want to delay the, what we could just call it Voffer and what they do is they make a change to the perforating scheme, maybe slow the rate down and then they, then they, then they, then they're watching and they already know what to expect a Voffer would have been had they not changed anything and then they can judge whether or not they've succeeded in making their fracturing design more efficient, but the technique is viable. It does work and I was going to ask George King. George, if you're listening, what does that, if we can see that inflection on surface, can you convert that to a frac to a casing load? Because George is a specialist in casing failures and stuff now. And that was, I was going to ask that question, but there was just too many people there at the panel. Okay. Yeah. You're referencing the casing deformation panel, which we had George come in a few months ago actually to help preview and tease out. But no, that's an interesting other application, but there's actually so many things that it looks like you can potentially do with this. The sealed well board monitoring technique, but you mentioned involving the first response. I mean that in itself is sort of a new concept. Am I right on that? Yes, this is this is again is and let me give full credit to Devon. This is something that they identified. It's all related to timing and what I can tell you is from doing numerous case studies. Sometimes you see the volume of first response at 2000 barrels pumped. If you assume that half of that went in both directions, then that means before you've even finished pad, you're communicating with the old well. And if and in that case, then you know that you're you're probably wasting some frac fluid and prop and because of the early communication problem. And that's that's a great way to look at. So we talked about pre loading trying to prevent ending up with sand and apparent well board. But if you if you have earlier than expected communication with an offset parent well, then what you need to realize is you're sending capital over there to a depleted zone. And that's where decision making starts to need to happen on that stage of the next stage. So this is where we start to roll out the idea of real time frac, which which Devon says this method enables and the volume the first response if I could just characterize, I guess the end goal here, the worst goal would be to get the you start pumping. Like you said on the pad, um, stage and then you get early communication in minutes. Um the best scenario is that you're 600 ft away from your parent and that you've pumped 100% of your sand and water without seeing a response. The realistic scenario maybe is that you see, uh, you pump 75% of your slurry mix and then see a response and you keep pumping a little bit more and like you're trying to toggle that and slow it down. So can I take that 75% make it 80 make it 85 is that that's that's kind of what we're talking about, right? That's correct. One of my diagnostic plots that I do is a percent of stage load versus, uh, you know, time and with the F D I plotted on there and what you can see what what happens is for plug and perf is as soon as the ball in, then you start looking for any sort of pressure changes in the offsetting well and these pressure changes can start at say 10% or 20% of the of the of the load that you intend to pump or it could be delayed to over 50% more times than not. I'm seeing that before you finish pad, you've got a fracture driven interaction and progress and then you look at the slope, the what we call in 179 173 the slope intensity and you try to model forward and see what the possible magnitude total growth magnitude is on that F D I say if it's gonna be 300 PSI total by the time you're done pumping or maybe over 2000 and then you can decide do I need to change something or just go to flush? Yeah, this is amazing stuff because I think it's easy to take for granted what we're talking about here, you know, and watching this this evolution. You know, this wasn't something that people were talking about five years ago at all and and and it definitely leads to fracture propagation control. In other words, you know, instead of just sticking to the design that was based on, you know, your stats and your models, you're going to listen to the rock this time and you're you're going to change just by virtue of seeing these signals. This is what actually something like this is actually what's more likely than anything I've ever seen to move operators away from geometric completion designs because when you look at that data, it's just so hard not to want to make a change. You know, knowing what you what you can gain by by talking, toggling the dials here, but let me on a related topic is the issue that very passionate for you to talk about is time. So I think that's a very important issue to talk about is time. And so when we see these slopes at present in presentations and papers, one thing we need to understand is that this is in this is based on an array of sensors, whether they're on the same pad or different pads. But usually we're talking about the same pad and multiple well heads. If these things are not time sinked, if the sensors are not time sinked, then you have a lot of trouble in the analysis. You know, real time might be out the window if pressure sensors are off in either direction by five minutes. So can you just elaborate on on what the industry is learning? Because we're starting to hear more operators put a bullet point in their presentations on this. Make sure that you know, you know what time sink means and make sure you have it on these sensors. Yeah, that's that's a that's a great point. When I wrote SP paper 189853, the ESP pump and the service company clocks were different. I mean, they were really different and it was a struggle to try to to try to get those two data sets to line up. What happens, what we do is all of our clocks in our sensors are timed to the Internet and corrected continuously through network time protocols to Internet time. So for instance, in one nine four three four nine with EE with Endeavor, we had 22 sensors out and we even put sensors on the treatment wells. So we had 22 sensors out and we had 22 sensors out and we even put sensors on the treatment wells. Now when I go to do my analysis looking for FD eyes, everything is lined up. I have I have 22 different data channels and I've got one time access. If you don't know what time your reference time is in the other clocks and you say, oh, my offer was 2000 barrels in this well, or it was 6000 barrels in the next stage. You really don't know because you don't know if you if you're running from the CSV files of the service company. Now there's what we can do too is we can ask our service providers to check their computer against our cell phone and verify that they are reasonably close to Internet time. That way when you go when the engineer goes to do the analysis, it makes his or her life much easier. But since all of our sensors are on Internet time, I can literally have plots drawn in just a few minutes because I don't have to worry about synchronization and we call it atomic reference time, which Internet time is eventually tied to the cesium fountain clocks in Boulder, Colorado and around the world. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that one. So we have but that's just having having a certain reference time is makes analysis so much easier and eliminates a lot of uncertainty. Well, let me ask you this. I mean, so you've had to deal with these struggles before you were with Abra, you know, you as an operator, you were trying to reconcile some of these data sets. And so, you know, one of the things that that, you know, if you can comment on if we're telling people that, you know, here's some of the things you need to know about quality data quality and quality control here is is don't try to manipulate these things manually. There's something called peak to peak that you guys have talked about a little bit where people are trying to line up the interactions, the fracture interactions and you and your brain might actually want them to be overlaying, but you're missing the fact that you're that these signals are delayed from well to well. So these are when these fractures move, they maybe are moving at 40 feet a minute, not light speed. And so when you see some when you see some charts, you always have to think about where slopes the peaks of the slopes matched together. And is that is that a major pitfall? Yes, it is. If you're if you're using peak to peak, what that tells me is that you have no idea what your reference time is. The only thing you can do is is line them up on possibly common events at the end of the day. All you really have is a yes or no answer. So what I would encourage all the listeners here is however you're collecting data, verify your time reference for each clock. Otherwise, you really don't know what within with certainty what's going on. Yeah, if you take Mike's advice, you could be like sort of the data hero in your in your department for for figuring this out. Well, here's the worst part. And you mentioned a little bit what you can what some analysts will do. And it's really tempting is they'll make the data look like they think it should look like. And that's not valid engineering. Right. But it's so tempting to say, well, I'll just I'll just shift it over here. That looks good. No, no. If you can't if you if you can't line it up, just admit you can't line it up. You've got an FDI, but that's"
Staying Strong with Shauna Noonan,"I'm Jason Notouris and this is SPE Talks to Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SPE podcast. If you haven't subscribed yet, we encourage you to do so. It's a great way to keep up with the latest oil and gas technical trends and valuable information. As is our monthly tradition, 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan is joining us now virtually. That's our new tradition. And sadly also, Shana, this is going to be the last time that you join us to talk about your presidential column. Yes, it is. And I will say that I am not necessarily going to miss having to write these monthly columns, mainly because I'm more of a technical writer or actually I'm not even much of a writer. So this was actually a huge development curve for me. And I was adamant that I was going to write my own articles that necessarily hasn't been done in the past by former presidents. And it would take days of just sitting down and focusing and trying to get not only thoughts together, but something that was actually cohesive, I guess, for lack of a better term. So now I've got spare time. I can go out and improve my golf game and my hobby of skeet shooting instead of hunkering down and trying to stay focused writing these columns. But I am proud with the body of work that I was able to put up. Not only writing the columns, you took it one step further. And this is the first time that we've had the podcast where you bring a president in to speak about the columns, which I think has been a great way to reach people as well. Exactly. Now, looking back at your presidency, I know we mentioned in the opening that we were in studio for a while doing these podcasts. And then, you know, once COVID hit, it became virtual to be able to record these. Members have asked me before, and I'm sure they've asked you too, whether or not there's any disappointment the way that your presidency has been split up, the latter portion of which being so affected by the pandemic and the crash of the oil prices. Yeah, actually, I get asked this question quite a bit. And to be honest, I am I'm not disappointed. I made a point as I was incoming president to visit as many sections and speak at many events as I could. A lot of it was just collecting feedback from our members, because, again, we're a member driven organization. The role of S.B. president is just so much more than just handing out awards, going to conferences and visiting sections. You know, you're also chair of the board of directors. And this time it was critical to serve as that chair and guide our society through the worst situations of our history. And I really look at it as an inflection point. You know, it's requiring us to anticipate how to deliver on our mission to our members in a post pandemic world. And, of course, you know, it's even made more challenging because this is S.B.E.'s worst financial crisis in its history. We rely on our events for our revenue for revenue for many of our programs, about 70, 75 percent. And it's not only. You know how financially, how it's impacted this year with all these cancellation and postponements. But now that people have tasted coming virtually to the events, how how is that actually even going to change our business model? And really, the financial hit for S.B.E., it's it's going to it's going to take several years for us to correct. But I do want our members to be reassured that, you know, we know we're in a cyclical industry and financially S.B.E. was prepared to ride out financial crisis as such as this. However, we weren't necessarily set to ride through a multi year crisis. But don't worry, S.B.E. is still going to be there to serve as members and continue on with this program. Now, I do want to say, though, you know, the board, we've been having to meet quite frequently because situation at one point, situation is changing daily and the term remote. It it's kind of strange in the fact that by being together remotely as a board, we actually got closer. It's kind of strange to say, because now we're seeing people instead of cross a conference table, we're actually getting a glimpse inside their homes. And we're getting to see, you know, or hear their children or their their dogs or even to. We've had a few meetings where we've seen a few dogs and jump up on people's laps. So it's been entertaining in some strange regard. Are you considering becoming an S.B.E. member? When you join S.B.E., you join a society of dedicated professionals just like you, working to address the technical challenges of the global oil and gas industry. S.B.E. membership gives you the opportunity to make local and global connections and build a network of influential technical leaders from every discipline. Learn more at S.B.E. dot org slash join. I appreciate everything you're saying, because to me, I'm looking at this almost as practical optimism, which kind of ties into what you established when you when you first were handed the gavel in Calgary in 2019 at ATCE, because you outlined these goals. And while I'm looking through these goals, I'm thinking, OK, the headline of the goal, despite the pandemic, despite the oil crash, that headline is not changing. Maybe some of the content of it does. But you established goals when you came in as a president. So can you go ahead and talk about those? Definitely. And I wanted to make sure that my last column was giving an update on what we and even though I set out the goals, the work that's being done, it's a we. It's it's the board. It's S.B.E. staff. So I wanted to update everybody on how we've come along. And again, my the theme of my presidency was S.B.E. And who who knew back then that it was going to take on additional meaning as we ride through this rough time? And of course, there's been the adaptation now, the S.B.E. Stay strong, which has been used to message hope and guidance to our members. Now, I still have about two and a half months at the time of this recording in my presidency to still get a lot of these initiatives towards achieving these goals completed. And also, I still have the just over a year when I'm actually past president to ensure that what has been implemented is sustainable. But let's start with the first goal, in which I thought was I shouldn't say the most important because they're all important, but it was strengthening the quality of our technical content. And, you know, I'm proud to say that there's been quite a bit done. Again, it has to do with a lot of the work with program committee members. They're now really working and mentoring more with the authors to ensure the quality of the papers that go into one petro or are high quality. Now we're able to track when there is a paper submitted into a conference that gets flagged by a session chair or program committee person that it needs a little tweaking to increase the quality. We can actually use that now as a benchmark for monitoring the progress and quality improvement. So hopefully the number of papers that do get flagged by the program committees will go down. And Shauna, with bringing in the virtual presentations, is there anything new there with how the progress in the processes are running? People are having to pre-record their presentations and turn them in for these virtual conferences. I know that there's been some that's been done live stream, but what I've seen most recently is more on the pre-take presentations and then the live Q&A. And what that actually does is it finally gives for the first time, session chairs to actually pre-screen and possibly ask for revisions on the presentation side of these. So that that's actually been an interesting silver lining. Now, when it comes to then the manuscripts that get turned in for peer review, one of the things we really needed to do was to streamline and improve the time it took for paper to get into completed through the whole peer review process. And I will say that the pandemic has not impacted the huge improvement. And I was really proud to announce that the number of days for paper to complete peer review has declined by about 40% when compared to last year. And that's huge. You know, I still remember times when a paper would take almost a year and a half to go through peer review. And really, by the time it actually then appears in our peer review journals, it almost seemed obsolete. And I'm really hoping that this is going to attract more authors to submit papers for publication in our peer review journals. Now, I did have the concern that if all of a sudden we started opening the floodgates of papers coming in into peer review, that our technical reviewers will be swamped. But, you know, the more volunteers we can get to do technical peer reviews, you know, and it is a very rewarding experience. I did it for many years and actually I'm still going to continue to do it as well. You know, we should be able to handle this this onslaught. Shawna, you mentioned tracking the technical papers. What's been done in the past to do that and what can be done in the future to further enhance this? Well, it was one of my final initiatives under strengthening the quality was finding a way to properly track or trend it. And I realized it is a qualitative, not necessarily quantitative, but again, you were engineers with like numbers. So what had been done in the past, a lot of members don't realize, but for conferences, we used to do a technical quality index that was derived based on answers from post-event surveys. And it was quite useful when I was on the board running the meetings and training board committees because we could actually trend over time if the perceived quality of content was going down for an event. So then we could actually get in there and intervene. Unfortunately, that index hasn't been used much in the last few years. It's something I kind of wanted to resurrect, but again, not only resurrect, but one of the big problems is if you're taking data from post-event surveys, you actually need people to fill them up. And you see the percentage of people that do that is very small. But now we're doing hybrid and virtual events and people are now able to access a lot of the on-demand content. There's got to be some way in the virtual space to be getting more feedback on the quality of papers. And we get asked by many members to, well, why don't you do something like the Amazon rating system within OnePetro? You know, we did try something like that a few years ago. The problem with that is you can get people to skew or it could get biased really, really quick with that system. So this is still a goal that I'm planning to accomplish during my time on the board. It's just we still don't have a clear path yet on how to do that. So that is outlining the first of five core areas you want to address, strengthening the quality of our technical content. The next goal was around strengthening the tools and methods that SBE uses to disseminate knowledge to its members. Yes. Now, this initiative was really just trying to find all the different ways we can get our quality content out. You know, we've done it in print, obviously, through papers and through our magazines. But I really want to expand into doing video and audio, obviously, that's these podcasts, and also to make it not easily consumable and accessible via mobile devices. Because now a lot of us are doing our reading or listening through our iPhones and tablets. I really wanted to hit the ground running on this early. So I was really pushing these initiatives as I was incoming president. So we were able to have a lot of this launched by the time I was president. And it was it was very fortunate that we did have this underway because, you know, at the start of the pandemic, when everybody was under lockdown, we were still we were able to use all these different ways to disseminate our content. Now, I'm very proud with the podcast. I remember right when I was first getting onto the board as incoming, I was challenging the staff saying, look, OK, we need to get podcasts up and running. Because starting with my very first column, I want to do a podcast. It's been amazing how it's grown. Last time I looked, there was over 38 podcasts and still growing and over 30,000 downloads, which I think is fantastic. Kudos to you, Jason, because you are the driving force behind this. So I appreciate that very, very much. Oh, thank you. It's a pleasure. So keep keep keep it up. Let's keep those podcasts going. And that's one thing we're trying to understand, too, with the new business model is how can we generate revenue? So maybe one of the things we'll start seeing is possibly ads other than SBE ads in the podcast. Just same as same as everybody else. Now, absolutely. Ads, sponsors. I think I think now is a good time just to plug it, right? If you're interested in an ad or sponsorship of the podcast, email podcast at SBE.org. Let us know. Yeah, because we now have we have the data to show that these podcasts are being listened to en masse. So that is absolutely fantastic. And then now then there is the video series, the SBE Stay Strong, which are only accessible to members and they're featured on the app. That got launched in May and now it features over 32 short videos on technical and non-technical topics. And one of them might promote is Aaron Burton's instructional series on hydraulic fracturing. He's got a five part series on that app. This app is a key to trying to disseminate a lot of not this information, access a lot of our virtual and live stream media. And the one thing I still don't quite understand is almost all our members have a mobile device, but we have such a small percentage that have the app actually installed. So it's one of the things I'm really going to be trying to market and get the message out to people is, you know, you're going to you're going to be missing the boat on content and notifications and things that are only going to be streamed or made available. Through that app. So we need more and more people to download. And when I said a small percentage, the last numbers that I saw, you know, for our membership, we have approximately 150,000 members, half being students, half being professional members. But we have like less than 20,000 people have actually downloaded the app. So we need a we need a lot more of that. And adding on to that presentation videos are also now starting to appear in OnePetro. So that's also so unique and exciting. Yes. And it started with OTC 2020. So when that was canceled, about 80% of the authors agreed to record their presentations. And now when you go into OnePetro, you can download the paper and or you can also listen to the presentation. And that is now going to be occurring at the scale conference is was like that, as well as ERTEC, which recently happened and LATPEC, which is and the HSC International HSC Conference. Again, it's silver lining that instead of people that would prefer to actually listen to the content and see the presentation in the conference of their home, as opposed to just downloading a paper and reading it, it gives more options. But one of the things we're now having to do is SBE from an infrastructure position is especially in the video space. And even, for example, even with these podcasts, as we start amassing that content, we have to develop new platforms from which people can filter and search for the information that we need. And that's one of the things that we manage, even though we're in a financial crunch, the SBE Foundation has provided the funds for us to work and develop these platforms to the benefit of our members. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SBE programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other SBE members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location or experience level. To learn more about the League of Volunteers, visit spe.org. So the third core of strengthening SBE revolves around strengthening the content and activities for the disciplines and the fundamentals for the membership. There's been a term that's been used within the board and within our membership on expanding the tent, expanding the tent. We need to grow members, we need to reach the non-traditional disciplines, we need to expand into downstream, midstream. And I was really concerned that we were diluting the offerings and the focus on those traditional disciplines that make up our industry. It's basically drilling, completions, productions, operations. I won't go into too much detail because that was a recent column and a recent podcast that I did. But I'm happy to say that we're still focusing on bringing new technical sections that are focusing on the core disciplines to light. Like just recently at the June board meeting, a new technical section covering artificial lift and dilification was approved. We're working on creating a hydraulic fracturing technical section and a new engagement hub, a pilot. The first focusing on the drilling discipline as the pilot is under development where it's creating new and exclusive content to our SBE members that have drilling as their primary discipline in their profile. By the way, it's very important that people keep their SBE profiles up to date because that's not only data for us, but also too, that's going to be key for what you are able to access when we start rolling out exclusive content. Now, most importantly, our virtual live and on demand events, panels and webinars, they are now able to reach our members in the field locations and then those that are in field locations again are of our core discipline. So now all SBE members, regardless of their location and time zone, can benefit from these knowledge exchanges. Again, that strengthens up the value proposition for someone in our core disciplines to be an SBE member. And I'm seeing how all these cores are kind of building onto each other to really strengthen SBE working together. And so looking now at your fourth goal, that was strengthening the knowledge transfer and unconventional resources, which dives a little bit deeper into the disciplines and the fundamentals. So the unconventional shells, they're crucial to our industry being able to deliver on future energy demand. And I'm just not talking the shells in the United States. I'm talking globally. Now, while knowledge sharing within the U.S. players is ongoing, as I was traveling, I saw there was minimal dialogue and knowledge transfer on a global scale. It really seemed to be a mindset of, well, if it wasn't invented in our shell basin, it's not going to be applicable to us. Instead of trying to take on all the shell developments globally, I focus more on the Vaca Morda, which is in Argentina. And it has the potential for that country to realize energy security, just like the Permian Basin unconventionals have done for the United States. So what I was able to do was in March, we had a Vaca Morda strategic discussion that occurred between the local stakeholders and the SBE technical directors. And I brought on the SBE technical directors, not just because of their expertise in their discipline. I was blessed at this time on the board of having technical directors that were also considered industry experts and unconventionals. And that discussion, albeit small, because this was right at the beginning of the pandemic and companies, they were restricting employees from coming to events such as this. It was really successful in the fact that we all got a better understanding of what the development challenges were with the Vaca Morda. There was really good sharing of some best practices that were done in other parts of the world. And then we also learned from the local stakeholders ways that they wanted SBE to assist them. When I mean assist, help contribute to the success of them unlocking the potential of the Vaca Morda. And I really hope now that that session can serve as a template to be repeated for other unconventional basins globally. And I do also want to mention that I was very proud to see that at ERTEC that we were seeing actually several papers and presentations on the Vaca Morda. So we're now starting to see that cross communication, pollination between the US basin players and the players of the Vaca Morda. So that was a big check for me. And getting to your fifth, to me, I mean even take away the effects of the global pandemic. This one looks like it's the most challenging for various reasons. And I'm excited to hear what your update is on this. The fifth goal is strengthening the feedstock of incoming talent into our industry. Yeah, you're not kidding that this was the most challenging and it was the most challenging a couple years ago. You know, against the pandemic. And as I travel to the sections, it's the perception of the oil and gas industry and the challenges for getting that incoming talent is different. There are actually, there are regions out there where there is no impediment or concern of people wanting to have a career in oil and gas. Whether it was from environmental concerns or, oh my goodness, peak oil. That means then there is not going to be a career for petroleum engineer. It really comes down to increasing the awareness, not necessarily at the college level, but again back into the schools. And this is where the Energy for Me program is so important. And I've been so pleased that one SBE brought back a dedicated staff member to revamp our whole Energy for Me program. And if folks haven't gone out to the Energy for Me website in the last year, please go and check it out because it is, it was a lot better. Contains some great industry information and we also started another site with more of a Fueling Our Future blog. And it also contains a lot of good links to energy and industry reports from outside of SBE. Again, just finding different ways to reach out to people that want to learn more about all the forms of energy and the energy transition. And then directing them to our sites and our stories to again properly educate. One thing I've also seen during the pandemic is a lot of our members are doing some of the Energy for Me experiments or energy education through Twitter, LinkedIn. And I think that's fantastic. One of the most recent ones that I saw was a series that was done in Saudi Arabia, done in Arabic to help educate the children. And our regional director for Latin America and the Caspian, Cesar Patino, he's put it full throttle. He's doing Energy for Me tweeting out these short clips and experiments almost on a weekly basis. And again, we need to capture that. During my time as outgoing president, I focused more on helping our Energy for Me initiatives and energy education. Because that is going to be critical for, again, strengthening the feedstock. And for everyone listening, we will put a link to the Energy for Me website in the show notes of this so that you can easily access it. Shawna, we've now covered your five core goals heading into your presidency. But looking back, I'd like to hear from you personally, what are some of your favorite moments that you've had as a president? There are so many. And I look back on all the pictures and the mementos and that of my travels. But there are a few that do stand out. I got to go to the United Nations. The Geneva section hosted an event talking with their director of sustainability initiatives. Going to the LNG plant in Papua New Guinea. And actually, that's the picture that accompanies my article in the JPT. Touring the universities and seeing areas of research. And then also to the companies that open up their research facilities to share with me what their technology initiatives were and what they're trying to develop. And some of the ones that I really want to thank are Petrobras, Shell, Swamber J, and Vista Oil and Gas for allowing me that opportunity. Because I work for a competing company and a lot of times I don't necessarily get to see that. And also going to Saudi Arabia and talking with our members and especially the women members in Saudi Arabia. That was a highlight for me that I definitely want to go back and return and spend more time into that beautiful country that my company does not operate there. So I wouldn't have given that chance. And again, it's just talking with the members, hearing everybody's perspective. You really now are a lot better informed and educated when you understand or hear what people's challenges or issues are from a worldwide perspective. Say, for example, Gulf Coast sections, they've got some initiatives that they would like to take on a global scale because they think it would really impact our members. But, you know, having understood what works where, you know, it's like, well, that here are some areas where possibly that could expand. But it's really not applicable because it's not an issue in, say, for example, these other areas. So, yeah, it was very, very unfortunate. I'm a much richer person, not in terms of finances, but in terms of wonderful memories and photos and new friendships that are going to be with me for many, many years to come. This is about the part of the podcast where I usually start going through wrapping up the episode, giving out the thanks, talking about question of the month. We're not going to be doing question of the month for this podcast. We do want to keep the conversation going, though, so feel free to use hashtag S.P.E. podcast to reach us on social. But, Shauna, because this is your last podcast for the presidential column, hopefully we can get you to come back and do some other podcasts on other topics in the future. I'd like to leave you with any final thoughts that you have to conclude this episode. Thank you, Jason. I appreciate this because there's a few final points and thoughts that I do want to get out to our membership and just reiterate the fact that S.P.E. is a member driven organization. And during my time as president, it was very important throughout my travels that members' voices be heard, well, not even through my travels, but even as we were parked in our homes, social distancing. I did not want to just take over the social media streams and have our members only hearing the one voice. You don't have to be S.P.E. president, a committee chair, an officer to implement change in order to increase your membership's value. Twenty years ago, when I was a younger member and again, as an artificial specialist, a lot of the industry's artificial lip knowledge was shared at. Non S.P.E. events, and I made it my mission as a young member to change that. And it started by talking with S.P.E. staff and offering to lead a small local workshop and just keep champion and building on that. And now it's evolved into a global artificial of conference series. And I'm proud I can look into one petro and see so much more artificial lip content and also events that are occurring within S.P.E. And it just started out as myself as a young member, not just speaking out, but actually stepping up to be a champion. You know, I'm so proud to be part of a society with so many strong leaders and contributors and champions within its ranks. And as I traveled the globe to engage with the membership, my pride in being a petroleum engineer and professional in this oil and gas industry grew with each visit. And I want to thank all the sections and chapters that hosted me. And I pledge to keep my promise to meet those sections where visits were canceled due to the pandemic. I want to thank our S.P.E. staff from all our regional offices for their constant efforts to implement and maintain the programs and create the tools identified S.P.E. strategic plan. I need to express my gratitude to my employer, Oxidinal Petroleum, for their steadfast support and understanding throughout my journey as S.P.E. president because basically they cut me loose. They had to cut me loose for three years and financially support me during my presidency. And you know, it's one thing for an individual to see the value that S.P.E. provides in terms of competency development, but it's even better to work for a company that recognizes it as well. And that is definitely my employer, Oxidinal Petroleum. So, you know, as I've worked to make our society stronger and not just as S.P.E. president, but right from day one as being an S.P.E. member, you know, I too have gained strength from this memorable experience. So with that, I'm Shawna Noonan, S.P.E. 2020 president. Thanks for listening."
SPE Live Podcast: Interoperability as a Key Factor to Better Drilling Automation,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the May 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future, the importance of supporting academia and students in navigating the challenges and opportunities in the industry. And now your moderator, Jennifer Miskimmons. Hello, I am Jennifer Miskimmons, department head of petroleum engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, and I am pleased to join 2024 President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast episode. This month, Terry and I will focus on the academic side of things, what the future holds for petroleum engineering and the importance of supporting our university and students. Thanks Terry for the invitation to join you. Well, Jennifer, thank you. I know you have a very busy schedule running a department. And so I appreciate you taking the time. As I was kind of thinking through really how we would do this and really talking a little bit more about the student aspect, I thought, you know, who would be a great host? And certainly you came to mind. I mean, you've been running the department now for a while and you've been at Colorado School of Mines even longer. So you understand the academic side. You've worked in industry, but then you've also been on the SP board. So I think you kind of understand both sides of this better than I do for sure. So thank you for joining. It's going to be hopefully a great episode. So you know, the intention, as you kind of alluded to, was to really kind of follow up on last month. So last month, we talked about energy education, kind of the energy for me, things like that. And as we got into talking about that, it kind of led to the importance of our public image and public perception and really educating the public. And then, of course, that led to the whole discussion about how do we attract the next generation? And the impact our image has on the next generation. So it just seemed like a natural fit to go ahead and start, you know, take this month and maybe just look at our petroleum engineering departments, the status. A lot of people ask me questions about that and talk a little bit more about students, you know, why they're so important to us and important to SPE and to our future. But I do want to say, you know, this, the importance of remembering that attracting the next generation has to be a collaborative effort, not just between universities as well as SPE and SPE members as well. So again, thank you. Well, no, I appreciate it. I appreciate the opportunity to to talk with you about this. I know why this is such an important topic, but I'd be very curious to see why you think this is such an important topic yourself and SPE. Well, let's start with the board of directors. You know, we we understand the importance of our universities, of our students, of our faculty, you know, and the importance of they are to our industry. They're important, obviously, to SPE. And, you know, they're important to the extent that, you know, they are a part of our strategic plan that we just put together. I mean, in that plan, we specifically call out academia and universities in two places. One is in, you know, we have what we call our core constituencies. So the members are our member companies, our sponsors, our external stakeholders. But the fifth or fourth in the list is our our universities and our students. And then, of course, if you kind of looked at the landscape, the environment, our members listed kind of we had the top five concerns. And one of those concerns is attracting the next generation. So it's clearly important to SPE. But more important, you know, if you've listened to my podcast, you've heard me say over and over again, but I think, you know, if we really want to solve the energy trilemma or the energy challenge, I like to call it of providing accessible and affordable and reliable, secure and green and decarbonized energy. The only way we're going to do this while we're the best suited to do it as an industry, the only way we can do it is if we have the best and the brightest in our industry and coming to our industry. You know, we're going to need the best and the brightest coming to help us solve these complex problems. You know, we need the next technical breakthrough. And, you know, most of the stuff is yet to be discovered. So it's either going to come from our younger professionals in our industry already or the students that are about to enter. And of course, our companies ask and need the pipeline to be full as well. So they, you know, they're out hiring and they need the next generation. And so that's going to help them build the future. And, you know, I don't want to be overly dramatic here, but, you know, frankly, I think humanity and the planet needs us and needs us to keep doing what we're doing about decarbonizing and supplying the fuels that fuel our future. And students are at the center of that. So, you know, one thing I do kind of say this every once in a while, but going out and talking to students is the most fun thing I get to do. But, you know, when you think about their concerns, I mean, number one concern, of course, is they want a long term career, but they also want to make a difference. They want to feel like they're making a difference in the world. And so, I mean, I think we can do that. And so that's why I think it's such an important topic that we discussed today. That's what I frequently hear from students also is, yes, they obviously want a long term career, but making a difference is very important and they definitely can do so. So hopefully we can get some more students come in our direction in some of these areas. So what is the current state of petroleum engineering programs? Well, you know, Lloyd Hindsie, who's retired Texas Tech, who, by the way, I had as a professor when I was in university, but he doesn't like me to tell people that. But at any rate, he does a study. He's you know, he's done this enrollment survey each year. Honestly, I don't know how long he's been doing, but I know his data goes back to 1970. And so, you know, it's primarily geared to the U.S., but he does have a handful of international schools in that list. And, you know, what he shows kind of confirms what we always have known. And that is, you know, our enrollment typically lags. What's going on in the industry about four or five years makes sense. But, you know, we were we were growing really well as departments until 2015, 16. You know, of course, the industry had a downturn in 1415 that impacted enrollment. Saw significant drop. I think that we probably were about to bottom out and then COVID happened. So that didn't help anything either. And so but the good news is, at least it appears in from his survey that we have bottomed out and maybe even begun to have modest increases. If you look at this year versus last year, the undergraduate enrollment in the U.S., at least the universities that responded is up on average. Freshman classes are up 15 to 20 percent. So that's, of course, encouraging. Again, these are averages. Half the schools are up. The other half are flat or maybe slightly down. So, you know, it's not it's it does depend a little bit on what region you're in. What's interesting is about half of those schools are actually up two years in a row. So I think that's that's a nice trend. I think you're in charge, you know, you've met with the department heads recently. And one of the things that I think they the sense was that we've seen the bottom and generally probably increasing or, you know, guarded optimism there probably. But I just want to point out that it does depend a little bit on where you're located. I mean, it's not all schools are up. Not all schools are enjoying that. But the jobs are out there. So, you know, that always helps, of course, as you know. And then I guess kind of along those lines, I know this is not the petroleum engineering program programs, but I think it's maybe indicative of kind of this same idea that maybe we bottomed or starting to increase. And that is, you know, this we just completed a kind of our membership review for SPE in 2023. And student membership is up 15 or 13 percent. So that's a big increase for us. In fact, it's even bigger when you're in the middle of the year. So we're up on average. The nice thing is that all regions, except for Latin America, Caribbean and Russia, are up double digit. So this isn't just one region story. Some are up more than others. Even Europe is up like 27 percent. So that's encouraging. Latin America, Caribbean is flat. So, you know, we didn't drop there. Russia did drop, but I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. So, you know, we didn't drop there. Russia did drop, but I think we understand why there. So I think state of the programs does depend on what region you're in. But generally speaking, I think as a whole, we are on the upswing. Is it dramatic? Is it fast? I don't know. I think that remains to be seen. That's amazing. Overall, that we're up that 13 percent. And like you said, it's very region, region dependent. But the folks that I'm talking to, I think you I think you use the right words. Guarded optimism that maybe we've bottomed out. We are starting to see those increases overall. Speaking of what are the challenges to getting more students in the petroleum engineering and related subjects that can help out with some of the industry needs here? Yeah, you know, I think, you know, it's typically public image, you know, maybe just kind of what the perception is of our industry and some of the things. I'd say there's probably top three. One is, look, this energy transition narrative doesn't help us. I mean, transition implies we're going away, changing, whatever. I mean, I don't like to use transition. I mean, I think evolution is a much better word. Some people even say it's energy expansion, but that doesn't help us. You know, we also have to deal with, you know, our image of our industry has been the cyclical nature and we have layoffs every once in a while. And, you know, it doesn't help us any. I mean, I hope I always hope that's behind us. I do feel better about the way things are. I think that companies have shown restraint and I think we understand that. You know, I don't know how much of an impact this has, but it does make me always wonder, you know, this this image we've had 10 or 15 years ago of of the West Texas roustabout with a hard hat and a pipe wrench over his shoulder and oil on his face and all this stuff. I mean, I don't think that helps anything. But, you know, if you look at some of the NLCs or excuse me, the IOCs now, some of their advertising, I mean, much better. I mean, you see people working, you know, high tech things. I mean, think about what we do when we drill a well in the Gulf of Mexico. Nine thousand feet of water. I mean, we're putting a man on the moon is what we're doing. And so I think we're getting better at that part of it. So I think image is part of it. And along those lines, of course, students are always concerned about, do we have a long term career? We just talked about it a second ago. And, you know, they're led to believe on a lot of fronts that petroleum won't be relevant in a few years. Clearly, that's not the case. So that's an issue. I think the other concern we probably challenge, it's out there. And this isn't the case everywhere. But but, you know, just the amount of students coming into college now is down. I mean, in the US, student enrollment is down. I mean, it's just it's just the numbers game. It's just a birthright game. And then, of course, you add into there the STEM education. That doesn't help. I mean, STEM education is enrollment is down. A lot of a lot of kids are not wanting to go into that. And then, you know, just even Earth oriented sciences are down in K through 12. So, you know, they're what students want to go into, you know, computer science, things like that. And those are it's all important. I mean, don't get me wrong. But I think that, you know, that kind of probably sums up, you know, some of it is image related. But then the other part of it is just, you know, just demographics are changing. Yeah, I agree. That's really what we're seeing also is the demographics are changing. But we do kind of have some of those older images that stick with people and getting folks to understand that there is there's a lot of interesting, incredibly technology driven challenges that we're dealing with, that the students of the future and engineers of the future are going to be able to help us with. And we need that right. We need that. We need that new blood coming into the industry to help and drive some of those and answer some of those challenges. Which speaking of which, how do you think universities are addressing these different challenges that we're speaking of? Well, you would probably know better than I, but I'll tell you what I've kind of heard. You know, first of all, it does depend on where you're at. I will say that I think most departments are kind of dealing with this and certainly has to, you know, together. But I mean, they have to deal with it in their own university, their own region. You know, some petroleum engineering departments have certainly merged with other departments, maybe G&G side of things, or maybe they've changed their names to something geoscience related or even subsurface engineering. You know, unfortunately, there have been some programs that have closed. It's not I'm not glad that's happened, but it has happened. But I would say I think that what I heard, you know, is that, you know, I think your petroleum heads meeting last year, you know, kind of talked about, you know, kind of the what everyone was doing, and I think that the majority of schools believe that petroleum engineering is here to stay and they're keeping the name and in some fashion. But instead, they're adding to electives, offering electives on, you know, maybe it's on carbon capture or hydrogen or energy related things, or in many cases, I think what universities are doing is they're incorporating some of this into the existing class. So as an example, your drilling class, you might talk about drilling a geothermal well, or in your reservoir class, you might talk about storage and things like that. So I think that's mostly what at least let's say that they're the way they're handling their departments. And then, you know, I mean, I think a lot of cases are going out into high schools or even earlier and talking about the importance of energy and then, of course, petroleum and oil and gas industry. And, you know, I just want to take this opportunity to just point out that, again, you don't have to be a petroleum engineer to be an SP member. I mean, in fact, over half of our members are not degree petroleum engineers. They work in our industry and join. So I think that that's kind of some of the tactic that the schools are taking as well. Yeah, I agree. That's when I talk with people, that's kind of what I see also is one size doesn't fit all in each school and each program is having to take a look at their particular situation. But there are many, many different routes that people are going to address some of these challenges. So how can SP members help with some of this? Well, I mean, the first thing is just to remember the importance of giving back. You know, I don't think you can ever underestimate the impact of what students think and see when when they see alumni or they see professionals come back and talk to them. You know, students, they like to hear about their career paths. They want to hear, you know, about how you want to know how your career unfolded. I mean, it's an unknown to them at this point in time. They want to see what opportunities are out there. You know, they want to see how they can make an impact. They especially want to hear this from younger members, by the way, young professionals, you know, as much as they can probably try to relate to me. I think it's a lot easier for them to relate to somebody who's in their 20s and early 30s. But, you know, that's one aspect. You know, I think we have to always remember that universities do need financial involvement from industry, whether it's companies. So, you know, if your company has a problem or something, they need researched or worked on. I think you should always be thinking about the universities to help support graduate programs and the projects and funding there. Of course, scholarships, you know, this is one of the things our sections, our professional sections do very well. I think two years ago, they gave out a million dollars across from what we could tell in scholarships. And so there's always that opportunity. So supporting your local section will help support scholarships. The other thing is it will talk about it probably a little bit on how to start a section. But, you know, each section, excuse me, chapter, but each chapter is affiliated with a section. So if you can, if your section supports a student chapter, then you have the ability to support them there. You know, always looking for speakers. So if you can give go back and give us speaking engagement. Some schools have mentorship programs. There's probably opportunities there. Most schools have an industry advisory board. Usually it's made up of alumni, but then have to be from industry. And it kind of helps, you know, link up the chapters with with industry experts, but also, you know, provide curriculum advice and things like that. And then, of course, you know, if if your university doesn't have an SP chapter, you can always offer to go back and just speak to them about the industry or something like that. Although we do have 400 chapters, so there's if your university doesn't have one, it's pretty unique at this point. So, well, as somebody that's been on the receiving end of many of those opportunities, I would I would second to reach out to your alma mater and see if there are things that you can help, because it's amazing how just those little things can help out a university, you can help out a school, can help out the students, see what those potentials might be in the future. So say there is a school out there or university or program that wants to start a new student chapter. What does it take? How do they go about doing so? Well, as we mentioned before, I do want to point out that you don't have to have a petroleum engineering degree department in order to have an SP student chapter. I mean, again, we have 400 student chapters. We don't have 400 petroleum engineering programs in the world. So clearly, you don't have to have that. Some some programs just have a graduate program in petroleum engineering. You know, I'll just give you some numbers. You know, there's I think there's about 25 universities that have a petroleum engineering undergrad or grad program or have something embedded in another degree. But we have 40 student chapters in the US. So clearly, we have some places that don't have that. Oklahoma State, you know, they have a petroleum engineering minor, then they have a petroleum engineering master's and a PhD. And USC has a chem. with petroleum engineering minor subsurface emphasis. So we have different opportunities here. As far as what you need, you need a minimum of 25 students, similar to a section. You need at least a two year program in a related energy industry. So so you do need that. Two of the key aspects, so once you have that is you need a faculty advisor. The faculty advisor needs to be an SP member. Faculty advisors are really critical. The stronger the faculty advisor, the better chance you have of that chapter continuing, particularly if you don't have petroleum engineering department at your school, because they're going to be the ones that provide the continuity and, you know, provide the impetus and the, you know, the, you know, kind of keep the students going because students come and go. But, you know, hopefully the faculty advisor can be constant. And then the other one that's important is you do have to have a sponsoring SP section. I kind of mentioned it before, but, you know, the SP section, that professional section that sponsored you is really important because they're going to provide support and guidance to the section. You know, hopefully they'll do things like, you know, provide scholarship opportunities or things like that. But just keep in mind that they don't have to be the chapter. Student chapter doesn't have to be in the same city or country, even a region as the. I mean, region helps, but as the chapter. So I'll just give you some examples. The Denver section, they sponsored the University of Wyoming. They sponsor your school, the Colorado School of Mines and Montana Tech region. They're in the region, but not in the same state or city. Oklahoma City section, they support OU, of course, but they also support Missouri S&T. So it's really important. Those, you know, that's kind of ends up being kind of the link for those students to professionals. So the strength of a student chapter is usually geared to the faculty advisor and the student section. So it's really important. There's there's more guidelines, but those are the main ones. You can go to SP.org to find out more. Now, that sounds great. That's good to good to know for those that might be considering such out there. So I get asked this question a lot, and I'll be very curious to see your answer to it. But so why should students get involved at the university level? I get students that ask me that all the time. What do you tell students why they should get involved? Well, the first thing I tell them is don't do what I did. So, look, I mean, I I joined SBE as a college student. I did it for one reason, and that was for my resume. And do that. I think that's important. But then do more than what I did. I just kind of I got it on my resume and that's about all I did. But I think it's important because in addition, in addition to having that on your resume, then you also if you're is getting involved, getting involved. You get to learn how to work together with your your your fellow students, you know, for a common goal. You get to see your sense of accomplishment. You know, when you're interviewing for a job, they're going to ask you about, OK, what does this membership mean? What does that do? And you need to be able to say more than, well, I signed up to get on my resume like I did. But, you know, you can tell them about how you ran this particular event or or what have you. You know, it also helps just obtain a, you know, kind of a better understanding of our profession, because, you know, I think most of student chapters do a really good job of bringing in industry speakers. And so you get to meet those speakers. You know, a lot of times they're they're high level BPs, CEOs of presidents of companies. And, you know, you get to learn how to network. And frankly, as we all know, in the professional side, networking is a huge aspect of what you need to do to to basically make it in the world. Your network is very important and you can start at a very early age to do that. And I just want to point out membership is free. You may have I don't know some some have local dues, but internationally it is a free aspect. SP doesn't charge for student members because of the, you know, some gracious donations and sponsorship by Chevron. But, you know, I think it's important to get involved when you're in school, to do more than just study and more than get good grades, to be able to show that you you have the ability to to be more well rounded. I'm I'm laughing as I'm listening because I think you and I joined our sections as students for possibly some of the same reasons. But hindsight being twenty twenty, it's amazing what you look back and see how much joining the student chapter really did help your career over time and what it brought to us as professionals over time. So, yeah, that's a well, the funny, the funny thing is, Jennifer, I mean, I have to tell you, when I meet people on the board or, you know, people who have I'll call them advancing in SP 95 percent of I'm sure you see it 95 percent of them more leaders in in their student chapters. I mean, it's it's a great foundation for them. And so I think it's really important. Yeah, I agree. A hundred and ten percent on that one and what it brings to them as students. And like you said, being able to meet some of the people that they meet through SP is is pretty amazing. It definitely is. So that helps benefit the students. What about benefits to the professionals? Well, you know, obviously, the purpose of these podcasts have been to try to help people understand how to get the most out of the membership. And so as professionals, I think the first maybe the most obvious one is by by investing in students and the universities. You know, these are the these are the places where you're going to be recruiting. This is where your next employees are going to come from. And so I think the more you invest in them, the better product you're going to get and the better thing you're better, you're going to have for your your companies. You know, having healthy student chapters keeps the pipeline full. And and then, of course, it helps get students interested in your company. And, you know, kind of gets them connected early on to the industry. So I think that's good. I think that, you know, going back to university, if you've never done it, whether it's your alma mater or not, is is really pretty fulfilling and a lot of fun. You just I think would be amazed at the impact that you can have and how that makes you feel. I will say I do think as professionals, this is we kind of mentioned before, this is really important for YPs. I think it's twofold for YPs. One one is, of course, it helps the students because they get to relate to somebody. But for you personally, I mean, if you're giving presentations to students or you're interacting with students, doing Q&A with them, that's a pretty good leaping off point for you to develop your presentation skills. And you're in really in a non-threatening area. You're not an ATCE in front of the stimulation crowd, right? You're in front of students that are happy to see you. And so it really it helps you hone some of your soft skills. You know, again, I think it does give you a sense of professional fulfillment. I mean, maybe not everybody, but I think you would be probably surprised at the impact you can have on a student's career, just even with some brief interaction. I'm sure you've had it, Jennifer. I mean, even at ATC and stuff, the students come up to you and and I've had people come up to me after they become SP members and say, I remember when you spoke to us. And so it's just I just I just think it it is part of our giving back side of things. And it does have benefits for us, but I think that's the important thing. You know, we can probably all remember some professor or some professional member or somebody that kind of made an impact on you. And you may not even realize you made the impact. So, you know, look, in the end, ultimately. By supporting our students in universities, we expand our network. We gain professional fulfillment. But more importantly, look, it's all part of creating our energy future. I mean, it ensures longevity of our industry. That in turn lifts the world out of energy poverty. And, you know, I don't think anything's more important than creating our industry's energy future than interacting and supporting our young members. So I think it's I think that's the main the main thing. I think you hit on it. I think we all can think back to that one person that probably never knew what an impact they had on us, but we remember seeing them at some point. And the tables can be turned. People can now become that person that somebody is going to remember down the road that really inspired them. And that's an important thing. It's an important thing to give back like that. Well, Terry, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you on this. Obviously, it's a topic near and dear to my heart. So what do you have on tap for June? Well, well, thank you, first of all, for joining me, Jennifer. But also thanks for all you do for students. I mean, I know you're invested invested in them. And I think I know I know a lot of people appreciate a lot of students. Thank the world of you. And I think for good reason. So thank you for the passion that you have for everything you do and for what you do for S.P.E. But next up, I think in June, we're going to talk about maybe dive a little bit more into soft skills. You know, I've kind of alluded to it a little bit today. We've talked about it in the past, but maybe talk about soft skills, the importance of soft skills, probably talk a little bit more about volunteering, S.P.E. volunteering, kind of how that helps you and helps you ultimately create your energy future. So I think that's we're going to talk about. And I look forward to speaking with everybody next month. Thanks again, Jennifer. Thank you. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the S.P.E. President's Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
"SPE Live Podcast: Market Outlook ‚Äì Oil Prices for 2023, US Natural Gas Market, and More","This is the SPE Live podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, interoperability is a key factor to better drilling automation. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on January 11th, 2023. And now your moderator, Deep Joshi. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the SPE Live on interoperability as a key factor to better drilling automation. My name is Deep Joshi. I'm a data scientist at Quantum Energy Partners. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. Drilling operations involve many different service providers, each addressing specific assets of the well construction process. In practice, the drilling in the drilling organization, including the support from onshore operations centers, addresses the coordination of various tasks executed by multiple entities. The natural fragmentation of drilling operation into multiple services has slowed down the implementation of drilling automation solutions because computer systems from each individual party are traditionally not designed to exchange information with the other systems. The SPE drilling system automation technical section has therefore started an initiative to define standards for computer interoperability during the drilling process. This subcommittee called D-VIS stands for Drilling and Well Center Operability Standards. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Eric Caillou is a chief scientist for Drilling and Well Modeling Group at the Norwegian Research Center. He works with multidisciplinary solutions for well planning, real-time diagnostic of drilling operations, drilling automation, mathematical modeling of drilling processes and sensors. Caillou holds an MS degree in civil engineering from Lyon, France, an MS degree in software engineering from the University of Nice, France and a PhD in petroleum engineering from the University of Stavanger, Norway. Caillou received the SPE International Drilling Engineering Award in 2022. Eric, welcome to the SPE Life. Thank you very much for this nice introduction. Eric, what are some of the common challenges associated with drilling operations? Well, there are actually many different challenges associated with the automation of the drilling operations. And one of the most important background problem is the fact that the drilling operation is involving many different companies and each of those companies are representing different disciplines. So the setup of the companies during the drilling operation changes as the well construction process evolves. So, for example, you don't have the same companies when you are drilling, when you are running the casing and cementing and so forth. So basically we have a constellation of different companies which is changing and this makes the drilling process automation quite complex because of the changes that you have around that. So each of those companies which are involved into the drilling process are not really used to exchange information and the coordination between the different companies is mostly done by the drilling organization itself. So it's more like human centered. So the existing system which exists for exchanging information are often proprietary and they are targeted with specific implementation. And because of that, it's quite difficult to scale every single automation applications across the industry because you have to change up the different companies that you have in the different drilling operations. So we need also to recognize that the drilling contractor has a very central position in the drilling operation since the driller is one who is operating the drilling machines and it has of course the responsibility of the drilling operation in practice. The driller is using the drilling control system and the drilling control system is mostly focused on the drilling machine and not really on the drilling process. So it's quite important when we are trying to automate the drilling process that we inform the driller as much as we can about the current situation so that we help actually the driller understanding what is happening when we are running automation functions. And this is an important concept around human in the loop for automation. So we need to respect the notions of separation of concerns and make sure that the drilling contractor is the central piece of the puzzle for automation and the implementation because they are infinite, the ones who are responsible for running the drilling machines. So you mentioned drilling processes and drilling machines both. How is controlling a drilling process different than just controlling with drilling machines? Yes, so if we look at the drilling control system which exists nowadays on modern rigs, they are focused on controlling the drilling machines and making sure that we will have a safe operation of the machines. So what does that mean? That means that actually embedded into the drilling control system, so we have some mechanisms for detecting faults and reacting to those faults. An example of this would be for example machine anti-collision and you have also implementation of safe operating envelopes like for example making sure that you will not exceed the operating envelope making sure that you will not exceed the amount of power which is available for driving each of those machines. But everything is focused on the machine. Now the drilling process is very different because it's envelopes of course the drilling machine but it also envelopes also everything which is down the hole. And what is down the hole or the drilling system completely is actually a very complex entity. It's really important to understand that actually a tree string and a well borer is extremely slender and because of this slenderness that we are talking so we have very small diameters compared to the lengths that's what this slenderness means. We have a lot of elasticity and compressibility of the system both in terms of the string and the fluids and that means that when we keep a command on the machine so there is very long reaction times. Now the drillers they we've experienced they get the gut feeling about these delays and limits that they need to work with and it's no only nowadays that actually we are capable of having a computer system which can integrate in real time this type of estimation of the limits and thresholds so that you can avoid drilling incidents and optimize the drilling process. So the problem with these calculations or the computations that needs to be done is that they depend on many different sources of information and these sources of information are spread amongst all those participants that I mentioned in the previous question and therefore there is a problem that the DCS if it needs to implement automation need to understand or to utilize the fact that we have a drilling process and not only the drilling machine and at the same time it is not necessarily having access to all the information which is necessary for calculating those limits and thresholds and optimization for the training procedures for the operational procedures. So it's important that actually that this training control system can exploit information which is made available elsewhere and that's why some of those training control systems are accepting actually advice from external agents. So that's a new offer which has been available for a few years now that the training control system vendors started to provide the ability for external agents or algorithms or routines to configure their own functionality from external information. So with this being said so it's this new type of training control system are now classified as automatic training control system or ADCS and the advantage of this new functionality is that experience at that more novice drillers can benefit of functionalities which assist them during the training process and render the process more safe and more efficient. Probably doesn't compete with the best experienced drillers but it may be an assistance for more novice or standard drillers. What are some of the difficulties associated with the external agents communicating with the DCS? Yeah so that's a big problem because actually every ADCS vendor has implemented its own way for being interfaced so that makes it very difficult actually to external agents or provider of external agents to interface with the different ADCS. You need to reconnect for each of those different solutions for interfacing and then when you go to the rig site so every rig is different even if you have a fleet of the same rigs or small nuances between each of those rigs and you need to do a lot of work for adapting your external agent solution for each of those different ADCS vendors, rig configurations and even during the operation so the constellation of different actors may change and then you need to reconfigure everything so it's a lot of work. So much time is used in trying to adapt all these functionalities for the different contexts and that slows down statistically the adoption of training automation across the industry because that has a direct impact on the cost for implementing automation. If you think about each installation of an external agent at the rig site you will need to go through a factory acceptance test, a site acceptance test and a lot of many months of engineering ahead of that to provide a solution. So there is therefore this idea that was born about four or five years ago that actually there was an industry standard for interoperability at the rig site then we could have a kind of middleware which is placed between those external agents and the ADCS which would render this communication as seamless as possible and therefore reduce the cost for installation of automation functions. Now what is important is when we build this middleware for the interoperability it should not be based on a kind of common denominator for the functionalities which exist on all ADCS because then that would be very limited. On the contrary it needs to be very flexible and to accommodate for many solutions which doesn't exist yet, needs to think about the future and this is what one of the challenges that we have actually when we are trying to define an interoperability layer is to make sure that we can both accommodate with the present but also be reliable for the future as well and the reason is that if we don't account for this future evolution the standard will be always out of date and there is a risk that it would not be adopted because it would be delayed compared to the current functionalities which are made available in the industry. So and the last thing is that an interoperability architecture should be able to accommodate for the multitude of different service providers that exist out there and be able to sort out orchestrations so that you have if you have multiple external agents you can sort out which functions need to be prioritized and how conflicts are resolved. Yes so you mentioned the interoperability between DCAs and external agents what are some of the methods that are being investigated for achieving this interoperability objective? Yes so that's what the work we have been doing in the Davis organization is basically to use actively this notion of capability description so if you think about each ADCS it can describe in a computer readable format its capabilities and then external agents can read those capabilities and adapt to the existing capabilities. So if we achieve that that means that actually that you don't need to recode or to recertify your external agents all the time because then you have something which is very flexible. So the standard is about being able to describe these capabilities being able to provide management of conflict resolutions and prioritization and of course we also try to provide example that can make of those problem capabilities description so that actually the life of implementers of external agents is as simple as possible. Now need to realize also that most ADCS and that goes back to the responsibility of the drink contractor about for the operation they have infinity the people who has the responsibility of the safety of the drink operation therefore the functionalities which exist at the level of the ADCS are usually hard coded and tested very seriously and the only thing that they allow are to be configured for some parameters by those external agents and this is part of those very standard capabilities which can exist. Now some most advanced more advanced ADCS can provide even better functionalities like for example the possibility to schedule new task on the fly and that is quite nice because that means that actually that you can have relatively flexible ways of implementing automation with this type of flexibility but even if we have that so if new tasks are pushed on the ADCS system so we need to make sure that the end user the trader is capable of understanding what is happening and for that we need to push those tasks with a lot of context so that actually the trader can both accept and or reject the new tasks which are being pushed on the automation system. So the design of the architecture that we are putting together is really centered around this principle of separation of concern so we have a hierarchical control and we need actually to make sure that there are each of the layers in this hierarchical control and are not interfering with each others so that actually we don't create jamming situations between the different automation functions with their respective layers in the hierarchical control. In addition to that so we have a kind of cement for all these functionalities which is exchange of signals at the reset which is based on a semantic description of each of the signals which is computer interpretable and therefore making sure that any parties can read and understand the signals which are made available and therefore you don't need to have a manual work for connecting to every signals which are made available at the exit all the time and that facilitates a lot actually the implementation for trading automation. How is this D-Vis's work on interoperability organized? Yeah so it's a cross-industry corporation which is a subcommittee of SPEDSATs, the Trading System Automation Technical Section and it's a very nice setup. There are plenty of different companies who are participating to the effort. It's really active, and many meetings every week and a lot of participants who are really spending a lot of time helping getting this interoperability working together. So one of the things we discovered at the start was actually every of us working in this Davis organization or Davis subcommittee had different backgrounds and actually it was not easy to communicate with each other because maybe some words had different meanings depending on the backgrounds that we had. So we spent some time to try to define a common glossary of concepts and put that together so that actually when we talk about the concept then everybody can agree that it is referring to this definition. All these definitions and FIS' art are put together into some web pages that you can find on a website which is called d-vis.org so anyone who is listening to this session is encouraged to visit this site. You will find a lot of information there. Otherwise the subcommittee is organized with four different work streams while working on different aspects of the problem of interoperability. So one work stream is called Dream Process Protection and addresses the problems of how to interpret with full detection isolation recovery functionalities with safe operating envelope functionalities with feedback controllers with standard procedures. We have also another work stream working on the ADCS interface which is proposing an interface to the automated training control system technology layer of the drilling rig. We have a third work stream which is working on the reference architecture and which is especially working on the prioritization of different requests and the orchestration of the different advice. And we have a fourth work stream which is working on exchanging training data through a hub where the meaning of the signals is described using a method called semantic tech work and which means that actually the computer systems can interpret the meaning of the information which is exchanged. So right now we are focusing on preparing some demonstrations on how all these pieces are working together. We start with the simplest one we could thought about and that's how we can have a ROP optimization system working with many different types of scenarios for the ADCS and then we will go to more and more complex situations or scenarios like for example a generic down linking system to download tools and then simpler and complex pump startup procedures and so on and so forth. I really encourage everyone who is interested in that topic to join. You can do that by visiting this website d-vis.org and you can register and say that you are interested and you can if you want to join. So the more people the better it is for the community. Eric all the work you described from d-vis sounds really fascinating. So is the goal for this work to replace existing standards with XML or work alongside it? No it's really to work alongside. So with XML has its own purpose and it's very well developed. So we try to supplement the work with XML and we're really focused on this interoperability with the training control system or the ADCS with the automated training control system and that's really working alongside other standards and when standards are already existing so we use them. So for example OPC UA is one of the things that we are adopting for this as it's suitable way of exchanging information for other sites. What are some of the common roadblocks you've seen in implementing interoperability in this way? Well there are many roadblocks possible. The first thing is that if the standard is not adapted to the requirements of the end user that would not be adopted. So that really need to think about practicality so that it is useful. The other thing is that if the standard is always when you're behind what the industry is doing then it will not be adopted either. So we need to be really flexible when it was standard which means that when it is installed you can stay with it for many years without having to enhance or to make a new revision of the standard. So the longer the time between revisions the better it is for the standard to be a good standard. Now we'll take a couple of questions from LinkedIn. The first question is can you mention the communication between drilling machine control systems and the external applications? Can you please explain more about this? Yes so basically the ADCS or different ADCS may have different interfaces which are made available for external parties to communicate with them and usually in terms of parameters for functions which exist inside the ADCS. Now we put an additional layer in between which contains this capability description and which indicates where these parameters are made available and how to access them. So the external application or the external agent can read these capabilities and utilize this capabilities description to find what it should send and how to send it actually to the ADCS and there is a two-way communication so the ADCS also can communicate some feedback about when the function is turned on, when it's turned off, when it's ready and so on and so forth and this also is described as a capability description and the external agent can read this information and utilize that for the way it can communicate. We'll take another question from LinkedIn. How risky is the new automation system compared to conventional training systems? Yeah that can be risky of course but I would say that in many cases actually the training automation functionalities instead of increasing the risk or decreasing the risk so they can help actually detect situations and react upon those situations very quickly, much faster than a driller. So I will take an example from detections of for example pack-off or overpulls or over-torques and FISAD and so the automation system can really detect those things in just a fraction of a second or a few seconds and act upon that and we have seen in many cases actually that when this type of functionality are implemented at the rig side they do trigger quite a lot and most often actually much faster than what the trader could do. So they are really helpful not necessarily increasing the risk but assisting the driller. I think that's the key word and when I've been working with development of such functionalities and I've talked to the driller I tried to explain to them the point is not to replace them but actually to assist them and that was really important for them and they really take that as an important fact that this is fundamentally an assistance for them. Thanks a lot Eric. Thanks for the discussion and with that conclude this SPE live. Thank you. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast.

SPE Live Podcast: Technical Director Series: Drilling Operations and Progress within HSES. Can We Do Better?,"the This is SB talks Tech with Trent and Steve. All right. Everybody listening out there and podcast land. This is Trent and I'm joined with Steve were two editors with the Journal of Petroleum Technology. This is probably going to be one of the last podcast we do of the year. So you know, it's December. Anybody's reporter gets lazy and said, Hey, it's time to start the start those lists and talk about what we did this year. Hey, don't blame it on me. Sources stop answering phone calls around this time of year too. So right. And you know, it's a new podcast, so nobody's heard of us talk about these stories. So why why miss these opportunities? All right, let's get into it. Yeah, absolutely. Start off. Why don't you? So our last podcast, we also did a list. So just in case anybody thinks we're like losing original or we're not coming up with original ideas here. This this list is actually made by the people who read JPT. So we were going to do a quick review of the top 10 most read stories on JPT's website for the year of 2019. I don't know about you, Steve, but I kind of like the cross section. I thought I saw a couple of themes here. One was sort of a lot of interest in the challenges that the U. S shale sectors facing and then a lot of interest sort of on the digital side. Those were sort of my high level takeaway. Absolutely. In both in both of those, but I think that both of those point to I think another third thing, which is a lot of these point to how the job of engineers, demand for engineering is changing over time that people realize this is personal. Okay, well, we're going to just run down this list real quick kind of tease out the topic and talk about the things that we liked from these stories or the things that were interesting to us. And we're going to put a link to these on the show notes so that you can go read them in case you missed them. But number 10 starting off number 10. Shell E. O. R. delivers. So why won't the sector go big? Well, that's your story, Trent. So why don't you kind of tell them what you learned? Yeah. So this is our latest update. Our 2019 deep dive into the topic of shell E. O. R., which mostly refers to Huff and Puff gas injections, mostly in the Eagleford shale. We're starting to see some experiments in the Permian. There's been a lot of work over the years in the Bakken that I would not say has gone well. And so the examples that we have seen that have worked mostly come from, you know, E. O. G. One company in the entire spectrum of shell production. And we kind of explained why there's bottlenecks there by virtue of this topic being or this story being number 10 on the list. It shows that there's a lot of interest in here, not a lot of activity and the problems come down to uncertainty over how the process works and just trouble getting all of the pieces together. Mainly the giant gas compressors that you need to do it. I mean, I talked to one engineer late in the year on another story, and he just shifted to D. O. R. And I said, Well, does it work? And I said, Well, you know, the gas goes in more oil comes out. But the question is, can you do it economically? And the answer so far is nobody knows. And I think that's what's really stymieing the industry on this one. Yeah, I just saw a really great presentation by somebody who was working with the E. O. R. Team for E. P. Energy, which has been closely trying to follow E. O. G.'s success in the Eagle Ford, and it was clear to hear from the presentation. They actually ran into a lot of unexpected challenges. And one thing that I learned there was this issue of containment. Where does the gas go? Can we keep it in the area of the reservoir near these wells that we wanted to? That issue is actually not fully resolved. The advice was if you're going to do a shell you are project first pick an unbounded well that has no communication with other wells and see how long it takes to get the results out of that well. Then you can start to do some quicker economic forecasting. But the takeaway from E. P. Energy was it takes a long, long time to figure out if this works over a year, maybe a year and a half. And today's short cycle environment for shale, that's not really a big seller with the boardroom. I suppose also the other reality is that the big, intense fractures in really tightly spaced wells creates situations to make bounding, keeping the gas going where it's supposed to go really, really tough. Yeah, we've been told in this reporting, another reporting that if you had an area that suffered a lot of frac hits, a lot of long term communication, shale you are at least with Huff and puff is probably not going to be great. So yeah, there's a lot to unpack on that one. We're actually going to try to, I think in quarter one or Q2, circle back around and see if there's any other developments on the shale you are front. So what's next? Number nine, directional drilling becomes office work at Chevron and Hess. It was interesting where both Chevron and Hess had talked about bringing the directional drillers into control centers for the people of Chevron. It gave them the ability to exert a more consistent approach to how they do directional drilling, which was also the case for Hess. Hess talked about this in a story I'm working on for the next month's issue. And one of the things they said that is a big positive here is that by having two drillers following six wells at a time, they learn faster. So there's also just the element of these things fit into programs that help them continuously improve how they drill. And I think it kind of is a representation not only that more of the drillers are going to be in control centers and that more people are going to be in places and maybe controlling drilling from Houston in North Dakota, but also that they're going to be required to figure out not only how they drill that well, but how to drill the next well better. Yeah, consistency and then obviously overhead are both advantages here. You have your best directional driller working on six rigs all from the air conditioned comfort of downtown Houston building. But what's also interesting here, though, that is that it shows that there's like sort of a connection between the operational and the drilling side. So they're not just operating on the drilling side with the operators are actually taking over. You know what is a oil field service? Perhaps I'm not sure if those direct who those directional drillers work for. Yes, I guess theoretically they could be working for a directional drilling company at has or they could be directly employed by house. Well, another interesting thing is the way has does it. They stuck that person next to the person who is in charge of the drilling side. And then the two of them have to work out how to get there without creating a really, really jagged well path along the way. So what's next? That's right. Number eight. To solve frac hits, unconventional engineering must revolve around them. So this was another story that I wrote earlier in the year. This was basically my big summary from the hydraulic fracturing technology conference, the annual unconventional event in the space. I'm not sure if you remember the name of the S B E here. There was a call to action during the opening session, so there's probably 2000 people in the room. There's nowhere else to really be at this point in the conference. Few experts got up and gave very compelling presentations that basically outlined why and how this idea of fracture driven interference frack hits why it really is the defining issue of the day for for shale production and development. As well as the fact that it's really important to kind of come down to understanding not only when something shoots from one to the other and causes damage, but just really understanding what's going on in all those fractures in between wells. It's something that we talk about a lot, obviously, but it bears repeating this. This is the entire equation is shit is well spacing and well spacing translates straight into your well inventory. So figuring out how these wells work together as a system. That's going to be a big priority. And we know that in the past trying to diagnose these these interactions that was not a priority today. It's a major priority across the spectrum, so it doesn't really matter what size of a shale producer you are. You are probably more focused on watching frack hits and learning how they behave than you ever were before, and you'll be reporting on the kind of. Decline rates are showing up in part because of these things. Yeah Yeah, so separate from that, but I think we're following the you know that story for the foreseeable future. No question. And next is. Louisiana Austin Chalk hundreds of millions down the drain. So this was an area that's interesting. How to personal stories. I have friends who live in Baton Rouge area, and they have a bunch of land that they were looking every time I visited and they talk about how those Austin Chalk Exploration Wells are getting closer and closer land and they were looking forward the day of lease and all that drilling and then the story came out and it became apparent there's another story by the way by a massive Rossky. That he does a really complete job looking at the serious, serious problems they've had with the kind of water that they're coming getting into these wells. I mean, the amount of water production is such that they're just even though there was oil in there that. It was far, far too much water to actually make these things economic and. It doesn't mean that the whole field is going to go. The whole play is going to go away, but it definitely does seem like people are already starting to take some write offs, and there's real questions about whether they're going to have any appetite in this in this particular market to keep looking to see if there's this water is general or maybe specific to where they did their test wells. Yeah, it's really interesting because when we think about unconventionals in Louisiana, we tend to think about the Hainesville, but if you've been around for a little while, you remember the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale and then now you had Louisiana side of the Austin Chalk. So looking for tight oil in Louisiana, and I think that was one of the quotes that stuck out to me in that story was somebody who was sort of an observer was saying that the only people making money in that play are the saltwater disposal companies and that that was not the way it was supposed to go. Apparently not forever. And so what's next on the list? Number six number six slumbers a CEO outlines new vision for company. What do you think about this one, Steve? Well, I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. Well, first, sir, there's the bold moment where I attempt to pronounce a French name. Give it a shot. Okay, the new CEO, Olivier, they push talked to an investor conference and he made the point that the future of oil and gas is digital and their company is going to change because of that. Those capabilities are going to mean a lot more performance along the value chain, which means also that is an exit strategy of a sort for them because you also talked about that they're going to be resizing their company. They're going to be resizing the North American onshore operations, which is something that you talked about a few months ago, and I think we're going to be seeing more of and also by Halliburton as well recently of people pulling back from these operations, which haven't been making money in the U. S shale and focusing more on the growth that is internationally and offshore. Yeah, I mean, Schlumberger being the biggest service provider in the world, it's easy for a company like that to be able to pull back from the growth during a better period of the cycle. And then when that down cycle comes, you know, you're left holding the bag, and so that's a very bitter pill that we saw. Everybody had to swallow in 2015. And as we see sort of a the second slowdown of shale coming looks like Schlumberger wants to be much more involved with digital, which really just means they want to become more of a software company. They're talking about a doubling of that line of business within a relatively short period of time, but they're not going to be able to do that. So that's going to involve a culture change. I think I mean, one thing they mentioned is that they're they're actually going to be making some of the they're out there operating system that they use for a lot of this data analysis open source, which is really a break from the kind of proprietary focus that they've always had. It means you see if the industry as a whole will actually go that way and whether that sharing that you see a lot in the tech sector is going to show up in the market. The and so Halliburton and Schlumberger are obviously they're going that direction, and so that that arc is open source and and a lot more collaboration. So that was number 10 through six of the most read stories on JPT for 2019, but we got other publications here at the SBE. I'm going to toss it over the Jason to Taurus. He's going to give you the top five most read stories from some of our other publications. Thanks, Trent. So for the criteria of this list, we are looking at the top five most read stories from the following websites. Oil and gas facilities, which focuses on projects, systems, tech and news of facilities engineering, data science and digital engineering, SBE's newest publication presenting the evolving landscape of data management. The way ahead written by and for young professionals and HSE now covering stories affecting health, safety, environment, social responsibility, regulation and quality aspects of upstream oil and gas. Number five on this list, oil field flares provide a glaring reminder of the drive to produce more oil. This HSE now article by Steve breaks down data that shows natural gas flared in just two major U.S. shale plays exceeded the amount of gas consumed in both Columbia and Israel all of last year. At number four, transforming petroleum engineers into data science wizards. Found on DSDE, we learned there's no magic spell. Hard work and application are key in this tips and tricks article about data science and machine learning. Number three, technique FMC to create two independent publicly traded companies. The French engineering company is expected to complete this in the first half of 2020. The first spinoff company would be one of the largest E&C pure plays. The other would be a fully integrated technology and services provider. More on this story can be found on OGF. And at number two, Schells Van Bearden ranks number two in CEO world 2019 best CEOs list. This TWA article discusses what went into the rankings and spoiler, a total of four oil and gas company CEOs are ranked in the top 10 of this list. And the most read story this year from these websites comes from OGF, oil and gas facilities. And it is GE closes sale of Baker Hughes shares. A popular topic since GE bought Baker Hughes in 2017. This story continues to garner interest. The biggest takeaway, Baker Hughes is no longer a subsidiary of GE and is now rebranded back to Baker Hughes with a fresh new green logo. Trent? Great stuff, Jason. And reminder, all of these links are going to be on the show notes. So if you want to go read these stories and get caught up, you'll have your chance. All right. So Steve, we're back. We have five more headlines to read. We're just going to get right into it. Number five is the digital transformation at BP is starting to add up to billions. Number five. Right. Well, that's a story you did. So why don't you give us a, get this started on. Yeah. It's a wordy headline, but, you know, it deserved to be written that way, I think, just because a lot of people are wanting to see where is the money coming from all these digital investments. We talked a little bit about what Schlumberger was kind of trying to do with its new direction, but, but BP has been super aggressive on the digital front. They've been investing in dozens and dozens of startups. They've been, I think, fairly ambitious with some of the, with some of the projects that they're trying to do. But I mean, they're doing everything from, from robots to new seismic technology to cognitive learning, which is, or cognitive AI, which is sort of considered the, the highest order of artificial intelligence. And therefore it comes with like the most skepticism. But the digital transformation is, is, is, is, is, is, is happening. But they are saying that it's resulting in tens of thousands of extra barrels a day for the company and that they're eliminating cost and being able to move forward with a leaner workforce. And so, so they've, you know, they've been boasting about their success stories. I mean, yeah, their digital focus, I think began particularly in the, in the world of seismic. I mean, they have invested really heavily in advanced methods for, for analyzing and crunching all this data, which is the most, you know, data intensive thing the industry has ever done. And so they've, they've been really, really good at that stuff. I mean, they've not only found a lot of oil, but they found a lot of oil right near really big fat platforms, particularly the story reported on Thunder Horse. Yep. And that's cheap oil to add. And that's that in this marketing, you need tech to be cheap. It's funny you mentioned that because as we sit, you know, we're maybe two miles from BPS Houston offices where they have a giant, you know, supercomputer right on the side of the highway. And that was considered sort of cutting edge when that was open. But it's not just about computers. You know, it's now about algorithms, robots, and, you know, even things like 3D printing. So one of the cool things that that's probably not in this story, but BP does a lot is they print out the reservoir rocks and they kind of scale them up and they taught they they hand them around the room for all the exploration geologists to sort of touch and see the, you know, the porosity. So they've they've really gone, you know, full bore on the digital transformation. So they've done a lot of this. So they've done a lot of this. So they've done a lot of this early days. Like I said, it's I think it's pretty fair to be skeptical of a lot of this because we don't know exactly where the million dollar ideas are yet. But BP's argument is that we've we've done so much of this that we're actually getting, you know, really tangible results. And I'll just add one big piece of this, because since this is early stage is, you know, they've they've really invested in a big digital twin project. And so a lot of their gains are coming from reducing or reducing the cost of the production. So you know, if you get to keep a offshore production platform pumping oil, you know, that's that's a minute of a lot of money. And so taking that lost time out of their operations, that's where a lot of these gains are coming from and that they've also invested over time and the display so that they think of the human aspect of how to how to people from controllers, engineers interact with all of these things effectively. Yeah. Yeah. So if read that story, if you want to sort of get a holistic view of like what one giant super major is doing in the world, but we'll move on to number four report recounts the missed signals leading to a blowout that killed five. So this is this is a sad, tragic headline. Steve, you wrote this story. Yeah, that was I mean, really it was a story that it's a report that people should read the exploration on well, well in Oklahoma really didn't get much notice. I mean, five people died. It was one that you should have that you should have had the kind of impact that same condo had, but really almost had a few stories and not much follow up on it. And what was striking about reading this report that involved a rig by owned by Patterson, Utah, Utah and working for a little company I never heard of before this Red Mountain Energy it for 14 hours there was this building up of gas in the well and the crew just continued to miss signal after signal that there was this this you know, all this mud was coming out of the well because of the rising pressure inside. I mean, it really read like one of those horror movies where you can definitely see that something really horrible is going to happen at the end and nobody has seen and except you and it except it's real and for that reason it was pretty wrenching. I got a lot I saw I remember seeing comments afterwards on LinkedIn about you know, I've been in wells like that and there was always some bright guy that noticed it before it was too late. But I think anybody who's involved in drilling or just in the industry, it's worth reading just to think about what's going on. What's at stake? It's a sad reminder that despite all the technology, despite all the you know, the history that this industry has with safety incidents, they still happen and you know, this was onshore kind of in the middle of Oklahoma. Like you said, it didn't get near near the attention that Mcondo did. It also didn't result in a you know, long lasting subsea, you know, oil spill containment issue. But the fact is that what I read what I took away from this story was that those signs are always there, right? And so sometimes, you know, you can get away with it. But in this case, those signs, you know, were there for everybody to interpret and they just you know, they just kept going through with the job. Yeah, I mean, looking at it, it did seem like that rig and maybe a lot of rigs lacks any really good way to monitor what's going on when it comes to the amount of mud. I mean, the driller didn't really understand how these machines work. They just used this new spreadsheet based system that was going to tell them how much drilling mud they had in there so they knew if it was weighted upright. And it definitely seems like something that the industry should be following up on. So there is a standard that there are easy to use tools that drillers really understand so that they see what's going on and they don't make, you know, it reduces the risk of these kind of mistakes happening again. You know, my dad used to work on a on a rig offshore back in the day. He was a green horn roughneck and one of his jobs was whenever they had a kick was to go break 50 pound bags of bear right and throw that into the well. And he said that his professional life, that's still the scariest thing he had ever did was trying to mud up as they say and stop a kick. Couldn't imagine a more important person at that moment. Yeah. Well, we know that kick technology has come a long ways. We've written about this both of us, but it still has a long ways to go. Let's do number three. Number three. Okay. We're getting to almost to the finish here. These five companies are reinventing the U.S. Frac fleet. So this is a little bit of a teaser headline, but we looked at five different companies that were not necessarily frac, you know, pumpers, pressure pumpers. But these were people who were sort of coming with ancillary technologies. The nut of this is that the average frac, you know, pump technology that has been used for, you know, the last several years in oil and gas has really been a technology that hasn't seen much, you know, innovation for 20 years. So what needs to be done, though? How could you make it better? Yeah. A lot of the technologies center around fuel efficiency. So these things are, you know, the true gas guzzlers of the oil field. And, you know, depending on the contract, a lot of times it's the operator that eats the fuel cost, the bunkering cost. And so if you can, you know, turn off and on a frac pump when it's not being used automatically, then you can save thousands and thousands of gallons of diesel on a single job. What I learned through this was that nobody turns off the pump trucks during a frac job. Frac jobs, you know, today when you're doing a four-well zipper, that's like a month, maybe six weeks for a frac job. That's six weeks to a month that all of those units are staying on. And so that not only burns through fuel, but that eats up maintenance costs. So there was a company in this story called EKU Power Drives. It actually came from Stuttgart Germany. They were the founders were actually got their start working on Formula One race car technology. And when they do it on a field trip to the United States, they realized that one of the most fuel inefficient systems in the United States was your frac pump. And so that's just one example, but there was other companies. One was looking at vibration sensing because these not only do they take, they consume a lot of fuel, the frac pumps, they shake, they vibrate nonstop. Is that a good indication of what's about to break? If you monitor it, yeah. But some of these cavitations are happening at such a fast rate, you can't even see it with the human eye. So you actually do need sensor technology. And we looked at a couple others, but the main thing was can you make these things more fuel efficient and can you make them last longer? And then you reduce the overall lifetime cost of a frac pump. And so that's one example of that. So it was very interesting to me because that was sort of a hardware story and not like a rock story, which is with a lot of petroleum engineers, the core of our audience they go towards. But this one really resonated. That's why it's number three on our list for 2019. Right. Well, it does show that at a time when their rates keep going down, they've got to find some fairly cost effective ways of preserving equipment that gets chewed up really fast. Yeah, yeah. And as we know that we're going into another slowdown, trying to keep capital useful is pretty important. So number two on our list. Number two. In 2040, will there be jobs for petroleum engineers? Now, Steve, this is your story. We had Nathan Meehan on recently for a podcast. I was going to ask you to talk about that in a second. Yeah, okay. Don't get ahead of me. Now, yeah, that was a story that was kind of just dropped out of the blue. The every periodically BP does a briefing on what the outlook is and at the very last question was from a student, international petroleum engineering student asked, will there be jobs in the future? And they gave a very convincing at the time argument about, yes, there absolutely will be because really when you look at what we are predicting for demand, it's not what it was maybe two or three years ago, but there's an awful lot of demand and it will remain by 2050. 2050. Now, the thing is I've been thinking and certainly that strikes a chord at a time when petroleum engineering programs are at all time low or back at lows probably they reached I should say in the 90s, but that it's a time when there's a lot of doubt among the students about whether they're getting a degree that's going to mean a career for them. And, you know, the answer was fairly unequivocal, although the more I think about the more I'm concerned. I'm working on a story now looking at some of the things that Trent alluded to. You know, yes, there will be the demand for oil, but with the kind of things we're talking about here today, will there actually be the need for that many engineers to go after it? Is that is the relationship between engineers and per million barrels there anymore? So tell me talk to them about I think one of our best podcasts of the year. It was a very popular podcast episode, but it was also so this is the number this topic, you know, was the number two most read story on JPT of 2019. And the number one most read or downloaded paper from one Petro, our technical paper database, was written by former S.P. President Nathan Meehan. And that paper was dealing with this exact same question, which is, you know, is this the end of petroleum engineering as we know it, I believe is the title. And so, you know, as a society, you know, at the SBE, you know, this is obviously this resonates with us too because people are thinking about the future of their careers and the future of their lives. And I think what, you know, you've kind of talked about what Nathan focused on a lot is that we shouldn't be surprised by this in a time of volatility, but the, which the oil and gas industry always goes through a cycle of volatility. But the other side of this coin is that there's a lot of automation technology coming in. There's a, we've been talking about the digital stuff. And a lot of that is going to reduce the need for manpower in this business. So, you know, on one hand, you have just this long, lower for longer down cycle, and then you have software coming in. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty there. Yeah, it definitely seems like a world where you're going to have to be really good, not only at the basics of executing what you know, but figuring out ways to do things better, to innovate, to change the world and maybe even find ways where they won't need so many engineers. Yeah, and just to toot the horn a little bit, I mean, that's probably going to be more critical, you know, for this generation than they ever imagined because you're going to have to stay on top of things. The world's going to move faster, and you're going to have to learn from your peers more often, like you said, to sort of fight for those margins, fight for, you know, spot at the top. And so hopefully, you know, there are jobs for petroleum engineers in the future. I certainly think there are, and it's going to be interesting though. Definitely a time of change for this industry. Well, yeah, certainly from what we've seen on, you know, more automated drilling rigs, for example, they're really good at executing programs, but you're going to have to have humans to come up with new ideas how to do things better. Right, but we just talked about one of the other most popular stories was moving directional drillers into the office so that they can oversee not one but six rigs. And so as it's, you know, there's a kind of a phrase out there, more wells, less heads, and so, you know, more production with less people. And I think we're sort of starting to see the pieces of that come together. Now, what it means for people in the field versus petroleum engineers in the office, you know, remains to be seen. This is, you know, another thing where, you know, we're in such early innings, it's hard to make any real big calls. But obviously it's an important theme to our members and readers and no doubt we will, that's not the last of it that you're going to hear. Okay, we've kept them waiting long enough. What's number one? All right, the most read story of 2019 is, you know, the next. But first, sign up for the J.P.T. newsletter. This is a hassle free way to stay connected. You can read features on technology advancements and exploration and production.

We're going to get you a look at the latest technology developments. So, you know, we're going to get you a look at all the latest technology developments that are coming out ahead of the curve. We're going to include a link to this free newsletter and the show notes of the podcast. Click it. Get signed up and you're done. All right. So, number one on our list is you ready? You ready, Steve? Yeah, I'm guessing they're not going to guess this one. I'm guessing that you're right that this is probably going to be a little bit unexpected, but I'll go ahead and read it. Here's the headline. Number one, the U.K. releases 130 terabytes of oil and gas data. So this is our number one most read story by far. And I have a little theory. It's pretty simple. Free data, lots of it. People clicked. That's the irony of this industry. And by the way, the story is again by Matt Zoborowski is that on one hand, you know, the industry is stoking this huge, huge hunger for a generation of younger engineers to do data analysis, but the data is just oftentimes missing. Right. I see this a lot with startups and so you're, you know, a couple of years ago when I think the startup e"
SPE Live Podcast: Technical Director Series - Challenges and Questions to Improve DA/ML Applications in Reservoir Discipline,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Generative AI Implementations on Spatial Data. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on May 22nd, 2024. Welcome to this SPE Live on Generative AI Implementations on Spatial Data. My name is Yusuf Falola. I'm a PhD student in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University. I'll be your moderator today. Today's session is going to last for about 30 minutes, and we encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Dr. Cid Miska is an associate professor at Texas A&M University. He is a researcher and educator in the field of surface monitoring and forecasting for the exploration and production of surface health resources. Dr. Cid has published two books and developed nine technologies related to machine learning and electromagnetic sensing for energy and earth resource exploration. In 2018, he received the U.S. Department of Energy Early Career Award, and in 2020, he was honored with four international awards for his contributions to exploration geophysics and petroleum engineering. Dr. Cid holds a Bachelor of Technology degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and a PhD degree in petroleum engineering and geosystems engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Cid, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you, Yusuf. Glad that I'm talking to you early morning over here. Thank you. Yeah, sure. You're welcome. So let's get started by discussing some examples to illustrate how is AI being used by engineers and scientists in our field today. Great. Generative AI is all about creating new data that has similar characteristics with the training data. One simple example for all of us to relate to is, let's say you want to create a great music on guitar. How will you do it? You will go collect, let's say, 100 popular songs. You try to understand the rhythm, the pattern, the chord progression. And then once you learn these basic elements, the secret sauce behind good music, you will combine them to create your own new music. So that's what generative AI helps us achieve. So in terms of use, a lot of the uses are very new. It's a very new field. A lot of things are developing. There are excitement. There is some hype. There are some successes. So as engineers, how I see generative AI being used, I see it then being used in six areas. Number one is engineering design. Let's say you want to create a bridge. You want to create a bridge under a cost constraint, a material constraint. And you want the bridge to have a certain aesthetics, a certain style. For such purposes, for engineering design, to explore the design space, generative AI is a very good tool. The second use case for engineers is material discovery. Now we talk about energy transition. We need batteries. If you want to create batteries that are stronger, yet lighter, what composition, what elements should you combine together to create such a battery? Such problems can be solved through generative AI. Generative AI is being used for finding metal organic framework that can help us purify water, that can help us capture CO2, capture methane. So all these material discovery is where engineers are using gen AI. Now one use case that I'm seeing plenty often within energy companies is data summarization. What I mean by that is various oil and gas companies, engineering companies, they have a lot of historical data, a lot of reports, a lot of projects, a lot of emails. So they try to use generative AI to process all this historical data. Gen AI can relate reports with each other. It can relate reports between projects, between multiple years. So it gives you this holistic perspective of how decisions were made with such a system, with a data summarization system through generative AI. Engineers can ask questions. For example, whenever an operation was changed, how much production increase or decrease happened? Such questions can be answered through this holistic processing of data over multiple years, multiple projects and so on. Now the final two areas or final three areas where I see a lot of gen AI applications by engineer, one is code generation. I see personally a lot of young engineers, they use generative AI to generate codes that could help them do rapid prototyping, proof of concept. If they want to do some data visualization or data analytics in a particular way, they implement gen AI. A lot of engineers use gen AI for product design. What do I mean by product design? It can be a software product, a hardware product. But when we design a product, we want the product to interact seamlessly with users. As the user is using the product, we want to capture the data. So for such streamlined operation, automated workflows for product design, gen AI is a pretty good tool. It helps us improve user interface. It helps us improve user experience. And the final use case that I see for a lot of engineers is they use gen AI to create edge cases. When they generate new edge cases, they can test their hardware or software for presence of bugs, for presence of failures. So all these failure analysis of various hardware and software systems can be speeded up, automated through generating edge cases, edge test cases with gen AI applications. Just kind of my final words on gen AI used by scientists. Scientists use it to create new hypothesis, to detect anomalies, because in these anomalies, there may be new science. A lot of scientists are using gen AI for molecular discovery. They create molecules that can go to a particular target and perform a particular task. So a lot of use cases, a lot of exciting use cases, but some of them are very new. Let's see where the forefront evolves as the time progresses. Yeah, thank you, doctor. You've really shared a lot of insights, examples from civil engineering to the energy industry. So let's move ahead to our next question, which is now let's just go deeper into understanding the foundations of gen AI. What do you think are the key principles, techniques behind gen AI? So I'll try to break the principles into three steps. So gen AI, the word is very fascinating, but it has three steps. And these three steps are done over and over again. Step one, step one is to understand what is the basic secret sauce or what is the basic building block in the data? What makes a cat image look like a cat image? What makes music from Spain sound like music from Spain? So for that, we have to understand the basic building block. For example, you enter a house, when you enter a house, you can look at a room and you can say this room is a kitchen. You can look at another room and you can say it's a bedroom. Why? Because you know the basic building blocks present in these rooms. So that is step one. The algorithm tries to find the basic building block in the data. Step two is the algorithm quantifies the relationships between various building blocks. What I mean by that is, let's say we have a knife. Whenever there's a knife, there has to be a cutting board. Whenever there is a duck, there has to be a water nearby. So this is the quantification of basic building blocks in the data. So that's step number two. And how it is quantified? It is quantified in terms of probability distribution that helps us understand the order in which these basic building blocks are arranged and their relationships, their conditional probabilities between the building blocks. And the final step is the generative step, where the algorithm combines various building blocks to create new data. And this new data that is created has to be similar to the training data. That's the whole objective of GEN.AI. Now, GEN.AI is implemented in six different approaches. That is what I came across, six different approaches. The first one is generative adversarial networks. This is a very old concept in the sense I have come across generative adversarial networks for the last 10 years. So it's a pretty old concept. What's the goal in generative adversarial networks? There are two neural networks. You can imagine one to be a composer, a music composer, and the other to be a critic. The music composer composes music and the critic says, hey, this music is outdated. This is not new. So the composer keeps on improving. It tries to create new and new music. And the critic keeps on telling the composer whether the music is new or it's outdated. So this is a competition between two entities. And through this competition, through this adversarial effect, the network learns, the composer learns to create new music. That's approach number one. The second approach is variational autoencoder. Variational autoencoder is again an old concept where the data goes through filters. It goes through multiple filters. And as it goes to filters, the data is compressed. When the data is compressed, we identify the basic building blocks. Once we understand the basic building blocks and the relationship, then generative tasks can be performed. So that's variational autoencoder. The third task is or the third approach of generative AI is autoregression. Now, autoregression is pretty simple. You have an image. There's a pixel. This pixel is related to pixels around it. So you can use the information from pixels around it to predict what is present in that pixel. This is called autoregression. Whenever there's a duck, there will be water. Whenever there's a mountain, you will see the sky and the cloud. So this is what autoregressive methods do. They try to find relationships within the particular image. So I told you three approaches. GANs, VAE, autoregression. The fourth approach is recurrent neural network. What recurrent neural network does, it processes a sequence. By processing a sequence, it finds the basic building blocks and it finds how they are arranged, what's the relationship between them. A good example would be if you give recurrent neural network a Western music, it will identify that there's a particular piano sound, there's a particular violin sound, and this is what makes the Western music sound the way it is. The fifth approach is very new. This is transformer. The transformer is the powerhouse behind a lot of chat, GPT, Google Gemini applications that we have come across. So what is a transformer? Unlike RNN, which is looking at one sequence, a transformer looks at parallel sequences. It does multiprocessing. And through this multiprocessing, it tries to identify the building blocks and the relationship within a sequence, between a sequence, and that's how it helps us perform the generative task. And the final very interesting generative AI use case that I've seen over the last three years is called diffusion. This is an approach to GEN.AI, diffusion. What is diffusion? You have a good data. That good data is made noisy. As the data becomes noisy, the diffusion algorithm figures out how the data changes when noise is added. Through that, what the diffusion network understands is how to denoise to create the good data. So it learns the noising and then the reverse of noising, which is denoising. Through that, the diffusion network can take noise and generate new images, new audios, and it's shown a lot of potential in the generative tasks. So I hope I answered your question. What is the principle and the six approaches that I came across for generative AI implementations? Sure, you did. Like you've shared so much knowledge in the past few minutes from telling us about your key three principles and also like different ways that or different techniques you can use for GEN.AI purposes from GAN to diffusion. I'm hearing diffusion for the first time today, so I'm also taking that back to go and do more research. So thank you so much. Let's go to our next question, which is, can you just tell us how you have used GEN.AI on special data for engineering tasks? This is now more related to your own field. Yeah. So in this particular work where we used GEN.AI, you were also involved in this particular work. And this work was done with an energy company where we wanted to speed up geomodeling. So what is a geomodel? A geomodel is a realization of the subsurface. Now, in the subsurface, there's a lot of uncertainty. We don't know exactly how the porosity is distributed, where are the channels, how the channels intersect. So there's a lot of uncertainty. That's why we don't have just one representation of the subsurface. We have multiple representations of the subsurface that represent the various probability distributions in which the subsurface can exist. Permeability, porosity, saturation, facies, and isotropy and many more properties. Right. So this is a geomodel. A geomodel is a 3D representation. It represents the property distribution in a statistical fashion. In this work, we use GEN.AI to speed up geomodeling. What I mean by that is we want to create this 3D geomodel in a very fast way. We want to speed up that entire geomodel generation process. For this, we use GEN.AI. And as I mentioned, GEN.AI uses three steps. So the first step for us was to find the basic building blocks. And the second step was to quantify the relationship between the building blocks. So for the first step, which is to find the building blocks, we used something called Variational Autoencoder. There was an advancement that was done on Variational Autoencoder through the help of Yousef and some of the researchers in our team, where they brought in vector quantization with Variational Autoencoding, which was originally developed by Google. So they took that entire framework. They applied on training geomodels. When they applied it on training geomodels, they found the basic building blocks. These basic building blocks, you can imagine it to be a vector that has 10 numbers, 10 integers. So this is a way for you to understand what this basic building block is. So our team found these basic building blocks. These are vectors. Our step one is done. In step two, we used autoregression. What does autoregression does? We have a vector, which has 10 numbers. We wanted to understand conditional probability between these different numbers. Once we understand the conditional probability between these numbers, we are understanding the probability distribution of these building blocks. So for that, we use autoregression. For each given element in that vector, how will the numbers show up depending upon the past numbers? That is what conditional probability is. Once we quantified that, our third step is to mix, match these basic building blocks based on the quantified probability distribution to create new formulations of the building block. So that's where we are going into step three. For step three, what we did, we used this autoregression algorithm, which has quantified the probability distribution. From these probability distributions, we can sample these basic building blocks. So they represent whatever we learned from the training data. And the final step was to take these basic building blocks, run it through a decoder. Where does this decoder come from? The decoder comes from the variational autoencoder that we applied in the first step. So we run this basic building block through a decoder. The decoder takes the basic building blocks and generates the entire 3D geomodel. This entire approach, the training, the testing, it took us, let's say, close to one to two months to figure out the right architecture. Once we figured out the right architecture, once we designed the system, which took us another two to three months, so in total six to eight months of work was invested in creating this entire workflow. Once that is done, our entire geomodel generation process happened in seconds. We can generate 1,000 3D geomodels within one minute, which is very fast. And the geomodels that we're generating, they represent the subsurface. You can imagine them to represent, let's say, one kilometer by one kilometer by 100 feet thick reservoir. So that is one example where we used generative AI on geomodels and spatial data. Yeah, thank you so much for giving us that example. I think that's something a lot of our audience would understand better because I believe they are more familiar with the subsurface. So now, Yusuf, what I want to know from you, because you were involved in this work, you were very heavily involved on the encoding side of things where we wanted to find out the basic building blocks. You've worked on a lot of deep neural networks, large models. So tell me, from your experience, when you create these networks to work on spatial data or let's say spatial temporal data, what kind of challenges, what kind of limitations do you face in getting these advanced AI methods to work with spatial temporal data? Share your experiences. Yeah, so that's a very good question. And I'm going to answer that generically on that three major headings. One would be in terms of the data set. Secondly, in terms of the model itself. And third would be like some other issues. So on this hands, this response would like the generic on the challenges we face in our industry in working with spatial temporal data on on on with gen. AI models. So talking about the data sets, I believe everyone will agree with me. The first issue we have is like vulnerability of data. You know, for general models, you need a lot of data set to train them for them to be able to walk appropriately. So the unavailability of data is the number one challenge. But personally, one challenge I've also encountered related to data set is the size of these of these are spatial data sets. So as data set can be so huge. And one of my projects related to like CO2 forecast, CO2 storage forecast, I have a data set with just 250 samples. But the size of these data sets is about 11 gig. So 11 gigabytes like the day to day PC is not going to be able to run it. So I had to use a PC with about 250 gig gram to be able to process it. This data set actually run the model itself. So that's another challenge that we face working with spatial temporal data. I tell you, I will be the time to take to generate the data set is another issue, because in my own case to generate one sample takes me like an hour. So imagine if you want to generate a thousand, so you need like a thousand hours to generate your data. So that's a lot of time. So that's another challenge that we face working with spatial temporal data and including and training them with general models. Then lastly, related to data set is that we all know that the geology everywhere is different. So if you develop a model using a geology of let's say Texas, for instance, you have to like try to train another model if you want to apply if you have to retrain the model, you want to apply it to a data set in Norway, for example. So in that case, although you may have to you may do something called transfer learning that can help you fast track this process. But that's definitely another challenge. Next, talking about the models itself. The first thing is the complexity of the model, which goes back to the computational course I talked about earlier. So some of these models cannot run on the day to day PC. So you definitely need PCs with high storage capacity, high RAMs to be able to run these, train these your general models on this data set. Secondly, I will say that in some cases, our data set has passed. For instance, in my own case, I'm predicting CO2 saturation. So which means that the CO2 is migration in the subsurface as only it only covers a few space compared to the large subsurface area. So it means all the other areas would be zeros, for example, and then you have values in only a few specific areas. So this past data set are always trouble for AI models to be able to predict or even learn from. So that's another challenge that I think that we face training general models on our own special temporal data. Lastly, talking about other issues, I think these are general issues in our industry. One is the privacy concern concerning data set. So companies highly share data set due to privacy concerns. So and that limits the amount of data available for us to train this general models on. And lastly, I'll mention that the acceptability of machine learning in our industry, I'm not sure it's so it's so high the percentage because even when you train your machine learning model, AI models like the execs, they will still want to still want to you to like tell them like give physical examples on how this thing works for them to be able to like accept it, accept your results, make decisions based on what you have done with this model. So I think some of the challenges I feel we face in our industry are applying general models on special temporal data. Yeah. So thanks for that. We have eight more minutes. So maybe what we can do is I can kind of conclude our discussion and then we can move on to Q&A. So for concluding the discussion, I just want to reiterate what you mentioned, the challenges and especially challenges related to creating general AI models on spatial data. Now, now when you take talk about general AI, right, chat, GPT, Google, Gemini, these are the most popular. How much time, how much effort, how much data went into creating these systems. For example, if you just talk about a large language model, it takes somewhere around 10 million books. It has to learn from 10 million books. That's how it became smarter. For doing this learning on 10 million books, it requires energy that is equivalent to 100,000 households, the annual energy consumption of 100,000 households. So it requires a lot of energy. It requires a lot of data and it generates a lot of CO2. The amount of CO2 that is being generated by these LLM models, let's say typically 100 billion parameter models to train them. It generates, let's say 50,000 metric tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 500 cars running for their entire lifetime. So there's a big footprint of CO2 energy consumption and data consumption for these large language models and generative AI. For spatial data to be in particular, it occurs in a lot of different forms. It occurs in a lot of different formats, civil engineering, environmental engineering, oil and gas, defense, agriculture, logistics, operations, retail, all these different sectors. They use different forms of spatial data. Some spatial data is in the form of satellite images. Some of them are in the form of LIDAR. Some of them are in the form of traffic data, GPS data, location data, routes. Seismic map is an example of spatial data. Plenty of times on top of your spatial data, there will be temporal component. So these datasets are coming in different formats from different sources with different resolution. And to combine all these data together for processing them carefully to extract information is always challenging. Spatial data is high dimensional. Being a high dimensional data to create good generative AI models, we need a lot of data. We need a lot of training time, a lot of GPUs. And as soon as you increase the number of GPUs, you start increasing the carbon footprint, the energy footprint of such tasks. So with that, Yusuf, we can look into the questions if there is any from the audience or else we can discuss a little more. Yeah, I think there is a question here from LinkedIn. The question goes to us. I can see data summarization is useful for WRFM for additional production from existing assets using multidisciplinary data. What challenges with data need to be tackled prior to applying Gen. AI? Yeah, so especially from a spatial data point of view, as I mentioned, resolution, different formats, mismatch of the data to kind of bring them together, stitch them together in time, in a real extent is always a challenge. So some strategies to overcome these challenges with spatial data. Number one, data augmentation. Whenever we have spatial data, plenty of times mirroring them, rotating them helps us increase the data set size. It helps us to train our models better. So data augmentation is one. We have to be very focused on data cleaning and data preprocessing. Yusuf mentioned something called transfer learning. What is the use of transfer learning? You take a source model. The source model has seen enough data. You take it to a new condition, to a new area of investigation. There you don't have enough data. So for those cases, you take your source model and train it, fine tune it, perform feature extraction on it. That's an example of transfer learning, which can help you overcome data limitations in terms of quantity or sometimes in terms of quality. We need a lot of compute. We need a lot of cheap energy as long as we have access to a lot of compute, cheaper energy, training these GNI models on large data sets are possible. And if you look at the architecture of these generative AI methods, plenty of times we have to apply strong regularization. With strong regularization, we ensure that these GNI don't hallucinate. They stay focused. They give us meaningful results. Regularization can occur in form of dropouts, weight decay. Plenty of times there is a human in the loop for reinforcing the network to generate sensible, reliable results. So these are some ways in which we can overcome the challenges of data. Thank you so much, Dr. Seed, for the response to your question. I think that's the only question we have here. So if you could just like as a roundup, just give us a few more examples on how GNI contributes to the innovation and problem solving in engineering projects generally. Yeah, so for engineers, what I'm seeing a lot is creating new materials. That is one area where I see a lot of GNI uses. There's a material called MOF, Metal Organic Framework. It's a combination of an inorganic entity, an organic entity, along with something linking them. So this is a pretty complex structure. You can create such structures to act as filtering systems, things that can filter out impurity from water, things that can filter out CO2 from gas. So to create such complex structures with specific properties, with specific costs in mind, that's where GNI is coming into picture. There's a large database of material properties. It's not possible to experiment on each and every combination. So GNI can learn from this material databases. It can learn from simulated data, molecular dynamic simulation, DFT simulation. And by combining all that, it can create new structures with specific properties that can hopefully address your needs. Let's say your energy transition needs or a monitoring need or some kind of a material construction need. Yeah, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us today and for creating time to speak with us today. This has been the SPE Live Podcast."
SPE Live Podcast: Building the Bridge to the Future of Energy Engineering,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live, the energy transition, envisioning a lower carbon future. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on July 24th, 2023. And now your moderator, Mervyn Azeta. Hello and welcome to this SPE live on the energy transition, envisioning a lower carbon future. My name is Mervyn Azeta and I'm the global flexible work and culture project manager for SOB. In this role, I'm responsible for enabling enterprise-wide radical flexibility and influencing strategic cultural shifts to drive high performance. Today's SPE live is expected to last about 30 minutes. I encourage you to engage during the program, share your thoughts and reactions, ask questions. We would love to answer them as time permits. Before starting our conversation, I'd like to invite you to attend the energy transition symposium scheduled to take place on the 22nd to 23rd of August in Houston, Texas. The theme for this event is Transitioning for a Better Energy Future. We hope to deliver a prominent and dedicated energy transition event, collecting and disseminating knowledge from industry leaders, technical experts, academicians, practitioners, financial community and ESG leaders. And together, through collaboration, advance the conversations, technology and exchanges that will move our industry forward. For more information about this event and how to register, please scan the QR code displayed on the screen. Now, it's an incredible honor and pleasure to introduce our guests, three dynamic, exceptional and transformational energy leaders. Our first guest is Alison Anderson-Brook, Chief Sustainability Officer at Baker Hughes. She oversees Baker Hughes' energy transition strategy by driving sustainable operations, supporting commercial energy transition solutions for customers, and ensuring market creation of the solutions via stakeholder engagement and policy development. Next, we have Alexi Bisotsky, General Manager of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage, CCUS, as part of Chevron New Energies. Often described as a strategy translator, he's a debt and leading team to convert aspirational goals into reality amidst complex technical, business and geopolitical challenges, as well as deploying CCUS solutions to accelerate progress toward the lower carbon ambitions of Chevron and its customers. Last, but certainly not the least, is David Reed, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Marketing Officer at NOB. David is a pioneer and champion of strategic growth and innovation. He's a pioneer in strategic growth in business, business models, machine tech designs, technology, and industrial digitization. He's an author, innovator, a true DEI champion. He's founded several organizations, including REDEMP, a pro bono crowd sourcing organization, and currently serves on multiple boards. Alexi and David, welcome to this SBE Live. Thank you. To reiterate, the topic of our conversation is the energy transition, envisioning a lower carbon future. So let's get started with some basics. Alison, I'm sure a lot of our audience have heard about the energy transition. It's a word or phrase that's creating both excitement and anxiety for many in our industry today. But can you briefly explain for those that may not know what exactly it is and what it means to you in particular? So the origin of that, I always start with the main origins that everybody level sets, because the way we use it inside of our sector is a little bit different than how the rest of the world uses it. So the rest of the world, the energy transition was meant to mean the phase out of fossil fuels. And so we would also stay in line with the Paris Agreement, which means limiting temperature increase to one and a half degrees Celsius. Now, how many companies are using that term is related to just looking for the lowest carbon future, enabling the use of fossil fuels, but making sure that we have abatement solutions to get those to net zero. Okay, so just depending on the audience, they use a slightly different definition. Wonderful. Thank you very much for that. I think it makes sense. So I'm going to go to Alexi. Alexi, what's the role of oil and gas producers, service companies, and other ecosystem actors in the energy transition? Thank you, Marin. Yes, and maybe I'll just start off by adding a little bit to what Alexi said about energy transition and what it is. So if you look at our energy systems, we have been in transition for many years, so it's not new. It is really an extension of what we always have seen. At the beginning of the petroleum age, in the mid 1800s, most of the oil was used for kerosene lamps. In the early 20th century, it was developed with petroleum combustion engines, the development of petroleum products, transportation, and then of course, later on, natural gas replaced coal as a cleaner fuel for the power sector. So energy had always been in that transition, so to speak. And really, there are two key ingredients necessary to ensure successful energy transition. So one is the capital, and you need a lot of it. And two is capabilities. Another is the technical and commercial expertise necessary to build complex projects and to operate them and to operate in the emerging markets. And if you look at the oil and gas sector, you will see that it has both of those ingredients. We have the capital and we have the capabilities. So really, the oil and gas sector is uniquely situated to lead energy transition and continue providing people with reliable, affordable, and now ever cleaner energy. And I do believe that the oil and gas sector can and will play a significant role, and in many cases, leading role in transition of energy systems. So the second part of the question was really of role of other partner organizations. And if you look at the path to net zero, it is a narrow path and requires extreme partnerships and requires all hands on deck. As to reach the net zero by 2050, it will require rapid deployment of technologies that are available today. But also, it requires technologies that have the still in the test stages. So we need to have an oil and gas sector with extreme partnership with technology companies to help to increase and scale up technology that will be absolutely critical to getting the net zero by 2050. So I think oil and gas industry will lead energy transition. Energy transition does require partnerships and it requires all hands on deck approach. Absolutely, I agree with you. I think that the transition truly requires collaborative action across borders, countries, sectors, and industry. Besides, given the complexity and scale of this transition in particular, and its interdependencies across different systems, there's not a chance that one stakeholder group or industry can tackle the challenge alone. So now I'm going to double click on the role of the oil and gas industry. And David, I was curious to know why it's important for the oil and gas sector and other industries or associated industries to decarbonize current operations. Well, I like what Alison and Alexa said, so I'll continue to add in game. I think often we get polarized. And that's our challenge right now, as everyone seems to look at this as a one side or other thinking. And so moving away from that, that's really important for us, is to not get yourself in a camp, but to start thinking about the importance of something that is coming our way and we need to respond to. And the beauty of it, if I look at my career and the things we've done, particularly deep water and shale, big challenge, didn't know how to do it, we're going to work it out. But big opportunities. And I think that's the way to look at this. It's another big challenge, big opportunity moment for us. And we're wired that way from working with other industries. You find that they're not as fast at dealing with things. And sometimes we think of ourselves as slow often amongst ourselves. You'll hear everyone saying we're not rapid at developing. And that's just because it frustrates us because we have a desire to be fast. I think our whole ecosystem is driven to make things happen. And we're very business-orientated, very capital understanding. And it sometimes frustrates people just to look at the capital it's going to cost to build and to do this stuff. But the right thinking is this is a challenge for us. This is exactly our moment as an industry. We are agile. We've done amazing things. I think people who come into the industry learn how amazing we are at jumping on technology and applying things, at trying things. We're very good at it. And that's exactly what is needed now. It is coming. And there's always that thought of maybe if I bury my head in the sand, we're not going to have to deal with this. But the truth is it's opportunity. And I think when people understand that opportunity is the name of the game, you start to really sit back and go, what can we do here? And there's a ton. There's a ton of work for all of us in making this happen and making it better. For our company, we were reached out, I think it was maybe seven years ago, maybe a bit longer. The renewables, people were asking for help. And I love that. They looked at us as they actually, we had some people come to a meeting, were shocked by the type of people we had and said, you've got really, you know, mixed generations and diversity and agility. And I just didn't expect it. And you think you can help us. We have problems that need solved. And I think that's the bottom line is opportunity for all of us. Yeah, absolutely right. I thought you shared very interesting thoughts there. I really do think as well that decarbonization enables new phases of value creation for us as an industry and helps us drive sustainable growth as well. Brilliant. So you mentioned renewables when you were talking. And obviously I'm curious to know, Alexi, what is the role of other energy firms, renewables, CCUS, you are a CCUS manager, obviously in Chevron, you have a lot of insights into that. So I'm curious to hear, what's the role of geothermal, hydrogen, all of these different energy sources or resources? And how can we leverage technology and innovation to achieve a sustainable high tech and lower carbon future? Absolutely. Good question. Thank you, Mervyn. So I'll try, I'll start the answer and I'll ask David to add towards the end. And what I like about energy transition that really, if you look at the pathway to net zero by 2050, what you'll see that it's a portfolio approach. Right. So we need all to work to get to net zero. So we need renewables, we need CCUS, we need geothermal, we need solar, wind, nuclear, all those things that part of portfolio that's required for us to get to net zero. So from the portfolio of technologies, energy transition is truly an end game, right? We can't choose winners and losers today. It is a portfolio approach. It is an end game and you need all to work. So let me now give you a little bit to the CCUS and give you some insights there. So there is no net zero without CCUS, right? If you look at the consensus, there's a consensus among forecasts that net zero emissions by 2050 is not possible without the scale deployment of CCUS and other carbon dioxide removal technologies. For example, if you look at IEA and in their sustainable development scenario, they rely on 15% of project emission reduction will come from CCUS. And also if you look at IPCC 1.5 special report, CCUS is a must. So CCUS today, CCUS on point sources is really very, very, very cost effective way to reduce large volume of CO2 quickly. And by deploying CCUS on massive scale, we can really make a dent on CO2 emissions globally. So that's the CCUS perspective. And I'll turn it over to David to comment a little bit more on renewables on the business side. Sure. Thanks, Alexei. For me, it's a bit different because we make things. So we already were in a lot of other energies, not in as big a way as we have become lately. But I tend to think of it kind of as three Rs, if we can just think of it that way. The rejuvenate, what we already have. So CCUS is a good example, taking things and power systems have seen a huge change, particularly in US land, where we're starting to learn how to find more efficient ways to use power, contain power, get more efficient in that space. So there's tons of rejuvenation work that needs to go on. Then repurposing is really interesting, particularly for us, we're Jackup designers, and we make jacking systems and we make cranes. And so we've actually moved very heavily into the installation business for offshore wind. And we have floating wind design. Geothermal is a perfect example of this idea that you're repurposing something you already do. And so in geothermal, we're doing tons of work. There's a lot of products that are going on. But I think that's for everyone to understand it's drilling. They certainly didn't want us when we turned up and they knew it was a downturn in the oil business. And so as we were trying to invent new things, they're like, we've tried it all, please don't do anything. But there's a whole new wave in geothermal that has happened because of oil and gas, people putting time and effort into say, here's where invention is needed. It comes really from shale. But that thinking of you can invest in technology and take a low cost thing and make it perform better. And that's what's happening inside of geothermal. And then when you go to the third R, which is to reposition, all of these businesses have been trying to get cost out. And so we find that it's solar, we find that in wind, and it's not really through innovation that they've been moving. And so we've got new businesses in those spaces, and we're actually solving it biogas. There's a lot of things that were new and opportunistic for us to say, as manufacturers, we can solve problems. A simple example would be in wind towers on land, a couple of things we learned that when you try to get higher to get more wind, they were struggling to get the cheap towers coming in from outside of the US to get under bridges. And so we came up with this system working with another company to build a tower on site. And so we actually bring a manufacturing system into the field. And then we developed a custom type crane that apparently everyone would be using traditional cranes. And they were costing too much because they wait on weather. But it's windy. So you're going to get waiting on weather problems. And so we designed a more stable crane system. So I think that type of thinking from our industry is available across the board. And so that whole kind of getting yourself into a new market is definitely something we can all consider as well. I love how you use the power of three there with the three Rs. Very brilliant. And I know that Allison has a very interesting perspective on that question as well. So I'd invite Allison to share thoughts. You know, the I think what has happened a lot is we're so focused on the longer term event horizon in the energy transition. So there's a lot of excitement about all of the things that that are two other panelists here mentioned. But oftentimes, we forget about that sort of bit that's right in front of us. And so a big part of what companies can do today in our sector sits on efficiency. OK. And not simply that that that older concept of what efficiency means in terms of drilling wells faster, you know, et cetera, meaning that in the energy transition, efficiency looks like you're you have your normal efficiency gains, but you layer on emissions reduction with it. OK. And so any company that can really focus on the emissions they can reduce today in their operations is the first step towards getting to net zero. OK. So you need to do that while you're you're helping prove up some of the other frontier spaces like like hydrogen and other areas, because those still have some pretty major hurdles that we've got to make sure we can jump over. All right. And so so for now, just let us not forget that there's a lot to be gained in having a much more efficient and sustainable operations today in the areas that we operate. That means every individual gets to drive the energy transition forward, because that takes a choice from every single person within a company. I like that. I also, there's a challenge that we face in that we're looking at huge manufacturing opportunities for a manufacturer. We almost need a scope for, you know, break because we're going to be making all these things. We actually have massive construction plans ahead. Beyond anything we've done in oil and gas, but we will get punished because we're going to use carbon in the process. And so back to Alison's point, the opportunity is even as companies, we're going to have to find ways to do things better. And as a manufacturer, there's tons of pressure. We definitely could use some scope for if we look at the work we're doing and how it helps our clients. And we get no benefit for that. And we're actually more punished. But but this this actually means tons of manufacturing. And that's a that's a really tough pressure to put on. But an opportunity to do that Yeah, that's interesting. Thank you, David. And thank you, Alison, for sharing this. I do want to come back to the fact that there's so much we can do even now to support the journey to the energy transition and just thinking about talents and training. I'm curious to know, Alison, what's your opinion on the role of education, training and professional organizations like SP in supporting this energy transition? You know, there's there's some, I guess, rhetoric out there about this idea that we would upskill the oil and gas sector, right? I'd like to point out something that has been brought up multiple times in listening sessions with with people I've been working with. That makes it seems like we're not skilled. So that term upskilling implies that you're you're training more because we weren't skilled to begin with. And that's something that we're because we weren't skilled to begin with. That couldn't be more false. Okay. There's not an upskilling issue here. It really the future for the sector and the role of SP is taking highly skilled people and then applying that amazing skill set to a different problem. Right. And so so the future sits in being able to give real world examples to apply experience and knowledge of decades to just different problems. That's right. And so in some cases, yeah, if you're a college graduate, you'll you'll be trained on on something new that might not be a core oil and gas or something else in there. Maybe you'll start out as a geothermal drilling expert. Okay. But there's a whole breadth of experience that we would be leaving on the table if we didn't think about utilizing the skills that we have working for us today. I think SP is a group well positioned to help make that transition. That's well said, Allison. And maybe I'll just add. And that's the question we get a lot from the actually students as they graduate universities. I think it's important as Allison mentioned to say that our skill sets are very transferable. Right. So we have the amount of things we have to build to support energy transition is amazing. Right. So we are the beginning of the next industrial revolution. And the skill set that all people went to schools for and practice for many, many years. That's what will be required to make that happen. So our skill sets, folks know gas is very transferable. And we can migrate between we can support the energy transition very effectively. One thing you always need to do you need the curiosity, right? There's a lot of new knowledge just coming out. That's very important. We can we continue to learn and we continue to be curious and we continue to try new things and support this energy transition. Wonderful. I see we're doing pretty well with time. So I'd like us to take some questions from the audience. And my first question would likely go to David and it's from Omar Tahir. Is oil and gas drilling revolutionizing mining industry too? Are players transitioning from open pit mining to actual wells to attract to extract lithium, boron, copper and other special metals? Addressingly, geothermal and lithium go well together. So that is a process that is being discussed right now. We have a number of jobs where we're actually looking at lithium production through wells, which fits well with geothermal. There are places where we are working on drill ship conversions to do offshore mining in deep water where there is some of these rare earth minerals on the seafloor. A lot of emotions about that, but that is going on. And we do play in mining. I don't know if I would say that this is a wholesale thing that's happening, but it's certainly an opportunity to consider. Okay, very good. So we take the second question also from LinkedIn by Omar. What is the biggest challenge bottleneck in every speaker's opinion to meet our objectives of 1.5 degrees C supply chain materials or technology adoption or adaptation? Pardon. I think all of you could take this one really. Sounds good. I think I can start and other speakers will add. So to me, the energy transition, it is the policy enabled markets, right? So the first thing that's required is a policy that's capable to move us forward, right? So I think that's the first bottleneck. And the United States, now we are well situated. I think we have a sufficient amount of public funding to start that transition. Then the second, of course, is a public acceptance. We have to build a lot of things and we haven't built it for many, many years, right? And the idea of energy transition being ever clean and won't impact people around it is false, right? You'll be building things around population and I think public acceptance will be the second challenge. And the third one is really regulatory, right? To make it fast, to execute things at the speed that's required to meet the 20-feet targets, you got to approve all the projects a lot faster than we do now and move them forward. So those are three things that are on top of my mind, but they'll manage both and will prevail. All right, Allison? Yeah, so I think it's a really different tactic. There's the, from the perspective of what businesses are doing, what are the challenges, right? Which is a lot of what Alexi was talking about. But remember, businesses, even if we get all the businesses in the world to get to net zero, there's still a huge consumerism part that's driving a lot of bad behaviors. And so I think, truthfully, the challenge for the meeting the Paris Agreement is that people are unwilling to sacrifice certain things or they think that they have to sacrifice things instead of just making smarter choices about the use of certain products, being smarter about power, etc. But consumerism continues to be one of the single greatest challenges in a warming climate, okay? Because there's, you know, business only gets us so far. And so I just want to point that out. And this is a challenge that we close every meeting. I can, I ask this question every meeting, I'm sure my staff are tired of it. But we always say today's sustainability challenge, what are you going to do? What choice are you going to make? What are you going to commit to? Okay. And if everybody took that on and did one thing, I'd be willing to bet we'd get a huge percentage of the way there. All right. I like that. Baby, do you want to add something? Sure. Yeah. Because I think we're in the depths of planning and executing giant projects. And all of them are trapped with the same issue. We have these great theories, great conferences, great technologies. And to, I don't think there's a single one misses out on the infrastructure problem. And who's going to do what work and how are we going to be able to do this? And so there's tons and tons of theory about big things we can do, but getting power to something, transmitting power, moving power, moving hydrogen, which is another interesting challenge we're looking at. I mean, our first big wind project looks like it's going to power platforms, like wells, drilling and production. And because it's simple, you can put the power straight into those systems, but actually coming onto land at transmission. So there's tons of government work to be done, as well as business work to work out how are we going to get all these different forms of energy around the world to function? And so that's a big challenge. And the other side of that challenge is how are we going to get affordable energy to places in the world that desperately need it? And that's another part of that is those are both things that tend to not come up, but they are actually the big issues. Great. So let's take one question from SP Energy Stream. And the question is from S. Bateja. Should we not try to innovate novel value added products from petroleum to sustain the importance of the industry? Who would like to take that? I can talk a little bit. I mean, we're seeing this in Saudi right now where we're a large fiberglass company and we're solving a lot of problems in that space. One of the interesting things I've seen is people are so used to steel. It's the answer for everything. And it's actually been an interesting journey looking at what's possible. And with Saudi, they were just so realized that this is a hydrocarbon based product that I make. I don't make steel. And so it's been an interesting transition for them and others to start realizing we need to look at different materials, new materials, and there are hydrocarbon solutions in the middle of that. If I could add on that, David, both of our companies are manufacturers, right? And we are using flexible pipe to transition some of the steel pipe to be lined with something that's more extruded. So that's an example of a little bit of innovation there. There's a second kind of innovation that I point to. It's taking technology that you applied in one sense, being able to fine tune that and then use it for other applications, sort of like the reskilling versus upskilling thing that I spoke about earlier. And so a lot of what we're working on is used across oil and gas, CCS, hydrogen, like you need compressives for anything where you're going to want to move a gas. So it's a very logical outgrowth from what we're doing today in terms of being able to move gas and liquids around. There's a lot of innovations we had. Yeah, that's a good point, Alison. Flexible pipe is actually one of the great solutions right now for hydrogen transmission, which is really interesting. So we do the same. It was used originally just for eliminating connections and allowing... It's an innovation that just eliminates work and weight. I mean, these systems, I mean, we've been doing gas stations for about 50 years. And when you dig them up, the pipe is the same. So it's an interesting product for longevity and nobody thinks of the waste of steel and how it rots. So yeah, there's tons of that. Totally. All right. Thank you so much. I've seen we've come to the end of the show and I thought that was a very great conversation. There's definitely a lot more to come at the symposium. So please do well to register and attend the symposium in August. We're looking forward to seeing you there. Alexi, Alison and David, thank you for joining us on this SPE live and sharing such brilliant insights. And to our audience, thank you for joining us today.

SPE Live Podcast: The Role of Pressure Transient Analysis in CCUS Projects,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the April 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future, how members can help improve the industry's public image. And now your moderator, SPE Senior Manager of Communication and Energy Education, Paige McCowen. Hello, I'm Paige McCowen, Senior Manager of Communications and Energy Education at SPE. I am pleased to join the 2024 President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast episode. This month, Terry will focus on how SPE engages with our external stakeholders and more importantly, how we can help improve the industry's public image through programs like Energy for Me. Hi, Terry. Good morning, Paige. It's great to be back with you. I think the last time we spoke was at my second episode in October. So a lot has happened since then. I think we've had five episodes, four or five episodes. And of course, the goal of all along, as we kind of talked about in September, was to try to help our members create their energy future and in particular, how to use their SPE membership to do that. So this month, like you said, I wanted to talk about something that I think is really pretty critical to our future. And it's not just our future, our members future, or even SPE's future. But I think it's important to the industry and one could argue humankind's future. I'm really glad you're talking about this, Terry. Obviously, this is something that's close to my heart, but also the members. I hear members talk about this a lot. So what are the public image issues that face the industry? Well, look, first of all, I agree with you. It's probably one of the most common questions I get as I travel is, you know, I get the question of what can SPE do to help our image? In fact, if we go back to our strategic plan that we put together a year and a half ago, our public image was one of the top five concerns by our membership, along with how are we going to attract the next generation? And I think those are go hand in hand. So look, I think we need to remember our industry has always had a lot of environmental scrutiny. Some of it is well deserved. But one thing I want to just point out is I don't think I've ever met anyone in our industry who's not concerned about the environment. In fact, arguably, most or and a lot of our members maybe join the industry because this industry is an outdoor type industry. I mean, what we do is is out on on platforms and on out in the nature. And so most of us come from an environmental background. And so we're certainly concerned about the environment. Of course, today, the biggest pressure we're getting is on climate change and the global warming that's caused by the emissions that's generated by the products, the combustion of the products we produce. And those are all valid concerns. And there's something that we are concerned about. And I think if you talk to anybody in an industry they're working on. But unfortunately, we rarely hear about the benefits that our industry is bringing to humanity, the benefits that oil and gas provides, whether it's energizing nearly everything we do and every industry that's out there or just in all the petrochemicals and the everyday products and conveniences that are made from oil and gas. You know, our products fuel and impact almost every aspect of our lives. And I think that's the message that we kind of need to continue to get out there. You know, I won't I won't repeat what we talked about in September, October. But again, quite literally, we save lives of better humanity. The other thing is, as I've said before, you know, I still believe passionately that our industry is best positioned to solve today's energy challenge. And the energy challenge, of course, is continuing to meet humanity's desire and need for affordable and accessible, reliable and secure and green and decarbonized energy. So that's the challenge. And I think we're up to it. But there's really two big problems that come into play if we want to meet that challenge when it comes to public image. And the first is if we want to solve this trilemma or this challenge, then we're going to need the best and the brightest entering and staying in our industry. And so if we don't have that, then we won't be able to solve the challenges. And then the second is just investment. Some might argue that our industry has been under invested in the last several years. But if, you know, if our image is not not good or worse, we're demonized as in the public, then we we may reduce our investments in our tech in the companies and in our technology. So it's just really important that we that we address public image. I think humanity, maybe you could argue the planet depends on us to keep doing what we do and meeting that challenge. Yeah, you're you're definitely right there. And I like the point you make about people in the industry being concerned about the environment. A lot of people think, as you said, that that we're not. But it is an ongoing problem and it's a huge undertaking. But what can we do to change public perception? Yeah, of course, that's the main question. And that's what's on the question on everybody's minds. Let me just give you a few insights. I was in February, I was at IPTC in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, and we I served on the president's panel and this panel was made up of the presidents of the four sponsoring societies, so AAPG, EAGE, SEG and SPE. And we the title of it was, you know, discussing strategies for attracting and retaining the next generation. And so a lot of this was tied up into public image and public perceptions. And some of the points that kind of came out of that panel was, first of all, we really need to engage students at a very young age. I think a lot of times we think in terms of college and university, but really it needs to go down to at least the high school and if not the middle school and grade school level. So that's the first. And the reason that's important is because actually it kind of steps back from that. And that is just getting students into STEM programs, period. In many areas like the US, STEM and Role Es are declining already. That doesn't that's not petroleum engineering. That's just STEM. So it starts young. And then, of course, then we, of course, as they get older, we start to help them understand the benefits of our industry and what it brings to humanity. The other thing that we kind of talked about is sometimes we get caught up in kind of our image of of what we portray ourselves. And we do a lot of really cool things. And look, if you're a young student and you're trying to figure out what career to go into, you're going to be wanting to do high tech and things like that. And we do that every day. So I think that's a big part of it. And then the last thing is, you know, we really need to engage our teachers, guidance counselors, you know, your friends and your family, the people that you work with. And, you know, one of the points I made at the end was that I think the most important thing our societies can do and or the companies they work for is to improve to or the most important thing we can do to improve our public image is to equip our members or equip their employees with the tools they need so that they can go out and engage students, you know, and teachers and their friends and family on the benefits of what we do. What we do is neat and cool and high tech. And I think that's where we start. I mean, we have one hundred twenty seven thousand members worldwide. And one hundred twenty seven thousand members can do a lot more than a single entity. So I see that as our critical role at S.P.E. Yeah, you're right about that. I completely agree. I believe focusing on students and teachers is a great way to reach out to the communities we live in and to share knowledge. So how is S.P.E. equipping our members and what tools are they are we using? Yeah, so it all starts with energy for me. That's our global educational outreach program. It was actually launched probably almost 20 years ago. And it really provides, you know, what I would guess I would term an exploration and production curriculum. And it's something that we partnered with NEED, which is the National Energy Education Development Project to develop. And the energy for me, if you go onto that platform, you'll see there's a lot of discussion about our industry and the positives, but it has a lot of hands on activities. And these hands on activities teach the science behind our industry and maybe try to demystify some of it. The cool thing is it's translated into several languages, so you can it's easily deployable to our global membership. Some of the activities that we have in there are simple ones, maybe that discuss density or show what porosity means. And there's also some more sophisticated that talk about enhanced oil recovery and perhaps perforating well casing, things like that. So that's, I would say, the major portion of what we do. The other part, that's the I would call the hands on part. And then, of course, we have a book that we published with DK Publishing in about 15 years ago called Oil and Natural Grass Book. I have it on my desk here, actually. And that book is basically to help if you go through that book, it really helps you understand how do you convey what we do, why what we do is important, to kind of the talking points that you can give to your friends and family. And it, too, is translated into multiple languages. So we have that opportunity. So I would say it's a twofold tools, Energy for Me and then that book. Yeah, it's a great program. I'm a little biased, but I think it's an awesome program. And I know a lot of our section and chapters are very active in it. So how is SP deploying the program? Well, I guess first and foremost, the easiest thing is it's on the Energy for Me website. And I think, of course, the idea there is somewhere for our members to go and see the activities and look at the material and stuff so that they can go out. As far as SP itself, though, we've been holding teacher and student workshops at SP events around the globe for quite some time. It actually kind of started at OTC Houston. And now I would say most of our Tier 1 or our flagship events have some sort of Energy for Me activities associated with them. Most of the time, I think you're helping run them. They've we've educated thousands of students and teachers. I think some might estimate 30,000 or so, but it's been quite a few across the world. The other part of this, then, is in 2020 during the pandemic, of course, as SP was trying to pivot into the virtual space and started things like SP live, we also started something called the Energy for Me Ambassador program. And that Ambassador program focused on virtual training for our members. And so we didn't lose momentum on the Energy for Me program. I think we you've estimated that we've probably trained about 1500 members. And we think probably about 20,000 students in their communities have been reached on that program. So that's the key aspect here is I think we have it's a partnership. It's our members accessing the website and doing things in their sections and things. And then there's also SP itself who is deploying it at events. Yeah, I think we've had some really good success with this Ambassador program. A lot of our members are very engaged and want to be a part of it. So are there any opportunities for corporate involvement? What we've talked about is really about members. But what about corporate involvement? Yeah, I think we're just kind of touching the surface of that now. In 2022, we started an Ambassador program for companies. And so the idea was to work collaboratively or engage with various companies, corporate social responsibility groups or whatever they call it at their particular company, and work with them to see if there's ways that we can use the Energy for Me activities to align with their goals. So we've had a few great examples. ExxonMobil, Malaysia and India, they've sponsored an Energy for Me student STEM workshop. They've trained their employees on how to conduct these workshops. It's now an annual event. EOG Resources in Houston. Every year they have a training program with SPE to sponsor and participate in the Spring Break STEM camp in Houston. Aramco's Americas in Houston. They also are the ones who sponsor OTC and ATCE, the STEM program we talked about. We teach a workshop that we talked about before. And then we've done things with SOB, BP, Chevron. So that's like I said, I think that's just getting started. We've got a lot of really good momentum there, but hopefully we can continue to expand that work with companies. Yeah, it's great to get the companies involved because a lot of them are doing something in our communities. So this program makes it easy for them to do outreach. Speaking of that, so what are some of the unique ways our sections and chapters are using the program in their communities? Well, you know, as I go out and I talk to sections and chapters, there's a lot of times I get to hear about some really cool programs. And there are, there's a whole wide range of things out there. The Calgary section, for example, their YPs organize an annual Family Science Day. It's kind of aimed at educating students about oil and gas and putting on fun experiments. And they do a lot of the activities from Energy for Me. And one of them that's really the fan favorite, if you will, is the Fracking with Jell-O experiment. For those that haven't ever seen that, go on Energy for Me and you'll see that. But Calgary section is actually kind of known for that particular experiment. Maybe going down to Ecuador. Ecuador has a real structured Energy for Me program where they're training children and young people in the communities that surround the areas where they operate oil and gas. I mean, 2023 alone, they reached four schools, 2,500 students, 5,000 hours of training and 2,000 hours of volunteering. And then the cool thing is it's not just the members. They're also including the volunteers from the student chapters to help with that as well. So it's a partnership. Moving over to Brazil. Brazil section every year has an award. It's called the Energy for Me Special Award. And it recognizes the students and the YPs that had the best performance in going out and training secondary and elementary students. So that's kind of cool. Last year, I visited the Aberdeen section when I was at Offshore Europe. And they had a really interesting program. Every year, they try to have a workshop at Offshore Europe. And typically, it's been for teachers. This year, they did something for guidance counselors because they saw the guidance counselors are the ones who are really giving advice to the students, high school students, on what to study. So they had this workshop at Offshore Europe where they educated them on our industry and the jobs and the things we do. And it really went well. It was very well received. The Gulf Coast section, they have a high school STEM education tutoring program where they're placing their volunteers in classrooms. I think they've reached three Houston schools last year or over the years. They put in like 80 hours a month. The program's been going on since 2013. So that's pretty neat. KSA section, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, they also have energy education programs. They take elementary and high school students out to visit rock outcrops. So that's kind of neat. And again, it gets the students in a hands-on situation. How about the Oklahoma City section? They have a program now called Engineer for a Day, where they bring in high school juniors and seniors. I think it's actually happening in February, where they're bringing in these high school students and they get to shadow members of our industry for a half day. And then they all come together for a citywide luncheon. And there's others, maybe just a couple more. The Drillbotics program, it's not necessarily an energy program, but the Drillbotics program is an engagement we do at the university level, where we engage university students and teams at the universities where they compete. And they do some really sophisticated things. They have to drill a well into a rock that's been provided to them. And what's really I like about this program, and it's been around for a while, is it doesn't just involve petroleum engineers. They have to work collectively with other disciplines as well. So they bring in a mechanical or electrical or a computer science to solve the problem. It's a huge ambassador program for our industry. And let's not forget, lastly, almost all of our sections give away scholarships on some level. I think last count, and I don't think it's complete, is we gave away like a million dollars overall in 2022. So I think that's all hugely important. Look, every section does something, it seems like. And I could go on and on. But I just think this is where the real effort is going to happen. Like I said before, SP can do one thing, but our members out there in our sections and our student chapters are doing things. So it all has a positive impact on our image. Yeah, you're right. It does. When I hear these stories about what our sections and chapters are doing in the community, I just see the passion that they all have for what they do and they want to share it. So what advice can you give our members to help them get the most out of these programs and why should they participate? Well, let me just thank you for what you just said. When I meet and visit sections and chapters, student chapters, I was there, like I said, in February I was at IPTC and I got to meet the sections and student chapters there. And they're just all super excited about what they're doing, particularly in their outreach. But as far as what members can do, look, I have a couple of things I would recommend. First, as I've mentioned when we talked about the regional sections, make sure you're join your local section because the local section is like we just talked about is where a lot of this stuff's happening in an organized manner. And so join your local section and then look for what their outreach activities are and what they have going on. Just like any other program, they always need volunteers. And many times these outreach programs are limited by the number of volunteers they have. So they may get requests from schools to come in and talk, but we just don't have a volunteer to cover it. So you can have a huge impact just by being involved in your local section. And of course, it leads to professional fulfillment because you get to work together with colleagues and other section members for a common goal. And I think it gives you a lot of leadership training and how to work together and network. The second thing, of course, I think it goes without saying is, I recommend everybody go to the Energy for Me website. Look at what's available. Read about the activities and the tools that are available there. And then maybe start thinking about how are you going to engage your friends and family? And really, those people that you meet every day and just help them understand what our industry does for the world. The positive impact we have on humanity, the cool things we do, the high tech things that we take care of. And most of all, just be proud of who you are and what the impact that we have and what you're doing. And I think that that can be contagious. So I think people would be surprised at the impact they can have, just kind of one person at a time, not just with our industry, but also think about what you can impact on a student's career and future. Yeah, I think you're exactly right. It's the impact. And when we have our young professional members talking to high school students, so that's really, like I said before, that's passion about what they do. So I appreciate you talking about the subject. So what's on tap for me, Terry? May, well, first of all, Paige, thanks again for being a host again. I always enjoy talking to you. But also thank you for running this program. I know that you and your staff put in a lot of time and effort. And I've been at the workshops before at ATC and OTC and things. And I can see the passion in your staff and your team. And it just makes a huge impact. The teachers have a great time. So thank you for that. As far as May goes, I think we're going to talk a little bit more about controlling engineering programs, university collaboration, kind of talk about the academia and the university side of things and kind of where we're headed and what we're seeing and kind of how we impact that. So that's what we'll do in May. And I guess in the meantime, I hope that this is useful and helpful to everybody. And again, I encourage you to go out and engage the public because by doing so, I think ultimately this is how we create our energy future. Thanks, Paige. Thanks, Terry. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the SPE Presidents Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts, on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
SPE Live Podcast: Gaia Talk: COP 28 - Oil and Gas Insights from the Blue Zone,"I'm Asha Robles and this is SPE Talks Tech, managed pressure drilling. Welcome to the SPE podcast. If you haven't subscribed yet, we encourage you to do so. It's a great way to keep up with the latest oil and gas technical trends and valuable information. We're trying something a little new. For this episode, we'll be handing off the interviewing portion to Steve Nass, Regional Wells Manager, Asia Pacific for Wellspec. Steve will be speaking with Mark Arathoon of Petronas and Martin Kolin, Chief Commercial Officer for Kelda Drilling Controls. At the time of this recording in January 2020, the three had just wrapped up SPE's two-day workshop on managed pressure drilling, collaboration towards excellent applications and solutions, which took place in Malaysia. Mark served as a co-chair while both Martin and Steve were committee members. So with that background and introduction, here's Steve Nass coming to us from Kuala Lumpur. Hello, everybody. We've just wrapped up the SPE managed pressure drilling workshop here in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, We're talking to Mark and Martin about the results of this workshop and the advancements in managed pressure drilling technology we've seen, especially with regards to the drilling contractors. Gentlemen, what are your thoughts on that? Well, speaking from an operator's perspective here in Malaysia, I think it's fantastic, first off, to see the advancements that have been presented. I'm really excited. I've been really impressed by all the drilling contractors that have been present at this workshop. And if you compare and look back two years ago to our last workshop, 2017, two and a bit years ago, really we've come on a huge amount. So they've really taken up the challenge and really run with it. And they're obviously very excited about it as well. So I'm very excited to see the developments. Yeah, I think historically, I think when this was first put on the table that contractors, particularly ones in deep water, should start to take more ownership of this drilling process, the comfort level you could see it was palpable. They were not comfortable with this at all because it was entirely something new. It was going to be a paradigm shift. Fast forward three plus years to today, and they are much more comfortable doing that, even considering talking about things about handling influxes with the primary barrier envelope and things like that, whereas before we never even would have touched on that. Yeah, and they've also made huge investments financially to buy the capital equipment and to install it on their rigs. So really, it's amazing. That was a good commentary on the drilling contractors. Let's talk a little bit about the new technology developments in managed pressure drilling that we've seen and talked about over the past two days. I think from Keldo's point of view, from a service company's point of view, what I see is in addition to hardware developments, it's coming down to the controls, which is then leaking into the discussion about automation. What we're actually seeing is that as we need to have the driller more in control of the process, he needs complicated systems that are presented very simply to him as a control so that he is able to not only move pipe up and down and be in control of mechanical movement of drilling equipment, but also pressure control. It's the advancements in the control system side of things that I see, advancements in what we're seeing now. We spent a lot of time talking about that today is that you'll see even earlier, three, four years ago, the majority of actuators that were being used for choke actuation were hydraulic in nature. Now we're seeing almost everyone in the room is talking about electrical actuation. It's the use of electrical actuators not only in deep water, but also on shore that is facilitating the use of more advanced control algorithms. And then that's enabling the driller to take more control more easily. From an operator's perspective, again, all we're interested in is if we're targeting constant bottom-up pressure, that's what we want to see. We want to see it justified. We want to see the models work. We want to see the technology works. So if something doesn't work, then again, we have to find something new. We're looking for accuracy and control, but also simplicity. As you said, we don't want to overload the driller. Absolutely. As a well engineer and an MPD engineer and with the experience in high pressure, high temperature managed pressure drilling wells, I was very much taken by the discussion about influx management, well control, influx management envelope today. And I thought that was an excellent discussion on, you know, how do we make that simpler? How do we make sure the recruiters understand it? How do we make sure the drillers and the drill crew understand what are the limits? What influxes can we detect? What influxes can we take? How do we deal with the influxes and what's required? Thoughts on that? It's interesting how the conversation has turned because previously it would have been very difficult to talk about circulating influxes that were going to be larger than five barrels. And now the acceptance of the calculation methodology that's represented in the influx management envelope or however it wishes to be presented is becoming again, the acceptance is increasing. And so more and more people are recognizing that. The big takeaway that I got from this workshop in particular is that despite the fact that the calculations, the physics behind it are relatively simple, the movement from a traditional MPD operations matrix to now something which is graphical in nature, people in the workshop were saying it's still too complicated. It's too complicated for a driller to comprehend, etc. And so my takeaway from this was, as everybody said, the calculations are very valid and need to be done, but it should be differentiated from an engineering and a planning tool to what actually goes out on the rig in front of the driller. So the driller, not unlike what we were talking about previously, still needs something very simple. He can't be inferring something or trying to plot something on a graph. He needs either an indicator. Is this good or is it bad? I agree completely. And I think it's a fantastic concept, which I think Martin, you pioneered this whole concept. I think it's a fantastic idea, but at the moment, I don't think everyone's of a full enough understanding and appreciation of it. I think the subtleties aren't really understood fully. So I think it almost needs to be boiled down back to the operations style matrix. You can have the IME calculations behind, buried somewhere in a computer, but as long as all it tells you, as you said, is either go or stop kind of a decision. You don't want the driller to be trying to make a difficult decision with all the other pressure that he's got when you've taken an influx. You're listening to the SPE podcast.

There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of comments from the contractors, the joint contractors, the service providers and some of the operators on automation. How do we make it more automated? How do we make sure that crews understand what the systems are doing? We've seen some well-controlled issues around managed pressure drilling where the computer does something and we're not quite understanding what is the computer doing, why is it doing what it's doing. Thoughts on that? I think we've seen before with automation, let's backtrack a little bit, where we're relying on surface back pressure quite often and if you're using a hydrostatically underbalanced mud, then the risk is that at any stage if something goes wrong, you can take an influx. But we also know if you drill on the pressure ramp and you've drilled deeply down the pressure ramp and not realized it and you're not taking the right precautions, then there is still a possibility of taking an influx and no matter what automation you've got, that can still happen. It's a question of whether it responds and whether it responds correctly. I think there's definitely a great benefit from trying to automate the response because we've seen in the past slip-ups between different parts of the rig team, either the MPD team or else the drilling contractor team or the mud logging team on the rig and between them they're pointing fingers at each other and no one's actually managing the bottom hole pressure and stopping the influx. Yeah, I think what we're seeing in some of these more complicated wells, just as you talked about, Mark, is even the visualization is aiding a lot. There's a real-time hydraulics model in some of these rigs that is effectively painting what the annular pressure profile is and then even overlaying what the last step-down test was and what the last formation integrity test was. You're looking at what boundaries that you have so that is starting to at least guide people going that way. I think some of the advancements that we're going to be seeing in those hydraulic models that can now start to act as a digital twin of the well and then with some even reservoir inputs, if you do cross either the fracture gradient or if you're now moving more towards the pore pressure line because it's modeled in this digital twin, it is now the control system is going to be able to offer some sort of an automated response a little bit better. Of course, with the proper validation prior, not just letting it run on its own before being done operationally on the rig. Good. That brings us to, of course, a topic that's close to my heart with training, having done a lot of instruction. Training and competency with the advances in managed pressure drilling, the advances in managed pressure drilling equipment, the advances in managed pressure drilling software. The training and competency C part was discussed at length, not only for managed pressure drilling, but well-controlled training. The training and competency C part was discussed at length, not only for managed pressure drilling, but well-controlled training as well. I think definitely that there's further advances required in that. From an operator perspective, what's your thoughts on that? Training is a very close subject to my heart as well. The training has got to be appropriate, specific. I'll tell you what I was very pleased about from this workshop was several of the drilling contractors were talking about the training that they were doing, and they were saying they were following the specific procedures that they worked on in great detail. I think that's essential. The other important step that they've done, as Martin alluded to, is they're using simulators now to simulate the well and simulate the downhole response, which is another area that I'm still concerned about. That is, we can transfer equipment to the ownership of the drilling contractor. The drilling contractor has all the skills and capability to manage that equipment. That's what they do for a profession, whether it's electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, whatever. They may not have the specific NPD downhole pressure management experience. That's what I'd be interested in seeing how that training is going to develop in the future. Martin, you've done a lot of training. What are your thoughts? Yeah, I guess all three of us can say the same of the fact that training in Commercy is near and dear to our heart. I have been involved with training and specifically NPD training for a number of years. What I see as some of the gaps and was brought up in this workshop is a third party, perhaps accreditation, something to address the minimum training curriculum so that we can level the playing field when it comes to everything. That's the first gap. I know there has been some work that's been done by the IADC to develop a training curriculum in order to address this gap so that this program can be formally rolled out and then either training institutions or drilling companies alike can adopt that and have it vetted by a third party. The other gap that I think we started to speak about a little bit, in particular with things we were talking about already, the fact that we can use managed pressure drilling equipment to handle influxes of an appropriate size, we're now starting to bridge the gap between conventional or rather operations and well control operations. Steve, as you mentioned, we spent some time talking about is anyone engaging the well control community on this? What does this really mean? What competency do people need to have when they're circulating those things out? That second gap I think also needs to be addressed and will be addressed by this new curriculum that's coming out. We have to make sure that despite the level of automation that's there, the specialists that are on site, the people that are in an advisory role, they know what needs to happen with that influx, whether it's acceptable or not. Yeah, and I think that's a good part to end this on. I think the well control people, the well control teams that are out there in the industry need to start linking up with managed pressure drilling. I mean, we're after all managing the pressure while we're drilling. So I think the training, well control, the competency is going to be an important step forward as we move equipment from deeper and deeper waters and higher and higher pressures.

SPE Live Podcast: Sustainable Energy for the Next 50 Years,"You're listening to the SPE podcast. I'm Paige McCowan and today we're talking about the SPE Virtual International Conference and Exhibition on HSC and Sustainability with Francesca Villani. Welcome everyone. Thank you Francesca for joining us today from Denmark. As I mentioned, we are previewing the SPE Virtual International Conference and Exhibition on HSC and Sustainability. It starts the 27th of July. You can still register for the event by going to the SPE events page at spe.org. Francesca, you'll be one of the presenters at the event. Can you tell us a little bit about your background? Yes, thanks. Well, thank you for inviting me to the SPE podcast and to talk about this conference. I mean, we are definitely in unprecedented times. And I am a public health specialist. I've been working in this field for now 20 years or more. And I've been working with pandemic preparedness and response for a very long time. So COVID-19 is clearly on the top of the agenda at this point. So I'm glad that I can attend the conference virtually. Yeah, the conference is going to have to be virtual this year after 25 years or so of this conference. And like you said, with everything going on in the world, I'm sure your industry must have been a roller coaster for the past few months. It has been. I mean, we activated our crisis management team and business continuity plan already in January when the situation was clear in China. And since then, we had to work very much on a daily basis, reassessing priorities and also developing and innovating as we were going along. But it's been a pleasure also to work with the sector, which I think has been among the first responders to the crisis, even before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Right. So let's jump into the conference. Can you tell us a little bit about the conference and why you think it's so important? Yes, well, I would like to, as we're discussing, to put the conference in the context. COVID-19 has been the most wide reaching public health crisis that the world has faced in a long time. Let's say that the last pandemic of this magnitude was over 100 years ago. And the whole oil and gas sector reacted very promptly, as I was mentioning before. And that is in the middle of other crises that the sector is facing. That's not surprising, as of course health and safety are a big concern for the industry. But I think that what COVID-19 made clear for me were two different aspects. One has reinforced the centrality of sustainability and resilience for business. Companies that integrated sustainability and transparency, strategically interbusiness operation prior to COVID-19 crisis, put an even stronger focus on it during the crisis. And I think we're better able to deal with the changes brought about by COVID-19. Additionally, from my perspective as a public health specialist, health, safety and wellbeing became the central to resilience and sustainability discussion in a way that it has never occurred before. We've always thought about health and wellbeing and safety as important, but never really central to the discussion. I think that COVID has changed all of this. So the conference would be absolutely a unique opportunity to all of us professionals to reflect on the changes that the crisis has created. But also on how do we deal with the new normal from the different perspective? And what can be the effort that we can make to recover and rebuild, but in a real sustainable way based on what we have understood? Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SPE programs and activities.

So tell us a little bit about the session your paper is going to be in. Yes, so the session is called Population Health and it's taking place on Tuesday, 28th of July at one o'clock CST time. And it's really my favorite session, of course, is dealing with the way in which government companies and communities can work together to improve human health. And is making again population health becoming more central to the whole discussion about the sector, but also highlighting the importance of partnership. And making clear that, you know, we cannot talk about population health and sustainability unless we work on these issues together. So it's a great session. Yeah, it sounds like it. Now in your paper specifically, you discuss the health impacts from extraction projects, in this case coal mining. So it's the impacts on the local community and how important it is for sustainability. Can you give us some highlights from your paper and the research behind it? Sure. I mean, I am a health impact assessment specialist. I've been working in impact assessment for a long time, collaborating with all other sectors. And one of the aspects that has always bothered me quite a lot is the fact that health impact assessment is the worst performing health performance indicators for the sector. And this if we look at the data from IOGP, so this comes from the companies themselves. The health committee of IOGP decided to therefore update the HIA guidelines and we did it just recently in 2016. And it's publicly available. I encourage everybody to read it. This has improved a little bit the performance of this indicator, but it's still lagging behind against if we compare it with other indicators. So I looked with some colleagues at how health is included in impact assessment in coal mining projects in Australia. This is because, of course, coal mining in Australia is one of the biggest sectors. So if we could identify excellence, we thought that this was the place to look. And what we found out looking at document, but also talking with different stakeholders, was that in reality health and well-being and equity were not properly included in the impact assessment. Maybe the topic was mentioned, but the impacts were not really assessed. And if you don't assess them, then you're not going to manage them. And this has created a lot of problem for the industry in Australia with court rulings that stop project exactly because human health was not taken in consideration, as well as a lot of conflict between communities, companies and other stakeholders. So we thought that this would be an important dimension to look and something to learn from another sector and to bring it to the conference for the company to reflect upon. Oh, yeah. That, like I said, I keep saying it's so timely what you're talking about. One of the important elements I thought, looking at your paper, is actually the definition of health. It's not just the absence of disease or talking about hospital. It really sets the premise of your paper. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? Well, thanks very much for the questions. I really love it. And the fact that you mentioned that it's not only about hospital, which is really sometimes a misunderstanding. People, when we talk about health, think about disease or medical care or hospitals. Well, you know, if you get sick, it's exactly because you are not healthy. So health, as defined by the World Health Organization in 1946, is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. So health is a positive concept and is also an enabling factor. If we think about sustainability, the Sustainable Development Goal Number Three aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. So health and well-being become both a prerequisite for sustainable development as well as the result of it. And as we mentioned before about the session on population health, again, health status is a combination of collective responsibility because there are so many factors that can influence the health status of population. Is the water they drink? Is the way they go to work? Are they conditioned in the workplace? Is the house where they live? So the SDG Free is connected with all the other sustainable development goals. They are closely interlinked. And that's why, you know, any project that can claim to be sustainable for me has to improve SDG Free and all its target in the communities where the project is located. This is the ultimate, ultimate proof of sustainability because it means they have been able to improve all the other sustainable development goals as well. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

So we talked a little bit about the COVID-19 crisis. How do you see it changing the role of sustain or it maybe even improving the role of sustainability for organizations? COVID-19 for me has proved, you know, some of the challenges that I was mentioning in the paper, especially for the industry. First, there is no fence. You can't separate workers from community or, you know, projects from the local context because whatever it happens, happens to everybody. So we need to have a much more in-depth understanding of where project and activities are located. The second is that everybody has a responsibility for health. It's not just the medical department or it's not just someone within a company. It has to be the responsibility of everybody. And it's the same thing we mentioned at the beginning. We work with departments across all companies during the COVID. When, for example, half of your workforce in the office work from home, you change the concept of what is a workplace. Suddenly workplace became a very fuzzy type of concept. So you need to work. You know, it's becoming responsibility of everybody. Third is that we still have the tendency to do assessment project by project, but we don't look at the cumulative impacts generated by the sector as such in a country. So companies need to be better able to work together and to work together as a sector with the government to look very much at the opportunities for sustainability. And finally, as I mentioned at the beginning, companies that were looking at sustainability before the crisis were better ready for managing the crisis. So companies should be more transparent about the way they assess their impact on the communities and be better able at managing them, developing real partnership. For me, I would like to read in the future reports the way that the organization responded to this crisis, to any other crisis, not focusing exclusively on the workforce, but also more broadly on the supply chain, the customer and the public. And emphasizes the areas where they went above and beyond the legal compliance, really thinking in more strategic and future terms. And also, you know, what have we learned from this crisis that will make us better able to deal with, you know, with either a second wave of COVID or with another crisis that surely will arrive? Yeah, I think there's a lot of lessons learned for the future on this. And I can imagine that the next HSC and sustainability conference will be full of COVID papers and discussions. Probably yes. Probably yes. On the 30th of July at 8 a.m. Central Time, tune in with Sashi Gunturu and learn about subsurface data engineering. Join us for this great learning experience by visiting energyanddata.org to register now. The Energy and Data webinars are powered by AAPG, SEG, and SPE. So Francesca, as we said, the SPE virtual international conference and exhibition on HSC and sustainability starts July 27th. And again, this is going to be a virtual conference. What can people expect of it being virtually? Yeah, so it's going to be a new conference, a new way to participate to conferences. Some of the events will be live, but a lot of the other, like my session, is going to be with a prerecorded presentation. However, all of us, four presenters, are going to be attending the question and answer session at the end. So I still hope we are going to have a very lively debate and the possibility to exchange, probably even in a more constructed way, because maybe working and doing it from home, we have more time to interact in a different way. Although we miss not being able to visit Bogota this time. Yes, the travel is the one thing and then also the networking. But hopefully, like you said, there'll be great interaction with the Q&A and people will be able to, you know, discuss further, which is one of the big draws from a conference like this. Yeah, I think that the participants will need to look, you know, to be we need to be better prepared this time. We need to have a look at the program and knowing in advance where we want to engage, because yes, the casual networking will not be an option this time. Hopefully the next one. Yes, hopefully the next one. Well, thank you, Francesca, for your time today. And if you want to hear more about Francesca's paper, you can still register for HSC at spe.org events. Thanks, Paige.

SPE Live Podcast: Leveraging Expertise to Prepare the Next Generation,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live maximizing utilization of subsea well intervention equipment. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on June 12th, 2024. Welcome to SPE live. Today we'll be talking about maximizing utilization of subsea well intervention equipment. My name is Billy Pierce. I'm the senior account manager here at Gilmore Technologies in Houston. And I'll be your moderator today. Today's SPE live is going to be right at about 30 minutes. And we want to encourage you to ask questions throughout the throughout the show, throughout the presentation. Fill them in there in the comments and we'll absolutely get to them, whether it's during the conversation or at the end. Before we get started, I do want to invite each and every one of you watching and attending today to attend the SPE well intervention, the subsea well intervention symposium, August 13th through the 15th this year in Galveston, Texas. We've been putting on this symposium for some years now as something I'm very proud and excited to be a part of. It gives you the opportunity to really immerse yourself in a unique industry journey through high pressure, high temperature solutions, cutting edge riser lift light well intervention techniques and the latest plug in abandonment campaign strategies for decommissioning and putting those wells to bed when they're done. All within an overarching theme this year. The overarching theme this year is rapidly unlocking value in an energy transition world. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guests for this SPE live. Our first guest is going to be Jack Sanford. Jack Sanford is a professional engineer with over 34 years of experience in all disciplines of oil and gas in the E&P sector. Currently, Jack is a senior advisor at Talos Energy. Prior to Talos, he was the director of drilling and completion and DWD&C manager at Quarter North. Before joining Quarter North, he worked for multiple companies as a consulting engineer, including Noble, ENI, Exxon, and Amaco. He's published over 15 technical papers and presented multiple industry symposiums. He has a master's degree in petroleum engineering, an undergrad in both petroleum engineering and geology, all from Texas A&M. Our second guest today is going to be Agnaldo Magnum. Agnaldo is currently the implementer of drilling rig technologies at Petrobras. Agnaldo holds a master's degree in electrical engineering from UFPE Brazil and an MBA in business intelligence from PUC Rio, both in Brazil. He has over 14 years of experience and has worked as a rig maintenance engineer at Petrobras, their self-owned offshore drilling rigs, as an inspector of offshore contractor drilling rigs, and as a coordinator responsible for Petrobras-owned platform rigs and all their planned maintenance stops. Jack and Agnaldo, welcome to SPE Live. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Billy. You're very welcome. Thank you both for being here. I really appreciate you all taking time both to write the papers and the content and to do the wonderful work that you've done within our industry and sharing it with us here this morning. Thank you so very much. So let's jump right into it, y'all. Both of you have done some pretty impressive work in the industry, in our sector, and it's stuff that we'd love to highlight leading into the symposium and just share with folks here at SPE Live. So, Jack, you did a bunch of very interesting work changing the way that we configure rigs during flowbacks, for flowbacks, in order to get more out of the fluids that we use during workovers and interventions. Can you tell us a little bit about the kind of work that you did there? Yeah, let's go ahead and move to slide one. I want to start off first by acknowledging my co-authors there. Dylan Bodden and Brandon Prudham, because they really made this possible for us when we tried this. And what this is, is an additional flowback equipment. It's equipment that we added behind our well-tested equipment that allowed us to reuse the process equipment and try to identify four key objectives. I mean, what we did, we were trying to minimize the environmental impact, maximize operational efficiency by reclaiming and reusing fluid. But we want to do this when we reduce the overall cost. I mean, and sometimes you have to spend a little money to make a little money. So that's what we tried to do and then prove up this new technology in deep water environment. So this is a P&ID and it shows its four major components. We have a centrifuge that allows us to spin out the oil and water. We have it first goes through a processing or a gas buster, then it goes through the centrifuge. Then we have a second stage where we use a zeolite component, which really just pulls the oil away and allows us to split the water out. And then finally, a carbon vessel that allows it to polish it to allow us to discharge overboard. So that's the system we have. What this is about is a case history. We tried this on four different types of wells. Four different types. Yes, sir. If you go to the next slide, I can show what we have. And you can see the four wells listed across the top and some of the things that we were able to do. We tried to prove up the technology on just a simple safety valve work over change. And this was these are all really major wells. Each one of these wells. I think the first well was the shallowest, was only 25,000 feet, was only 25,000 feet. Only. Yes, only. And the next three were 27 to 30,000 feet in depth and very high pressures. So we did a safety valve work over. Then we did a cold tubing stimulation. You can see there at the bottom kind of the cost benefit. We really saw some benefits for the system there. On an initial completion, we were able to do the flow back and then again, minimize the environmental impact and maximize the operational. But probably the biggest one and these kind of make the best papers is when there's a major train wreck, this is when you see the benefit of having this system available. And that's right. What's what is the difference? So it's putting in a second flow back system. That's right. To give. So you've got more footprint. It's going to take up necessarily more space. What's the difference between this kind of system and the type of systems that we've sort of grown up seeing out there on the rigs? Typically, you you do a two or three stage separation through regular well test equipment. And that goes to a storage tank and you either pump it off to a vessel. We're able to take the fluids that are still in two phase, the oil and completion brine or oil and water and separate it out and pull the oil out that allows the fluid to be discharged overboard or allow the fluids to be reused. So obviously, you don't want to pump back completion brine with any hydrocarbons and then pump the pump it back down hole. So that's where we saw the benefit in like the cold tubing operations as we could reuse the fluids. And then also in the fourth well where we had the major issues where we had to recirculate the riser three times, then we had to put cold tubing on it. And in those situations, we were able to reuse three to four thousand barrels of zinc bromide, which is very expensive fluid. Very expensive. Absolutely. So was there a was there a problem that you observed that this was the solution that you were looking for? What sort of problems presented themselves or challenges presented themselves that made you take this kind of an action? Because this is this is fairly it's almost counterintuitive. You wouldn't think that it's more efficient to use more equipment. Well, it started out with. You have high disposal costs in deep water, and when you're flowing back the well and you're getting seven thousand barrels of oil back to the platform and putting on a flow vessel, you would actually like to get some money for that. But it takes a certain requirement in the oil and the water. So you're either having to pay for disposal or you could actually get paid for the oil. And you don't want to have to pay for disposal of some of the brines if you can clean them and clean them up enough and hit the regulatory regulatory requirements and discharge it overboard. So both of those were able to be achieved with this system, which allowed us to reuse fluid and minimize the amount of disposal that we have to do. And at the end, so it started off as that. And then we saw the benefits when you run into major MPT events. I mean, probably the best thing to do is you go ahead to our last slide. It kind of talks about the results is basically we were able to achieve everything we proved up the system. We did minimize the environmental impact by we didn't have to dispose of a lot. We were able to maximize the efficiency because the zinc bromide is over a thousand dollars a barrel. If I'm having to buy new fluid instead of reusing, we were able to reuse about three thousand barrels of fluid for an extended time period. And you see there I have listed there's about ten thousand barrels of fluid we reuse. Well, that would have been ten million dollars. I mean, so there's very few items that you can identify that can save you ten million dollars in operation. So it's more than paid for itself. Let's talk about that zinc for a minute. Now, you think bromide is expensive. But when you're using it, it's because you've got a situation where your well or something down there is quite powerful and you really need that fluid weight to be that primary means of well control. Did it take a lot to get buy in from your partners and regulators to reuse to basically use used fluid? Was there was there any hesitance to say, yeah, I'll take some used zinc bromide, please? No, it's the work over fluids are pretty normal for operations. You have to have a kill weight fluid or sometimes you can do it as an under balanced fluid like cold tubing operations. But it's fairly common. It's just more of a company deciding it's like I'm going to reuse this fluid and it won't damage the formation. So the worst thing you can do is damage the completion you got. You're trying to keep that from happening. But you want to optimize the efficiency associated with it. So the regulatory issue was this is equipment that's there. Well, test equipment has to be stamped and approved by the government. We this is downstream of that. And it wasn't required to get stamped. But we did get it stamped and approved by the government for operation. So you went above and beyond the regulatory requirements. Did you get any feedback from partners or regulators about the innovative approach? I mean, obviously, partners love it when you're saving them ten million dollars. So it makes it really easy feedback to start, though. It was like, why do you want to spend the extra money? It's kind of like belt suspenders. It was great insurance. It more than paid for itself on the norm on the normal wells. But that train wreck well is the one that you really saw the benefit of. What went wrong there, Jack? Or what was the challenge that you guys managed to overcome on that train wreck? Well, there were lots of things associated with that. I mean, it's like, you know how that goes. Once you have one problem, it goes to the next one. We had a crown plug release in the well and we actually got oil in the riser, which is a large volume riser, and we had to circulate the riser clean with zinc bromide. If we had not been able to filter the oil out of it, we would have had we did that three times. Well, that's six thousand barrels. That's six million dollars by itself. That's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot. And the process of doing that is not quick. You're paying for rig time. You're paying for the opportunity cost and whatever else you were you were getting ready to do that's not getting done. Yeah, there's a there's a lot that goes in there. Never mind the additional dangers to the environment and personnel and everything else. That's a that's a pretty big deal. Congratulations. Again, just counterintuitive. But you know, proof that the the the answer isn't always the obvious answer. That's very, very well done. I'd like to say howdy to folks in the audience from from Houston and from Saudi Arabia. It's great to see folks logging on to hear this kind of approach. We encourage you to go ahead and ask questions or put your comments in the chat and we'll absolutely get to them. We'd love to hear from you all. If there's stuff that that you'd like to know, absolutely we'll revisit stuff. So go ahead and put the questions or your comments in the chat. Next up, let's talk to Agnardo. Agnardo, how are you doing, man? I'm great. So you have been facing a different kind of challenge. Jack's loading more equipment on to on the vessels. You've been having trouble finding vessels. Yeah, yeah, we have been trouble finding vessel using our vessel to do our job because we have a lot of jobs to be done in shallow waters. And they have nowadays we just have a DP rigs, right? It's more easy to find DP rigs in Brazil. We just have one anchored rig because it's a lot of cost to adapt the rigs to work in Brazil. So we just have one rig. We can put this slide on live. Yeah, I tried to explain. We have created the charts to to help our internal clients to understand what is the what is the opportunities of your fleet. What do we have? What do you have in your fleet? So the right side, we have three categories to separate the rigs themselves. So we still have anchored rigs. We can use this a lot for shallow water. And you have two types. We have two types of DP rigs, right? We have a high specification, there are low specification rigs. It's it's mostly DP2 or DP3 rigs. It's almost that. It's not exactly like that, but it's almost that. It's a more capable propulsion system and a less capable propulsion system rigs. So we use this kind of of chart to better indicate for the project what do we have and what you can use this way. We can consider the inventory of your toolbox, if you will. Yeah, yeah, we have a huge toolbox and you can help the clients to choose what box is more adequate to do the job. In the left side, we have the vessels, the specialized vessel, light to air intervention vessel, right? And you have a plus, double plus, triple plus. There is a difference between the two of them. For us, we have a high-based vessels. Yes, high-based affirmation and high-less operation. Here in Petrobras, we have been using the LWIV triple plus for almost seven years. We have been done several jobs in this kind of vessel. Now we try to put new technology to help us to retrieve the tubing. Now we want to be able to rotate the tubing even with this kind of vessel. So we have been working this kind of vessel. We still are looking for higher, putting your fleet a rise-alive vessel. We have a tender last month, two months ago, but we still are looking for this kind of vessel. We have some problems to bring this kind of vessel in your fleet. The whole world is seeing this kind of thing. We are all looking for assets in our regions. There is just a limited number of vessel assets out there. There has been a trend for the past several years to only build those top-spec, big, DP, drill-ship style vessels to maximize the rate of return. But not every project needs a generation 17, 30,000 foot of water drill-ship. We have wells to abandon that were built in the 80s. So it's a small, small... You cannot put a huge BOP inside, above this kind of wells. Sometimes it's like trying to hang a picture with a sledgehammer when you just need the right tool for the right job. So what kind of planning work did you do to prepare for this, to re-appropriate or reassign vessels, whether they were in your fleet, company-owned or contracted, to doing different kinds of work and reconfiguring them? What kind of planning work led up to this? Yeah, we tried to bring the project before, right? We tried to approach the project from the beginning in understanding what challenges do we have in this kind of project. What challenges do we have in every type of wells and try to put technology or new ways to do this job. We have been working with Tetra-BOP, we have been working with reduced time for EDS with new technology. We have tried to bring new technology in new ways, even the real-time high analysis that will enable us to understand the scenario that are happening in the rigs in real time. Not only in an off-sea analysis. That's right. There was a time when all of that situational analysis had to be done on the rig by the well site leader or the company man and the OIM making decisions out there kind of unaided. Today, we have wonderful communications in place. We have real-time data that is being streamed and sent back to the beach. We have literally global support. You can get support from engineers who are there in the office in Rio, Houston, Dubai, and the world. Those kinds of capabilities absolutely help us as an industry. Which of those capabilities did you lean on the most in order to sort of because I want to emphasize that changing the methodology of how we use existing tools is technology. Methodology is technology. Technology is not just new widgets, new tools. It is reconfiguring what we currently have and using it in a new and innovative way. That is absolutely technology innovation. What steps did you all take and what tools did you reconfigure and reuse in order to get better results down there? We used a lot of old school technology, old school equipment. We have used such anchored. We have used that already. It is like a cable. You put cable in and stick up the cable. We have been using also, we tried, for example, to allow the rotation in the triple plus light to well intervention vessel. We tried to use the power swivel. Even the power swivel is on our toolbox to use it in other ways with a new way to see a new use for this kind of equipment. So we tried to look at new ways to do things even with the old equipment. It is a good phrase that you say about the technology because every time I say that I work with the Riggs technologies, everyone asks for me, oh, so now you build a new Riggs adaptive for this kind of job. You want to build a new Riggs and try to do a new project for this kind of job. That is not it. Instead of building a new Riggs, we are just going to change the way we configure our existing Riggs and our existing vessel to get more out of what we already have available. Now, did you see through this, did you see pushback from colleagues or partners? Because not everything is run completely by Petrobras down there. You have a lot of other operator partners, both international and local, as well as the regulating body down there, which is separate from Petrobras. Did you get any pushback or concerns from partners or regulators when you were saying, hey, we can absolutely do a riser job off of this vessel or we can take this vessel and do a riserless intervention? Did you get pushback or concerns? It's not always easy to put new ways to do the job. It's not easy. It's not that easy. You can always have to talk a lot, present a lot and discuss a lot. The regulator, it's always, I have to say that regulators are open to talk, but it's not always to listen, right? So what we have been doing with the regulator is try to anticipate the discussion. So we looking for bringing a new way to do or bring a new technology to do the job. We try to anticipate this discussion with the regulator. We have been trying to talk very soon with the, about the problem and address all concerns that we put on the table and to do a robust risk assessment to try to convince them that we are in the right path. We are doing a different job in a different way, but we are evaluating our risk and making sure that you're not losing something by losing efficiency, losing safety or anything like that. Great question from the audience here. What specific methods have been successful in increasing the versatility of intervention equipment for your companies? What methods have been successful at increasing that versatility? Yeah, we have been working a lot in trying to put, in collecting data. So this kind of data is, have been used to better understand our scenarios and to take better decisions right on time. We have been using this kind of data a lot to do, to make you anticipate some problems when you have the rush environment scenarios, we have been taking decisions before it's happening. You know, so beyond that, we also have using, also reducing effort in the well head. That's method and we have discussed a lot with projects to make this possible. I think that's the main method that we have been using to achieve this. Another great question from the audience. Jack, why don't you try this one? Beyond the equipment itself, are there any collaborative strategies between operators and service companies that can further improve those utilization rates? Are there ways to collaborate between companies, between stakeholders to increase that utilization and that versatility? Yeah, associated with this, we obviously do this a lot. I mean, it's not associated with what the presentation I gave, but like we will work with the different operators with looking at the different vessels that are available. And when we do interventions and trying to choose the right tool for the right project. And sometimes that's difficult because not all the vessels are available, at least in our arena in the Gulf of Mexico. So it is a 100% a collaboration between, hey, who has this vessel next? Where is it going to be used? And how do you manage the services on that vessel to make sure that you're successful? That's right. I imagine once you've got all that equipment on the vessel, if you can leave it there or at least minimize how much of it you have to take off in between projects, in between runs, it would definitely help everyone involved, both from a safety, environmental and cost perspective, just an efficiency overall perspective. If you can leave some of that stuff installed or at least leave the weld down plates installed. Another great question from the audience, Jack, do you see this new flow back practice being utilized and beneficial in international work? Or do you think that this is unique to the Gulf of Mexico? I mean, actually, it's probably more beneficial in international work because companies weld test in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, the benefit of the system that we used is you never know when you're going to use it. And I kind of had a flow diagram on there. It's like, basically, I think it's useful in any way. Now, some of the international work is expensive brines where you really see a benefit. But anywhere you can have NPT and reuse fluid, which is every well everywhere, it is beneficial. It may you may think you're spending more money up front, but you never know when you're going to have problems. And when you have problems, it more than pays for itself. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Spending a little more upfront and absolutely getting an extremely useful set of tools in your offshore toolbox. And yeah, I agree. Any region that uses, you know, customer special or just high spec fluids would benefit from this kind of methodology. Folks, I want to wrap this up. I want to thank everyone for their time and for the amazing work that you all put into these projects and for sharing this with us. Again, this both of these go to the core theme that the industry, our intervention industry is looking at right now. And that is optimizing efficiency and optimizing the way that we do interventions. The best place to find oil is still in an oil well. And there's something wonderful about fixing broken wells and optimizing performing wells to get the absolute most out of them for our stakeholders and for our communities. And I want to applaud both of you for the work that you've done in these areas. And I want to invite both of you and everyone else to come to Galveston, Texas in August the 13th through the 15th at the Galveston Island Convention Center. We'll be putting on the Well Intervention Symposium again this year. I'm excited to be a moderator and a panel and a member of the committee. And I think there's a lot of really valuable stories to be told down there. And I look forward to seeing all of y'all in Galveston. Thanks for listening to the SPE Live Podcast.

SPE Live Podcast: Gaia Talk ‚Äì Rigs to Reefs: From Oil Production to Ocean Habitat,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live Energy Influencers View, growth of reservoir engineering for CCS and hydrogen storage. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on September 27th, 2023. And now your moderator, Mani Bansal. Welcome to the SPE Live Energy Influencers View, growth of reservoir engineering for CCS and hydrogen storage. My name is Mani Bansal, Lead Quantum Creative for NextInEnergy and SPE The Way Ahead, and the session chairperson for SPE ECP Committee for ATC2023. I hold six years of experience as a reservoir engineer, and I'm currently working as a tech specialist RE at Shell India. It is indeed a pleasure for me to be your moderator today. Today, SPE Live, the last 30 minutes, we encourage you to ask questions throughout the event, which will be taken up by our influencers towards the end of our session. We are excited to host three 2023 energy influencers selected by The Way Ahead for outstanding technical, entrepreneurial, and service contributions by young professionals. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest, Abhijit Suboyan. Abhijit Suboyan is the environment lead sustainability specialist at Digital Energy, where he holds a distinguished record of contributions in emission reduction, sustainable strategies, and process optimization. Abhijit holds a master's degree in petroleum engineering from Khalifa University and a B.E. in petroleum engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University, currently MIT WPU. Currently Abhijit is co-creating a platform using advanced digital technologies to establish a Koulos Loop recycling system from steel for decommissioned offshore assets. Next we have is Choja Ojanabre, a reservoir engineer at the Nigerian Egypt Oil Company, NAOC, specializing in reservoir simulation, estimations and forecasting, reduction optimization, and data analytics. Choja holds a bachelor's in mechanical engineering from the University of Fort Hudson, Nigeria, a master's in advanced mechanical engineering from Cranfield University, UK, and a master's in petroleum engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, and indeed an MBA from the University of Fort Hartcote Business School. We also have Oganre Ogolo, a senior staff trainee at the Petroleum Training Institute and was formerly a lecturer in the Department of Petroleum and Gas Engineering, Nile University of Nigeria. He has two parents in drilling engineering and three co-operates in petroleum economics and is responsible for developing a novel method to improve the rheological properties of low-swelling bentonite clay. He holds a bachelor's in petroleum engineering from the University of Benin and a master's in petroleum engineering from the African University of Science and Technology. Oganre Ome Choja Abhijit, welcome to the SEL. The energy sector faces a serious challenge to reduce the greenhouse emissions required by both producers and consumers of energy. The journey for this transformation will be significantly aided by the advancements in technology such as batteries, hydrogen, carbon capture, and modern bioenergy, along with rapidly falling renewable energy prices. Let's begin our conversation and explore the different faces of this area. Starting off with you Abhijit, as my first question is related to your experience working towards advancement of digital tech for decommissioned assets in the offshore. So Abhijit, how do you think that the advancements in technology will aid the energy industry to accelerate its journey towards CCUS or even hydrogen? Over to you Abhijit. That is an excellent question to get us started, Mani. So thank you for that. So I personally believe that the rapid advancement of technology is truly reshaping our energy landscape. Now specifically for CCUS, we're seeing innovations like AI-powered monitoring systems, advanced membrane technologies that are enhancing capture efficiencies. These technologies don't just improve current methods, they potentially lower costs and CCUS more scalable. And for me, this is huge. Now as for hydrogen, there are breakthroughs in electrolysis and storage solutions that are accelerating with adoption. Now with the merging of digitalization and renewable energy sources, we are also able to produce green hydrogen more efficiently. So ultimately, I believe that as technology continues to advance, the barriers for both CCUS and hydrogen can be significantly reduced and this can pave the way forward for more widespread adoption. Now I'd also like to add that in the context of offshore decommissioned assets, digital technology has become a game changer. So with things like digital twin technologies, data analytics, artificial intelligence and automation that are revolutionizing the landscape right now, handling of such assets has become much, much more simpler because these tools not only facilitate efficiency and cost-effective assessment, they can also help you manage these assets through tracking and tracing, which paves the way for a viable, repurposing solution. That is what the energy industry is also looking for. And this can scale across multiple operations, across the entire energy chain. Hence, the integration of these digital technologies I feel is crucial for enhancing sustainability, for reducing our emissions, and then presenting a promising pathway for our future. Great. Thanks, Abhijit. I agree with you that sustainability and technology should go hand in hand and definitely we see a lot of improvements there. My next question is to you, Ogen Rume. What changes and additional resources you think should the academia bring in the reservoir engineering courses to track the bright future, to prepare them for projects related to CCUS and hydrogen? Over to you. Okay. Thank you, Mani, for the question. Well, for reservoir engineering curriculum, as a result of the emergence of CCS technology, I think that the reservoir engineering curriculum need to be redesigned to to cover such concepts because today we're talking about carbon capture. And one of the ways we can use to achieve that is also by looking at storage sites where this carbon has been captured can be stored. And there's no way you want to store carbon without you looking at the possibilities of storing this carbon in reservoirs, either depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or sialine aquifers. So reservoir engineering courses or programs need to be redesigned to look at, to contain more studies of these depleted reservoirs on how they could be used as storage sites for CO2 and also storage sites for hydrogen as well. Then why I really find this question very interesting because I know that for most reservoir engineering programs, the emphasis most times is on the oil reservoir, it's on the gas reservoir. So that's where most studies have been done. But with the advent of CCS technology and the advent of the need that we need to store CO2 in reservoirs, that would make it possible now for us to redesign reservoir engineering to be able to capture more information about the aquifer. Then I also said that for, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think that's my comment for that. Then also to, I also suggest that for petroleum engineering program in general, there is need to redesign them to capture these new technologies that we're looking at. Because for many petroleum engineering, who will still go there, all you find is the conventional petroleum engineering knowledge. That's where I was working before at Nile University of Nigeria. When we looked at some of these things, we had to introduce a course which we termed special topics. So in that course, we try to bring our students to the limelight of the industries, which we are talking about now. Luckily, I was the one taking the course. And sometimes after the course, I see how excited, how knowledgeable, and how skilful my students were. And I appreciate that the need for us to really add that course as part of our program. So thank you. Great. Thanks, Ogana Rume. So I completely agree with your point, as you said, that it's a pressing need for the revamping of the curriculum specifically to incorporate these technologies and amalgamate them along with the curricula so that the young people can learn lots from them. So moving on next to Choja, this question for you is, we know that CCUS is recognized as a necessary and relatively low-risk piece of the decarbonization puzzle. To me, the net zero emission targets and startups are playing a critical role in driving innovation and commercialization of CCUS technologies. But what I see is that the technology is not moving fast enough to achieve a 1.5 degree or even 2 degree potential pathway. So Choja, can you share some reflections on the current status in Nigeria at your end? So over to you. All right. Thank you very much, Mani, for that question. First of all, I would want to agree with you that globally, CCUS and other technologies, they are not progressing at a pace that most climate enthusiasts the world over would have loved to see it move. Okay? Because just if you take a quick look at the IEA's World Energy Outlook, you see that there's a huge gap as in the delta between global ambition and implementation. That's considering that there are differences in the different scenarios, as I mean, the stated policy scenarios, the announced pledging scenarios, and then net zero, as in where we want to be by 2050 at about, say, 1.5 degrees, sorry, beyond the industrial temperatures. So coming to Nigeria, just like you have rightly asked, the contributions of startups, they have to be understood by considering the specific socio-economic and developmental context of the country, okay, that's within the region where we find ourselves. So there's actually a huge potential for CCUS here, no doubt. But so far, the focus has been on harnessing a cleaner source of fuel, as in which is natural gas, for which Nigeria has an abundance. In fact, the government has declared these decades to be the decade of gas. So that has been a mantra in the industry currently. And thus, I will say that we'll explain why there is the absence of a complete or comprehensive legal framework for CCUS technologies. And hence, why we have a handful of startups that would want to enter this space without these frameworks in place, and the government supporting these frameworks, most of them have challenges here with accessing capital to fund their ideas. Because CCUS is a capital intensive venture. So what I would say is that the focus for most of the majority of startups here in Nigeria is on the renewables themselves, such as PV, that's solar. And I would be expecting to see as a change in this in the near future, because from my recent interactions with some of the regulators, we see that there's a growing interest here on the CCUS stage, and that they are even talking to set up a pilot system. So that is where we are currently around my region. Thank you, Manu. Great, great. Thanks, Choja. It's good to see that there's a bit of improvement there in terms of the startup culture specifically related to CCUS in Nigeria. So good to see that. And I also see the similar footprint happening globally across where a lot of funding have been supported by the government and different institutions when it comes to the startup or related to the CCUS and indeed hydrogen as well. So this is for the audience. Please make sure you submit your questions in the comment tab and the chat box. We are continuing further with the discussion, but please make sure that you for your questions to be answered. It's important that it's based in the comment box as well. So coming again to you, Choja. So what do you think is the oil and gas industry looking wide enough for venues to capture the carbon or their focus is still on inducting the technology that doesn't really impact their cash flow? So any viewpoint for you, Choja? And then I'll move on to the others as well to share their opinion. Over to you, Choja. All right. Thank you, Manu. I would say yes. Yeah, I would say yes that because the evidence amounts that there's been an increased spending on CCUS. Okay. We see companies are committing billions of dollars into projects over the next five years. Okay. We've also seen increased spending on R&D by most of the industry players. And there have been a lot of synergies or collaborations here between the industry and then the academia or our research institutions. We're also seeing increased diverse approaches, okay, such as the adoption of newer technologies like the direct air capture as you know, CO2 from ambient air. We see the bioenergy CCUS projects that are coming up. And of course, yeah, there's also increased use of blue hydrogen. I mean, blue hydrogen production. So yet, with the world's energy demands here at the highest levels, I think the industry would need to continue meeting today's challenges here with the eyes on tomorrow. That is to say they have to strike, companies have to strike a balance, okay, by meeting demands in such a way that they will still be around tomorrow, okay, to address tomorrow's challenges. So to me, I think it's not just lip service here from the companies because the industry is following its word, matching it with action, they are putting money on the table. However, we need to still see marked commitments from governments here at the world over. And like I had mentioned earlier, there's still a huge delta between, okay, that's the ambition as in where we want to be and where we currently are. So we need to see much of alignment by having policies that are in place and that are being matched by action, both from the industry and then from the government side of things. Thank you. I second you Choja on that. Others, please feel free to chime in. Abhijit or Ogunrume, what's your take on this? What do you think? Where are we in the technology and technology? So I personally believe as somebody who's been in the sustainability space that sustainability also goes hand in hand with economic viability. Right. So what I mean by that is a lot of times and a lot of the technology that you're seeing eventually becomes a necessity. And I feel that the public, the private sector, including academia, are collaborating like never before in the current zone that we're in. So when it comes to the wider focus of, you know, let's say technology induction or the risk of carbon capture, we've seen these energy companies investing significantly. And there has been a lot of technological advancements that will become a game changer eventually. So that's just my two comments there. My colleague had already given a very good, solid response. And I will also go back to this later on when the audience comes in as well. Hey, thanks. Thanks, Abhijit. Ogendrumme, you have any points to add to Abhijit's comments? Yeah, just to contribute to that, because the industry is really making lots of efforts to see how we can capture carbon, use it or store it. Also, because even most of the times you want to go to the bank to get you money or to borrow you money to fund the 4C4 projects. Most of the times the banks require you to, they want to also see your plans on how you will be able to reduce the emission of CO2. So most cases they want to see your ESG component as part of your investment plan. So the industry is really looking deeply on CCS technologies and also the use of other alternative forms of energy. So this is just what I want to add to the response that has been given to us. Great. Great. Great, Ogendrumme. As Abhijit pointed, I see that a drastic change that has happened from, I believe, from the point when I really started in this industry. And what I see now, there's been a huge investment in the technology induction. And the companies are really focusing on that direction. Moving on next to you for the next question. Let's shift gears now to talk about the fuel of the future, which is hydrogen. And what potential do you think hydrogen holds to meet the net zero emission goal? What is happening in the space around you? So I'll start off with you, Abhijit, and then the others can feel free to chime in. So over to you, Abhijit. Another excellent question, Mani. Thank you for that. So personally, I believe hydrogen has tremendous potential, especially as a clean energy resource. Now, for me, the beauty of it is that it can be produced from various sources. It can be stored and transported over long distances, and then you can consume it for various applications, all the way from power generation to transportation. And the only byproduct that we have is nothing but water. So as we transition or as we go ahead in this path for net zero, hydrogen to me can be a game changer. And especially in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize just by electrification alone. So in my region, I'm witnessing a huge surge of investments, and talks especially about hydrogen. There's been several pilot projects, especially related to green hydrogen production, fuel cell vehicles globally, and especially in the Middle East. And as mentioned in my earlier response, if I'm looking at academia, the public sector, the private sector, there's a lot of collaboration happening for, let's say, emission friendly fuels, especially hydrogen. So in line with the responses of everyone here, I believe that we are at an exciting time, and I also believe that we are on the cusp of a cleaner energy revolution that's going to happen in the coming decade, if not in the coming years. Great, great. Excellent, Abhijit. That's good to see that. So Chocha, any insight from Nigeria you would like to add in terms of, do you see there's a potential in Nigeria about hydrogen and the same? Yeah, yeah, of course. I also agree, you know, that hydrogen, most especially green hydrogen, it holds a huge potential for meeting zero emissions. One, hydrogen is in abundance. I think it's about the most abundant element, making about 95% of the elements here we can find around us. And it is adaptable across multiple sectors. You see, if it is safely applied to the biggest emission sectors of the global economy, and by that I mean the electricity generation and then the transportation sectors, then I believe we should be able to accelerate the journey to net zero by 2050. Because if we look at it this way, I'll give an analogy, that for every unit of hydrogen that is being applied to meet the energy demand here, either within my country Nigeria or anywhere else in the globe, there's a corresponding proportion of greenhouse gases that's been prevented from entering the ecosystem. So that is it. If we have this in abundance and if we have this in abundance and we utilize this, then we should be expecting to have a proportionate amount of reduction of GHGs. And also, I want to say there have been significant advances in the extraction techniques. And this is something that is driving down the production costs. And we make hydrogen as a very viable fuel and democratize its use across the globe. Thank you. Thanks, Choja. So I can't gain from what you said. Indeed, hydrogen is acting as an alternative fuel to reduce the emission problem and also solve the climate problem that we have. Ogun Droomay, you would like to add anything to say? Yeah. So what's for my end, I would just say that hydrogen is a fuel both of the now and of the future. And it's something that when used would enable us to be able to meet up with most nations in a transition plan. Of recent, we had an interview with the African Center for Energy. And as part of what we propose that for African nations to be able to meet up with their energy transition plans, we have to look at means of incorporating hydrogen fuel as part of our energy transition plan. And with that, we would be able to see that we have let me say close to zero net emission of CO2. But despite the importance of hydrogen fuel, so I feel that there's also need for more research to see how we can be able to reduce the costs to produce hydrogen because the challenge with hydrogen fuel is the cost. So I suggest that we also need to look at ways where the cost of producing hydrogen needs to be reduced. Once it's reduced, that will give more potential to the use of hydrogen fuel and would enable easy and friendly acceptance of it even amongst most nations of the world. So this is just my response to the question. Thank you. Thanks, so yeah, I completely agree where you said that there's a cost component that is attached to both CCUS and hydrogen. And as we've been discussing, there's been a huge investment that is still needed. And we see that that's road trajectory for investments going in the right direction. So we'll just end up with one last question. And then we open the floor for the audience Q&A. So can you share how SPE and petroleum engineering degree has helped you contribute towards sustainability and net zero emissions? So anybody would like to start and maybe Ogunjume, you would like to start and then we move on to the others. Okay, okay. Well, for me, I think SPE has done a whole lot when it comes to CCUS technology, hydrogen as the fuel of the now and of the future, renewable because first, SPE gives us that awareness, the platform for us to know what is happening in the industry. Like I always tell my students that if you don't attend SPE meetings, you may not know what's going on in the industry because what we teach you is the conventional, we'll give you the conventional knowledge. But when you go to SPE meetings, you read papers, conferences and events, you get to know and see what is going on in the industry. And I must also commend SPE because if you look at just as we have the petroleum resource management system, we also have it for story sites where I can classify my story site as either it has improved capacity, is it probable or is it possible? And when I saw that document, I was really, I was marveled and in my mind, I applauded SPE for that because the world is thinking of transiting from Fosif well and SPE has done a lot in that space to see how the world can really transit away from Fosif well. Then again, to the second part of the question, my petroleum engineering knowledge has really helped me a whole lot when it comes to the use of CCUS technologies and also maternity forms of energy. Why I say so is that because for some research work that I've done, I had a master's students that looked at how we can inject CO2 into a depleted reservoir. So if I don't have petroleum engineering knowledge, I don't think I'll be able to really supervise such a project. And I've asked students worked on several projects that also do with alternative forms of energy. And to say as of now, we're also looking at the potential of using hydrogen fuel in Nigeria. So I had a master's student that did a research work on that. So if I don't have the petroleum engineering knowledge, first, I will not have the capacity to be able to supervise such a research and I will not even have the mindset to be able to do such. And like I always tell my students is that you study petroleum engineering, it doesn't mean you cannot venture into any space because petroleum engineering gives you a whole lot of knowledge that all you need to do is to apply your petroleum engineering knowledge. And that is what it will make me to be more proficient when it comes to petroleum economics. Great. Great. Great. Great. Yeah. Yeah. So I completely agree. I'll just kick off this question directly to Abhijit. Maybe 20 seconds more, we want to take some questions from the Q&A. So what do you think, Abhijit, has petroleum engineering helped you to achieve that sustainability factor? And then we move to Chaujam. Yes, please. I'll keep it short. So I've been an active member of SP since 2011 and SP and petroleum engineering foundations have been instrumental in my journey. Even though I began my journey as a core petroleum engineer, I did dive deep into production optimization and hydraulic traction, which is where I found my love for sustainability. So as my colleague just mentioned, it's one of the only areas where you have this manage of opportunities where you can work on multifaceted projects that involves all the way from machine learning, analytics, technology, and all the way up to the things that you're truly passionate and care about. And just to add on, the networking opportunities that SP provides, the platforms that we have, those have guided my core values in shaping some of the solutions that we will be building over time. So thanks. Thank you. Thank you for that. So we have this one question coming from Ghazi Achinian. Chaujam, maybe you can take this up. How the oil and gas industries and support companies plan to sustain the skill per-percent capital financing? So Chaujam, we just have one more minute left. Maybe you can wrap this up quickly. All right. OK. So since we have just one minute, I will take that quickly. OK. So there's a lot which the oil and gas companies here can do or which they are doing. And one of them is rescaling. OK. That they have to invest as in training programs to help their existing employees to adapt to new technologies and methods such as the CCUS, which we are discussing. There are also the partnerships with the academia where they can collaborate with the universities and other technical institutes to ensure that there is a steady supply of talents that are trained in the latest technologies. So these are just as in a few as in of these ways, which I think the oil and gas industry and support companies sustain the skill workforce. Thanks. Thank you so much. I'd like to thank all of you for joining the session, all the virtual attendees and indeed the SP live team. This is Mani Bantul signing off. See you all next time. Thank you so much.

SPE Live Podcast: Technical Director Series ‚Äì Completions and Drilling Operations,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, accelerating the value of women talent in oil and gas. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on February 8th, 2023. And now your moderator, SPE Virtual Programs Development Manager, Natalie Famigietti. Hello and welcome to this SPE Live on Accelerating the Value with Women Talent in Oil and Gas. My name is Natalie Famigietti. I am the SPE Virtual Programs Development Manager. And I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. I will encourage you to ask questions during the program. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guests. Carol Piovesan specializes in oil and gas technology and its application to the topside equipment offshore and onshore. Mrs. Piovesan currently serves as membership chair in the data science and engineering analytics technical section, where she has spent over 15 years as a volunteer. Mrs. Piovesan has published over 15 papers, 10 articles, and contributed to the columns for the SPE's Journal of Petroleum Technology Magazine. Our next guest, Sushma Vann, accomplished global data leader with three decades of experience in leading enterprise data projects. She's currently non-executive board member of ICAN Science and former chief data officer at Shell for Subsurface and Wells. Mrs. Vann is the current chair of SPE's data science and engineering analytics technical section and advisor on Rice University Professional Sciences Master's Board. Sushma, Carol, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you, Natalie. So let's start this conversation with a question for Sushma. Sushma, can you share your views on the areas in the oil and gas industry that women can find more opportunities? And also, would you please share your personal experience about certain challenges faced while paving your career path? Sure, thanks, Natalie. This is a good question. I would say firstly that the whole area of data science and engineering analytics, it's growing tremendously all across oil and gas sector, but also any business, any project you see, DSCA is like a common glue that connects end-to-end the value chain. So if I look from the oil and gas sector, expirations to wells, development all the way to abandonment and sustainability, you can see that there's a huge trust on data and digital and this data science area provides great opportunities. So the key thing is you have to have the right skill sets, experiences, build your know-how so you can step up in these areas. I see almost every project in the business has some element of digitalization or elements of DSCA, the analytics and data, the analytics and data being used because if you look at the tech sector, it very commonly is talking about AI and automation. So the opportunities are tremendous. So women or anybody from any denomination of diversity can join opportunities that are in the area of project management in that area. It's about becoming technical and providing development of software, their architectural elements. You can get into more management roles, executive roles, in general manager and CDO roles. You have to mix your technical acumen and the business acumen together. Needless to say, you need to have a good understanding of the business domain and and the skill sets you bring from data science. The other thing women or anybody can look at, what is the strategic trust at the moment? So we can see that there's a huge upsurge of focus on the low carbon footprint, there are opportunities about automation, AI being used in projects. Just in general, you can see that the cost optimization, increasing production, these are the key strategic areas. We've also looked at the feedback from our SBE members. So look for the growth opportunities and again, see where you can complement your existing skills but also learn additional that will help you step up. But if you look in the job sector, there are tremendous opportunities available. If I think about the challenges, again, let me speak from the general, what were the challenges that we mostly saw? So first and foremost, women depending on what point of stage they are in their life, if they're early joining with young children or they have their personal life aspirations, they have to see that they get the support. They can think about work-life balance, they have a family member helping them, they have the right management support for the kind of changes that might be going in their personal life. So that is very key and I can speak for myself. When I was young and I had two children, I had tremendous support from my husband and my parents so I could raise my children and still do the travel and the necessary things that I needed. Secondly, it is about getting the opportunities. There might be limited opportunities but you can get those opportunities if you have the credibility, you build a trust with your colleagues, with your management and you step up to take those opportunities. You know, it's a little bit of courage but like I said, as the whole sector is changing, there are tremendous opportunities. So there could have been limited opportunities in the past but they are there so you have to just pick them up. The third challenge I found was, you know, even though every company has equal opportunity and huge focus on D&I and it is kind of part of every company's fabric and their strategy, we find that there might be accountability that might be amiss in the middle management. So that again goes to stepping up to change the mindset. They can understand what you can do. I remember when I was very young, I had joined Shell of course in 88 and I had a child, my manager didn't know I would come back to work and needless to say, several of my women colleagues did not come back when they were having children but I had the help of my parents and my spouse so I did. I took my six weeks of maternity leave and came back but needless to say, those are the challenges and if that is an issue, you have to find, you can have that conversation, you can find organizational elements to support you, be open and honest about those things and work that but that could be one. The fourth one could be about development, right? You come with certain skill sets, you're a reservoir engineer or geologist and you may not have, let's say, the data science area. So you have to see, have you developed them, what are the areas you need to grow? I remember when I started my career with certain areas, this was in programming and so you had, let's say, assembler and Fortran to start with and then you moved to object-oriented and Java and C++ and so forth so you have to keep seeing how do you grow yourself. So I took some classes in the night school and wanted to get much better at it though even I had some training from Shell. So you have to keep developing, you have to sharpen your saw and see whether you go to school back, you go to college, you do online. I even went to school and got my MBA while my kids were young. So that personal development to make you successful for what you are being asked to do or kind of aspirations you have is very key. So define your success and go for it. And lastly is if things don't work out, it's not the right role, right organization, right company, I would say have the courage to change. You could change within your company, navigate or you can opt for going outside and doing something different. Sushma, thank you so much for your feedback and your insights. Family support is very important, I agree with you and looking for those mentors is also a great suggestion for the professionals. So Carol, I would like to continue with you with the next question. What does diversity, equity and inclusion mean to you personally? And can you share your personal experiences in this regard? Sure, thank you. So for me, it's about respecting each other and embracing our differences and doing that with courage and intelligence to work together and achieve great things, whether they're small or large. We work in a global industry that has many beautiful cultures. I've learned a lot just hearing the stories of everyone. People bring their stories, people are their stories. We need to learn more about each other. For example, I attended a conference, a women's conference. It was an international networking conference in Switzerland. And there was a woman there and she was a speaker, very dynamic, lovely woman. She came from Egypt and her father had passed their business, their family cotton business to her and her brother. And she was identified as the person to mediate all conflict within her family's business. And this meant conflicting religions and backgrounds. And yet she had to mediate this for everyone to have a successful business. These are the things that we can bring to the table as being diverse and include each other. Another one was a woman from India, the northern part of India, where she had to really work with what she had considered a fear from the men in her village to bring the women's standard of living up. And to do that, that was to create cashmere shawls and sell them. And there was a lot of pushback. And her story was so inspiring. She went and embraced the trust from the captain of the army in the village and got his support to help the women increase their lives. And so they both learned to take the fear out of their situations. And I think that's what we need to do as women is take the fear out of our situations, have the courage, bring your personal intelligence to the parties and merit your position. A lot of women have a lot of merit and need to lean in to these opportunities in their lives and lead in your feminine way. There's a lot of beauty in that. And I've learned that along the way. Those are incredible stories, Carol. Thank you for sharing that with us. At this moment, I would like to remind our audience to submit your questions. Carol and Sushma are here to answer your questions. If you're watching this episode from Energy Stream, then check the chat box at the bottom of your screen. And if you're watching this episode from LinkedIn, then submit your questions via the comments tab on the right. Then I would like to continue with my third question. And this is for both of you, Sushma and Carol. Let's start with Sushma. In your opinion, what are the personal practices that have made you successful? Can you share your personal journey and experiences? Yeah, definitely. And I would say, Natalie, that over my career journey, there were a lot of different things that I had to embrace. So firstly, when I started my career, I was very much in technical roles. So it was very key for me to stay current with state-of-art technology. Even though we had started, for example, a project in Shell, which was on some key information or that's a new coding language, I did supplement some of that additional knowledge by going to a night school and making sure that I could get much better at it. I was also very quick at learning and changing as needed. So I'll give you an example. When I first started, we were working with initial coding like Fortran and Assembler. And very soon, we started moving to object-oriented area. We started moving to Java and C++. So it was very important that I understand what is the current needs and change for that. And then in my mid-career, I found that I wanted to move, for example, to the business roles. And I took it upon myself to take leadership classes, and I joined MBA. So even though I had two young kids, I said, that is something that's going to give me additional lever. So getting that additional insights and confidence to go forward, that will help me, was kind of the thing. The other thing I personally did was I knew the area of data sciences, the information technology was very dynamic. We went through a lot of cyclical changes. There was a whole information development area that got outsourced, for example, to India. But there were certain high-tech things that were retained in the company. So it was very key for me to understand those changes. So you have to have an eye and keep a look at what are the strategic changes your company is going through? What is the demand? What are the areas that are of growth? Like I spoke in the beginning, like carbon footprint, and those areas are very key. So you might want to just step up and think about where you want to change and be ready for that. As Carol said, you have to have the courage. You have to start picking those knowledge areas. And again, there are a lot of people who would be willing to help you. In my company, I found that if you reach out to experts and discussed and learned from that, it really helped you gain the insights. So not being afraid and going out, reaching out, and learning things, that was very important. The other thing was stepping up to take roles that were never, for example, taken by women. I was in many teams where I was the first one, but you are there because you have delivered on the goals, your prompt, you're diligent about it, because those are the things that really build your credibility and reputation. So you have to be there because you can excel, you can deliver, and you can exceed the expectations. And it does take a lot of planning and rigor, but definitely that is what vouches for you. The merit and the credibility that the foundation you build, you can stand on it. So for me, that was very key. I could see that one of the very exciting roles I had in my career was leading the global wells, reservoirs, and facility management program for data. And in Shell, that's a huge program that accelerates production from existing assets. And one of the big problems there was about data accessibility and so forth. So I was one of the key persons who stepped in that and established a practice that was replicated across the globe, worked with people from several countries, more than 20 countries. But it was that step-by-step, putting in practice the project management skills I had learned. But if I had been afraid or if I was just not able to step up and take that opportunity, I would have missed a lot out. So really, it is your mindset, it's working with the people, it's developing and going forward, keeping that sharp, your saw always sharp and ready. And again, be willing to change as need be. Yeah, I mean, I totally agree with you, Sushma. Take every opportunity you can. Don't be afraid. I mean, you can do it. So thank you so much for your insight. Carol, would you like to follow up? Sure. The thing that I think I've always lived by is one rule, and that is honesty, integrity, and fairness. And I think that's really helped me along the way to live by those rules and be humble about it. People appreciate being humble. I don't know everything. I started my career as the only woman in the room at the meetings, and a long time as that. And still today, sometimes I'm the only woman in the meeting. And that's okay. I accept that. And I appreciate that, because everybody brings a lot of intelligence to the meeting. And I wouldn't be in those meetings if I wasn't bringing something to them. So it's being humble. I believe this is a personal rule that I've lived by. I think people respect me and my colleagues respect me for that. Especially when the world isn't always fair. And it's just that way. But you keep going. I always try to keep an open mind. The world is judgmental, but you keep leading with a soft touch. Be curious. You keep leading with a soft touch. Be curious. Have humor. I now mentor two men and two women. When I started my career, very few people were mentoring. And I always was told that you should have five mentors in your career. And now I have the opportunity to be one for somebody else. And I appreciate that I have two men that I mentor. So I think come a long way. It's never easy to balance it all. You do your best. You do what you can. And I think you compartmentalize what's important. You prioritize what's important. And you will make it. You just get up every day. And as we say in Texas, you put your boots on and you keep walking. Thank you, Carla, for your insights. I like that keep an open mind. And I mean, work is not going to be fair all the time. Just keep on going and do your best. I mean, those are great insights and feedback from both of you. We're getting great questions from the audience. But let's continue with the third question. This is for both of you. So both of you have been in the data science arena and were earlier in the technical section and now on the data science and engineering analytics technical section board. Can you share your outlook on future perception of the industry with data science as the key enabler? Do you see this as a key accelerator for gender diversity in the oil and gas industry? Sushma, let's start with you, please. Yeah, absolutely, Natalie. This is one area, like I mentioned earlier, that is rapidly growing. And I see data science and analytics as a common glue that goes across all the disciplines, all the business sectors. And one of the things that is neat about this area is where you could have young women with children having challenges about, like, let's say, going on to the rig or some difficult countries. Many of these jobs can be easily done in the office or you can do it through virtual. So there are tremendous opportunities that you can step up to and do it with a lot more ease, you know, the timing being right and so forth. But needless to say, it is such a key area that needs to be embraced by everyone, irrespective of gender, race, or any kind of denomination, because that is kind of the key mantra across all companies you see. Initialization and data science is a key lever to accelerate the business results. It has to bring cost optimization and use the right resources. We hear about tech companies talking about AI all too. So I think it's very pertinent that whether it's men or women, they start understanding and learning about this area. There are opportunities not only within the realm of your job or if you want to look out for jobs, but also if you want to learn. You're a student and you want to volunteer. So we have, for example, a lot of data thorns happening. You can join and you can learn and equip yourselves with some of the experiences you can reach out to other people. So that is another key area. I would put a pitch in for society of petroleum engineers. That's a key platform for those of us who are within the oil and gas sector or even outside to come and join that forum to learn, to nurture yourself, to understand what are the dynamics of the business. It's a great platform to build your various skills, including your leadership and communications and other areas. We have a strong technical section, DSCATS. If you would look on that, we have several women and men from various countries, various experiences. So again, I would say be willing to join, raise your hand and expand. I would just say you also have to find people who encourage you, whether it's your managers or mentors. I was very lucky that I met Carol, for example, at ATCE and she asked me, hey, would you join the BEATS board, which was Digital Energy Technical Section, and then the past two technical section directors, you know, Birol Dinduruk and Silviu, they were very encouraging. So it's up to you to step up and take these opportunities. They might be a little bit of extra personal effort, because in addition to your job, you're doing something. But again, it enhances your skills. But overall, if you look at the data science arena, it's just expanding everywhere. And if you're equipped with the right skills, you can also change your business sectors. I recently know somebody who was working in an oil and gas service company and she has joined Walmart. So you can take those learnings from a different sector, different consulting company and come so that cross-pollination of insights, ideas and knowledge is a lot more doable in the SCA area than anywhere else. But definitely you have to pick up the discipline, knowledge and insights. So I'll leave it at that and let Carol add more. Thank you, Sushma. Carol, would you like to follow up? Sure. Thank you. So I started technology in my career and then it came into oil and gas. So to me, these two industry sectors are the largest in the world and the most exciting. This is a really exciting time to be in technology and in oil and gas. There's an abundance of opportunities. I think you just really have to decide what part you want to be in. We go through ups and downs. There's no crystal ball. Be prepared to change with these ups and downs. I've seen things come full circle. I've had to be patient. I brought technology in eight years ago to certain operations and it's just now getting adopted. So you have to continue to lean in and push, write papers, be your own star and sell yourself to the people around you. I think that's networking and talking, coaching. Be adaptable, be coachable and keep learning. Thank you, Carol, Sushma, for your insights. Let's take a question from the audience. So hello, everyone. How to balance personal life and professional life? So this question is coming from LinkedIn. Sushma? Yeah, so I can go first. It's really up to you how you do that. What I did personally for myself when I had young children was I would integrate my both personal and professional calendar. So I knew what was critical for me. For example, I had to take my child for vaccination or something and I would plan for it. So really the key there is planning ahead, understanding what are your personal needs for your family and what are your professional commitments. And you have to be very honest and upfront about it. If it's something that cannot be handled and it sort of impedes your professional needs, you have to work that with your management or with your team. So I'll give you an example. I was always leading this Bell's Residence and Facility Management Common Interest Network, which had members from all the 20 countries, but unfortunately I had a death in the family and I had to fly to India. So I made that clear to my colleague and she was able to keep running the show. And when I was back in India, I could still, when things were okay, connect back. Or there's something very important and then you need support from your family member or friends. So I think the key to that for me had been looking ahead, planning, using your calendar well, and then working it out. It's all doable. Thank you, Sushma. Carol, do you have any suggestions for our audience? Oh, Sushma hit a lot of points. It's organizational skills and priorities. And like she said, planning ahead, it's everybody, whether you're a man, woman or whatever, older, you have to figure out how to do all that and balance it all. So it's everybody's problem. Yes, yes, I agree. So let's take another question from the audience. Why do women need to prove themselves more than men? And this is coming from LinkedIn. Who would like to take this question? I don't think women have to prove themselves more than men. I grew up, I went to an all girls school and the studies at that time said, men tend to raise their hands to answer a question faster than women. And so they tend to be chosen by the teachers to answer the question. So raise your hand faster. Is that the answer? It's not that you have to prove yourself. It's just making it work for you. Yeah, I would add to that is, again, you know, it's not about proving yourself to others. It's like, you know, being competent for what you're being asked for. And you have to do that with confidence. You have to step up. Needless to say, they're always biases. You know, there might be jobs which have not been done before. I remember early in my career when I first time went to my manager and said, Hey, you know, I'm expecting my first child, he believed I would not come back to work. And I had to tell him and convince him, No, I am. And, you know, the only time I took off was my six weeks of maternity leave. So I think you have to work with the system. They are they are people you'll deal with their difficult mindset. But again, it's up to you to educate them, work with them, you know, use your organizational legal if you have to. But it's like anybody else, you know, where there are challenges and they may not be seeing the whole picture. So it's for you to, you know, bring that to light and show it by what you can deliver and do. Thank you, Sushma and Carol. We're getting close to finishing this SP live. But before that, Sushma and Carol, can you please, what is your message for women and young, young aspiring professionals entering the energy field in, let's say three words, for example, mentoring, take an opportunity you want, get support from your family, things like that. So can you give us some suggestions? Well, I mean, I could rant off a lot of things, but I think the first and foremost thing is, you know, believe in yourself, have that confidence with the right knowledge. Number two is you have to be reliable. You know, when people are asking for something, you know, be committed, deliver, you know, that sort of builds your credibility. You know, if people see, you know, you take on something and can do it, and you can do it better than anybody else, you're naturally going to be asked again. So you can do that. The third thing I quickly want to say is differentiate yourself. And that could be, you know, specialize yourself in area. We learn a lot of things. You know, I, for example, specialize myself in the data arena. You know, I joined SP. So you build that so people see, you know, what is that you bring to the table? You might know a lot of things. I think those are the quick three things I would say. Thank you, Sushma. Carol? Have fun. Don't be afraid to change. Stay courageous and lead with grace. Those are great suggestions to our audience. Thank you so much, Carol, Sushma. And to our audience, if you want to learn more about these topics, I invite you to attend the webinar that is already available on demand. And also keep an eye on the upcoming Get to Know series on women in energy, which will be rolling out in March. So thank you so much, everybody once again, and we'll see you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast. For more content, visit the SPE Energy Stream, the industry's digital pulse at streaming.spe.org.

SPE Live Podcast: Pre-ATCE Series: HSE & Sustainability - Tangible Pathways,"Hi, welcome everybody. It is a beautiful, cool spring morning here in Houston. We will be talking about leadership. Music So I am very honored and proud to introduce a truly esteemed expert panel of speakers to you today. The panel will be addressing how leaders act and steer their organizations through what must be one of the most challenging times in the oil industry. We are facing two major challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic and the current low oil price environment caused by oversupply and lack of global demand due to this pandemic recession. So the panelists will share their insights on how these two waves are impacting oil and gas and the management and sustainability of the business. How it's impacting the workforce, the SPE and the future industry interaction, including academia and other parallel industries. COVID-19 is obviously mostly impacting office workers and the traditional styles of learning in universities and schools. The work-life balance is all over the place right now, as you can all imagine. It's also affecting in many places field operations, but mostly it's the low oil price environment that's impacting field operations and the future outlook for oil and gas, including the continuation and sustainability of our business. So it's a very important time for us to look at how we lead our industry through the current climate. So on the panel today, we have Sami Al Nuaim. He is the outgoing 2019 SPE president, a 30-year veteran of petroleum engineering at Saudi Aramco. He is speaking today in his capacity as the 2019 SPE president. Also on the panel, we have Tom Plasenghemi, the 2021 SPE president. So he's the incoming president. He'll be taking over in September. Renowned expert in reservoir engineering and well production. He is the holder of the Robert L. Whiting Professorship at the Department of Petroleum Engineering, Texas A&M. Also on the panel, Eve Sprunt. She is a 35-year-old oil and gas industry veteran, having worked for several super major operators. She is today a thought leader, speaker on business leadership, industry trends, technology and workforce issues. She is also a past president for SPE back in 2006 and is a past president of the American Geosciences Institute in 2018. And finally on the panel, Kamel Ben Nasr. He is the CEO of Nomadia Energy Consulting, previously chief economist for Adnok and earlier director for sustainability, technology and outlooks at the prestigious IEA. Now, this expert group of panelists will be led by our moderator today, Maria Angela Capello. She is the chair of the SPE Business Management and Leadership Committee and is currently executive consultant at the Kuwait Oil Company. So very, very excited to introduce all these people. It's going to be an absolutely outstanding discussion. So once again, welcome to our program. I shall now pass you all over to our panelists. Hello all. How are you? My name is Maria Angela Capello and I am connecting from Kuwait in what is the end of a very sunny day, beautiful day in Kuwait. So I want to welcome you all to this panel on behalf of the Business Management and Leadership Committee of the SPE. As the chair of the committee, it is my pleasure to let you know that our main objective is to foster and provide venues for the growth, the professional growth of our members. And one of those skills that we are fostering and encouraging is leadership. So it's not a coincidence that the panel title today is SPE Talks Leadership. So we have wonderful leaders today with us, four SPE presidents, nothing less, nothing more than that, who are our natural role models. We have prepared a set of questions for them and we are about to start. And because of that, it is my pleasure now to let you know a little bit about them. Already they were introduced by Niels, but I want to let you know while they are connecting that we have Sami Annouin, 2019 president, 30 year veteran of petroleum engineering, Tom Blasingen, 2021 SPE president, Dr. Eve Sprout. She was also SPE president in 2006. And Dr. Kamel Ben-Nassour that has been selected as the incoming president. I have mentioned all of you and I am so proud. We are all proud to have you as our panelists. And let's start. I think that we want to hear from our audience and especially from me. And my first question is, what measures and priorities leaders in our industry take or probably already took during this crisis? And I would like to address this question to Dr. Sami. Thank you, Maria and Niels for putting this all together. Really a very, very interesting event by SPE. So thanks to all those who are really putting it together and behind the scene. Before I answer the question, I just want to say that this current crisis, COVID-19, is really nothing like the downturn and the crisis that we have seen so far. Many of us in this panel really lived long to see so many downturns and some kind of economic decisions that we witnessed in myself in the last 30 years experience. In the industry, I've seen the oil price drop in the 80s, in the 90s, in the 2008 and in the last in 2014 and 15. But this is indeed different. It's different and unique because it's a scope, it's a geographical scale, and it's a great impact, not only in the oil and gas industry, but all industries at large, basically. Those of you who follow the news, for example, in the US alone, I've heard that more than 20 million people filed for jobs during the month of April. So the impact is so huge. And I would like just to start by saying our sympathy and prayer goes to those victims of this virus and those who lost their lives. To answer the question, Maria, I think in my opinion that because of its unique nature, the unique nature of this crisis, it needs really unique leaders as well to address it. And we're so lucky to have so many of these in our industry. In my opinion, there are six priorities that need to be looked at by the oil and gas leaders. The first is the safety of our people, the people who really energize the world, who pump the oil and gas. Although we adopted a new business model by working remotely because of the investment that we put earlier in the digitization. But also we have some people, also they have to work from facilities or having some critical functions, operating facilities, operating grids and so on. So the safety of our people, I think, is the top priority of any leader for that sake. The second priority, which is linked to that one, which is the business continuity. Again, we are talking about a loss of 30 million barrels, a sudden loss of 30 million barrels a day when it comes to the global oil demand. But let's not forget that we're still producing 70 million barrels of oil per day and hundreds of billions scuffed of gas that are really needed. Not only to keep the modern life as it is also, but also to help the people to fight and help governments and organizations and the health sector to fight this virus. We tend to think of oil only for leisure cars and airplanes, but it's not. It's really involved in every aspect that we do. If you look at, for example, how much oil is used basically to support the transportation associated with cargo, with marine transportation, supporting the emergency organizations. When it comes to gas, also looking at the petrochemicals and the downstream manufacturing of the petrochemicals that eventually get us something like ventilators used by the health personnel to save lives. And of course, not forgetting the gas used in the fertilizer business to boost the food production as well as to provide energy to lighten our facilities, our buildings, and our cities. So that's the second priority. It's really very important to put it in perspective. The third priority, in my opinion, is to focus on tapping on technology, really, to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Tapping on the IR 4.0, the industrial revolution technology to reduce costs instead of releasing manpower. It would be really very important to tap on technology. I know that there will be some tough decisions to reduce costs and tough decisions probably to delay certain projects. But let's not forget the strategic nature of our business, of our industry. We never plan for short-term in our industry. We always look at the long-term and the long-term demand for the global energy when it comes to that matter. I always say during my tenure as the CEO president, I always say those who invest in decisions and downturn are those who will be ready to harvest their investment during the upturn. As I said, we've seen so many downturns, but it's something that for sure we know about that there will be upturn coming after. Now, how soon that is, probably a few weeks, maybe a few months, maybe until the end of the year, we don't know. But we know that the demand for energy, the demand for oil will come back to its normal level. So those who invest during recession and those who invest during downturn will be really ready to harvest it. The fourth priority I would say is collaboration. Collaboration is really the venue to help. We need to help each other and we've seen good examples in the oil and gas industry in terms of collaboration, whether in the technical and developing technologies working together or even in the soft issues like addressing the climate challenge through OGCI. And a good example even related to the oil prices and putting stabilization between supply and demand, the thing that we've seen last month during the month of April, the OPIC and OPIC Plus, OPIC Plus Plus as well, coming together, collaborating together to address this issue globally. So there is no one entity that can solve that. The fifth priority in my opinion also, we as an industry also have unmatched social responsibility program. And this is about the time really to increase it. We need to help our communities, our governments, our cities really to address this. And I'm very happy to see so many international and international oil companies announcing some social responsibility programs. Some of them encouraging their employees to donate money and they are matching the amount that they collect from their employees. So this is the spirit that we would like to really encourage and promote in our society. And last but not least, we have to do all of the above, all of what I've said really, without losing focus on safety, which is really very, very important, not losing focus on doing our operation in an environmentally friendly manner. And last but not least, which is very, very important, sometimes we lose focus during panic mode, which is the cybersecurity. We know that the oil and gas industry, one of the top targets of the hackers. And guess what? This is the best time for them. Really, this is the best time for them when people are addressing a crisis. I can trick anyone by phishing email with the title of how to fight COVID-19, for example. So we really need to deliver all of these basically by focusing, while focusing on safety, while focusing on the environment, which is very important and most importantly, focusing on our cybersecurity, protecting our facilities and our people and the supply of energy. It's all at spe.org. Thank you very much, Sami. You have set up the stage with a very good plan view about the oil industry and the priorities. Four priorities that you mentioned, which are very, very core to our business. Thank you very much, Sami. But I would like, using one of our own terms in the oil industry, I would like to drill down into leadership because our panel is about leadership. And now I would like to call Dr. Campbell. Dr. Campbell, can you tell us a little bit more specific about what actions do you think leaders need to take during the pandemic? But I also want to pick your mind about what they need to do after the pandemic. Thank you, Maria, for the invitation and good day from very sunny Abu Dhabi today. So the COVID-19 crisis is unique in the last 50 years, as mentioned by Dr. Sami, as it combines a global health one, an economic one and an energy one. So it's a triple Black Swan with a magnitude not seen before. After what has been called the Black Monday on April 20th, the IEA's executive director, Dr. Fatih Birol, described April 2020 as the worst month in the worst quarter and what could be the worst year for energy markets. But I guess the good news is that April is behind us and looking forward, the derivative sign and it should be positive. So in terms of leaders, we have to look at them like jugglers because they have to combine action taking for the short term and review completely the medium and long term strategy. So they have to balance those two things. So they have to balance the requirement for being prepared now and ensuring that the organization that they are leading is resilient. And at the Business Management and Leadership Committee, which is headed by our colleague Maria Capello, resilience is a very important term. We teach our members about their own resiliency, but also how to make their own organization resilient. And also, along with that, is being prepared for a new type of what we would call stress testing for the organization or other people called being future proof. Stress testing was very much used for the financial sector after the 2008 financial crisis and making sure that our financial institutions are ready for any events of the magnitude that we have seen in 2008. So the stress testing that would happen in the energy sector would include taking into account some of the extraordinary factors that have happened, including the shutdown of production to a level that we have never seen before, as well as some of the comments by Dr. Sami on the on the cyber security and other threats. So again, going back to the juggling between short term and long term, the first action, I fully agree with Dr. Sami should be on the HSS&E efforts to make the workplace a safe one. The second is ensuring business continuity. And this includes things like ensuring the strength of cyber security and reorganize the work practices so that they adapt to the different phases of deconfinement. So we have seen, we're seeing a number of countries getting out of confinement, coming in different stages. So the workplace needs to adapt to the different modes. The third one is fully reconnecting with customers. And obviously they are, they should be on top of the list. And fourth one is protecting financially their institutions. And this is in many cases preventing risks of bankruptcies. So there would be difficult decisions, especially on human capital one. And I like very much a quote from consulting group Deloitte, who's saying leaders should simultaneously design from the heart and the head by empathizing with their employees, customer and their broader ecosystems, yet simultaneously adopting a rational line to protect financial performance from distribution, from disruptions. So that we, I want to stress the empathy word, which is extremely important with our workforce, given the amount of disruption they are taking from a professional and family life. And also the fact that we need to design not only from the head, but also from the heart. So going to the medium and long term perspective, in medium term, the next, let's say three years, there should be tactical responses to what the situation has implied, especially in terms of disruption into the production stream and for the longer term, reevaluate completely the strategic options to accommodate future scenarios, including as much as possible what could be looked at as black swaps. So in the business management, the leadership committee, we are also emphasizing the strategic and as being an essential part of the business and a key ingredient of leadership. Thank you, Kamel. Thank you. That's very interesting to hear. Okay. I'm going to bring in Eve here. So Eve, you are also a long term veteran of the oil and gas industry. So listening to what Sami had to say and what Kamel was just commenting now, what do you, what in your opinion are the critical business management and leadership skills to help overcome the current crisis in the industry? I think we can look at leaders of many types to see what works and what doesn't work in terms of things. And I think one of the two key things about leaders are you need to be decisive. So it's, you know, you are the leader, the buck stops there and you need to be responsible. But at the same time, you also need to be flexible because in this case, as everyone said, this is unprecedented. We don't have case studies to go back to and say these are the best practices in something like this. So it's being flexible, willing to change course and say what has worked, what hasn't worked and taking responsibility for those actions. Because with leadership comes responsibility. It also means being compassionate and listening to people. So one of the challenges here is we've got a virus that nobody sees as having be fully under control within a short period of time. When do you change the rules? When do you flex to something else? And how do you balance? How do you take, you know, integrate all these actions together? So it's really taking responsibility for what you're doing and being decisive. Your messaging also has to be very clear. We've seen examples from world leaders where when you read their message, you can see how it makes sense. But since the way it's presented, people find very confusing. So I think it's it's leading by example. You really want to role model what you're asking people to do for you. So and I didn't mention everybody else mentioned where they are. I'm in California. So we have the example of a local leader who's been decisive and stepped up and a national leader who people have a lot of questions about. OK, thank you. So, I mean, what you were saying there is really I mean, it's very well, there's a lot about emotional intelligence and the importance of that in leadership. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence S.P.E. programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other S.P.E. members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location or experience level. To learn more about the League of Volunteers, visit spe.org volunteer. I'm going to switch to Tom now. So, you know, you're an academic, you teach students, you lead students. So how are you going to equip students now and teach them about sort of emotional intelligence to sort of help them equip them for this future? I mean, these kind of conditions may reoccur in the future. So how would you go about leading students and teaching them emotional intelligence? Thank you, Nils, and greetings to everyone from lovely College Station, Texas. As many of you know, I'm also a New Zealander and my family's 10,000 miles away. And as you pointed out, there's certainly differences in how governments handle things. And I stayed here for my daughter. So that was an interesting time. I hope everyone got to reconnect with their family. The question really is about how do we prepare people for what's happening and what will happen? And I sort of give timelines. There's a near term where things are going to be really difficult to predict. I appreciate you pointing out there are no case histories on this. I mean, maybe there are case histories on crises, but nothing of this scale and certainly nothing of this. It impacts every individual. I had to give this some thought, quite frankly. And I think the number one thing you do is you be honest and you tell people this is absolutely the toughest time our industry has ever faced. I've got 146 days before I come on board as president. And I feel like each one of those days last a year because I know how hard this is going to be. This is going to be a transformation of our industry. It's going to be a transformation of our professional society. It's going to be a transformation of our lives, certainly of our work life. I think you have to be realistic. You have to explain to people it's not going to be the same work environment, nor the same priorities, nor the same workload. Work-life balance has actually improved, they say, under this. But simultaneously, they say people are also working two to three more hours a day for the last couple of months. And can that be sustained? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's going to be expected to be sustained. So, you know, we're going to have to live with that. You need to be authentic. You need to tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. The niceties are over. You know, we've the closest analog, I guess, to this is war. And we're going to have to make some very difficult decisions. It will pass. Things will change. But the devastation that this is wreaking will be very real across all scales. In some ways, it won't look any different. But in many industries, many societies, the after effects will last for decades. The loss of capital, the loss of jobs, you know, a near global refocus on oil and gas, which are much easier to recover, much lower cost to recover, is going to be important. A lot of young people don't have any experience with conventionals. They've they've been engaged mostly in unconventional, certainly in the U.S. for the last 10 or so years. They'll have to adapt. And my last comment on this is you have to be progressive. People who can adapt quickly, they will. There's a lot of young people that I mentor, a lot of young people that I encounter, and they ask me what to do. And I say, adapt. Take on new challenges, new roles. People who are unprepared skills wise, motivationally, et cetera, they're going to have a difficult time with this. And they're going to have to decide whether or not they can and will adapt. But it will be a very significant different future. It's going to be. I want to say Darwinism in its purest form that people are going to have to adapt in order to survive and companies will as well. We'll talk more about how companies adapt to this, and I'm sure that others who work directly for companies will give you that. Education is going to be fine. You know, we have demonstrated we can work remotely, that we can work virtually, that we can deliver. A lot of the students have said, and I'm sure I'm going to get flack for this, that they are actually much better at this than the faculty are. But give the faculty a break. They'll evolve. They'll figure out how to use Zoom or when to turn the mute button on and off and not to leave the camera on whenever they're may not be fully dressed or something silly like that. But that part will be OK. And the other issues that people worry about, about how do they connect with their faculty and so on, we'll work that out. So I look for a very bright and capable future in terms of education. When we talk in a little while, I'll tell you that the next year will be very difficult. The next couple of years will be a little bit of uncertainty, but certainly we'll be coming out of it. And the next few years after that will be, unfortunately, probably another boom. Well, many thanks. This is Maria. And you know, Tom, what you said really rings a bell because you are talking about adaptability. And if there is something that we have seen in this crisis, which is not only the COVID, but also the low price of oil, was the new alliances, we saw something, traditional antagonists like the US and the OPEC or Russia, you know, making deals and agreements that we never seen before. And my question now would like Kamel to address it with his international experience and insights. Kamel, what do you think, will this prevail in the new leadership, this new way of adaptation and negotiations that we have witnessed? So it has been an extraordinary roller coaster in the last two months. After a breakdown in early March, we have seen the negotiation expand from OPEC to OPEC plus and then to OPEC plus plus. The move to OPEC plus happened about four or five years ago due to the US shares and the OPEC plus plus happened because of COVID-19. So the first point is that the economies of the oil exporting countries are being extremely impacted by the fall in prices combined with the decrease in demand. So there is a very strong willingness from many from social to make it work. Most countries, even if they produce oil at less than $20 per barrel, need much more to balance their budget. So Russia, for instance, needs between $40 and $50 to balance their budget. Other countries, most other countries need anywhere from $20 to $200 per barrel to balance their budget. So they have to let those prices up and increasing their market share will not help them significantly. The US situation is different because it's an open and competitive market and also you have different types of players between majors and independence. But I mean, we have seen recently the issues of storage being one of the drivers for shut-ins. So for me, the big test for this alliance, expanded alliance, will be the adherence to the production cuts that have been decided, especially for the month of May and June. 23% cut in production has never been done as a collective action. And we have also seen yesterday Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait are going for further cuts. Saudi Arabia by nearly a million barrels per day and UAE and Kuwait by hundreds of thousands of barrels. So that means that there is a strong willingness to go even what was decided in the OPEC++ discussions and around the G20 meeting. The second big test will be the ability to restore production after once the cuts are lifted. Again, we have never seen anything like this. And I was recently at an SP webinar with the Minister of South American Country who was mentioning that, or I think it was the CEO of the oil company, was saying that after strike that shut down their production, they were able to restore after significant effort, 92% of their production. So this kind of cut is like terra incognita for many countries as they have never done anything like this. So this will be a very significant stress test for those countries and challenge their willingness to go for similar agreements if this situation unfortunately happens and they have to curtail production again. Well, thank you, Kamal. I think those insights help to understand the overall and overarching efforts needed to go back and improve the current situation. But talking about improving the current situation in the energy sector, many people are now working remotely or in virtual teams. And my next question will be for Dr. Eve Sprond, because I was wondering how or what tricks can you give us? How can we motivate a team that is virtual, that is remote working? I think you definitely have to stay engaged with people. There's people-to-people contact. But fortunately, we're blessed right now with so many fantastic communication mechanisms. And I look at it that working through a group like SPE, so often you have to work out, reach out remotely. When I first became engaged with SPE in the early 80s, long distance phone calls and things like that were very primitive. You had echoes from the satellite connections. But one of the things about working through SPE is that you find often you can't do things face to face. We're a global organization. We're working all around the world, all hours of the day at night. And so you reach out in whatever ways you have. And so I found over the years, I've made very, built very strong relationships with people who are very far from me. And that's not only working when I was working for Mobile early in my career and money. My projects were in Indonesia and I was in Dallas that I've been working remotely and globally for decades. So it's something you can do very well. And I think that leaders have to reach out. They have to touch their people in effect, check in with them, see how they're doing, see what their issues are. You could do the equivalent of what many old fashioned managers like to do, which is managing by walking around, by electronically walking around and checking in on your team, finding out what their issues are. So we have the means to do all the same types of reaching out electronically that people would do if congregated in an office. So I think it's a question of just getting over the fact that you're doing it remotely and that they're very powerful things that I can say. It's like Maria, Angela and I are very, very good friends, but we have only spent a few days over many decades in each other's presence. And I have many, many good friends all around the globe who I have met very rarely. And I think that electronically we make use of the assets, the fabulous electronic assets that we have. Well, thank you, Eve. Communication, communication and communication, I get from what you say. Yes. So thank you. Thank you. That's very important. And perhaps there are a set of our members that are very, very well versed in these new techniques. Those are the students. And that will take me to my next question. How do you inject good energy and positive energy? And I would like again to ask this to Tom because of his role in academia. I would like to know how do you inject good positive energy now, you know, in the new cohorts of students relatable to petroleum engineering? Honestly, Maria, maybe we're spoiled, those of us who are academics, but we see students as always being highly motivated. I think they recognize that the market is really difficult right now. But even, you know, at late night, last night, I had a meeting with the student officers of our chapter because they moved the meeting tonight because some of them do have internships. Some of them don't. They accept the fact that that this is an unusual situation. My own graduate students are, you know, they struggle with jobs. They struggle with the usual caveats about the future of the industry and so forth. But I think everyone understands brutal right now. It's just a fact. I'll also comment that we've had our our best innovations during downturns. And I'd also comment that while, you know, what do they say? Causation is not correlation. We seem to have our best leaders evolve and emerge during downturns. I think it's same thing's going to happen here. I mean, well, I know it is that, you know, certainly the the established people in the industry will acclimate to this. They'll do fine. The young people actually are accustomed to acclimating. I do think it's a hard sell to to look at enticing or encouraging young people to come into petroleum engineering. But my speech hasn't changed throughout my career. If you really want to be a petroleum engineer, there's always going to be a role for petroleum engineers. And secondly, you know, hard work does correlate with success. If you're the hardest working person in the room, you're not going to ever have to worry about a job. There's also an entrepreneurial aspect of petroleum engineering, which many of our former students, which we call our alumni, sorry, they adapt to and have created service companies, operating companies, investment companies and so on. There's plenty of opportunities, but the short term brutality of this and everyone has said this is real. We just have to sort of nurture them through this pit. And like I said, I think that as we come out of it, there will be a shortage of talent. It is not going to be pleasant. I don't enjoy when there's a shortage of talent. I don't enjoy when there's a glutton talent. But like I'll end with where I started, which is downturns or challenging times tend to bring out people who evolve or emerge as our best leaders. I'm looking forward to that. And I think that's the way we ought to treat this as as education is offered. As I mentioned before, it'll change dramatically because of this. We'll be able to offer anything anytime. I think there's a role for SB for that. I don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I do think SB can help facilitate that. And I will strongly encourage that when it's my turn to speak for that. So I'll hand it back to you. Well, thank you, because I think that is a vision that we need to share with the membership. I mean, there is a positive outlook out there, not only for the students, but also for us as petroleum engineers and in the industry as a whole. And that brings me to another question that I have here and is relatable to the SP and the new normal. Because how"
SPE Live Podcast: Leadership Development Impacts Career Transition and Progression,"the Alright, welcome to the S B podcast. I'm Trent Jacobs, and today I'm talking to Matthias Carlson. He's a petroleum engineer consultant and general manager with Whitson, which is a software and consulting company that specializes in some pretty cool oil and gas research. In the last couple of years, he's authored and co authored with five S B papers that have that right, and I've seen him present a couple of these recently, so I wanted to have him come in and talk about some of the things that he's been doing. And I'm going to talk to him about a couple of things that he's been doing to speak about a very kind of wonky issue, but we're going to see if we can have fun with it. It's called separator oil shrinkage and what that means. All right, Matthias. So we met gosh. It's two or three months ago. We met in November and we were in the same room with this whole crew. Then I saw you again last week in Saudi Arabia. And the funny part is that we probably work just a few miles apart here in Houston. And this happens to me all the time. You know, I have to fly around the world or go to another state to meet somebody that works, you know, 10, 10 blocks away from me. We brought you in because you've had some pretty interesting takes on shale EO are and you have a really good high level perspective on this. And also you get right into the weeds whenever I see you speak on this. So this has been a hot topic since 2016, I believe since EOG first broke the news that it was doing Huff and Puff gas injections ever since everybody's been captivated by this topic. What is what is your take on this? It's 2020. Where are we now with shale? You are, you know, since since 2016, I think that was kind of the first pivoting moment when when you presented this this the semester slides on the topic. But but since then you seen a lot of things happening, but it's been happening a little bit slow, I think for at least for a lot of the audience. But things is definitely happening in, you know, in the Eagle Fort you have a EOG, you have EP Marathon, Conco Phillips, Murphy, and so forth doing piloting and projects throughout the Eagle Fort. But you also have things going on in the Permian with Oxy, Chevron, these other basins with with, you know, Continental in the Scoop Stack, Liberty in the Bakken and so forth. So I think things is happening for people working on the topic. And I think probably also in the industry, people like yourself as well think it might be moving a little bit slower than what we initially hoped. You know, I've been working on this probably since 2016 in all these different places. And I'm kind of, you know, not disappointed, but a little bit, you know, pull set up from the fact that, you know, it's been taking four years from 2016 and we haven't seen more than maybe 200 wells tested so far. And hopefully in the next five years, we'll see, you know, a quadrupling maybe of that. I think what's interesting is you speak to the impatience and as we were talking before we came on it, you know, sort of as a reporter, as a journalist covering the industry, it has been an exciting but also sort of frustrating topic. And I was saying that, you know, generally, I've only found myself doing like one big, you know, kind of in-depth feature on this topic a year at most because the information doesn't come out so much and there isn't a lot of progress. And I'm wondering in part, is that because we're so spoiled on the fast-moving, you know, ship that is the U.S. Shale Revolution, even though it's kind of hitting rocky waters to keep the analogy going, but we're spoiled with a really fast-moving sector and then yet EOR is stuck in R&D phase for four years going on five. That's spot on essentially. That's the same. That's how I view the situation as well. You know, I, but again, I think it's important to acknowledge that things are really happening. You know, it's not only on the research level. It's not only Huff and Puff. You know, there's also all these other things that's happening with jewelry being put down whole with interesting completion schemes. You know, they call it, you know, type of fracture technology where they try to inject in every other fracture, for instance. You have, for instance, you know, surfactants added to the injection gas to, you know, decrease the mobility of the injection gas for conformance issues. So things are moving in the right direction and I'm very sure that we're going to get there pretty soon. I think, yeah, it will be interesting to see the next few years whether or not it's going to take off or not. What are some of the big things we've learned that may be helpful to help people sort of understand the nuances here, the context that you're giving? You know, are there, have we held on generally as observers to misconceptions about this practice and that's why a lot of people are saying, well, why don't they scale up? Why don't they move faster, these pilots? And then when you hear somebody from maybe EMP, EP talk about it, you realize, whoa, this is a lot harder than it seems on the face of it. I mean, these pilots are not straightforward. Yeah, and that's true. And I think, you know, what they've underestimated so far is how much gas you actually need to inject into these pilots. Draw me a picture there. Just to take you an example, you know, some of the pilots that they've been conducting in the Bakken, you know, they're injecting a few million scuffs per day. While the successful cases that we've seen in the Eagle 4, they're injecting, you know, 15 million scuffs per day. That's an order of magnitude and increase. And that's what you've seen that is required to get any type of economical uplift or any uplift at all, actually. So that's one part of the things that I think has been surprising for a lot of people. And I think the thing that has to probably increase in terms of orders of magnitude when it comes to the operational side is how much gas you can inject. I always draw the analogy to the early days when we started hydraulic fracturing that you, you know, you completed a well with 10 stages. And now we're talking, if you count the number of clusters in a lateral, it might be 200. So you need to get the same order of magnitude increase also in terms of how much gas you inject in these pilots. That's the first thing. The second thing is that you have to deal with this conformance issue that seems to be an issue everywhere. Are those two related, the amount of gas and the conformance? Yes. So you can say like, conformance is essentially, you know, how much of the gas that you inject into the well bore is leaking out into all the well bore surrounding the pilot, right? To this day, the reservoir, at least from all the people I speak to, from all the pilots I've been analyzing and so forth, every single pilot, whether or not it's the Eagle Ford, it is the Bakken or what not, you see the wells are communicating down hole. That's also related to this entire, you know, well spacing issue and so forth. And the fact that they're communicating isn't necessarily negative, but you have to be able to repressurize the reservoir. And if all the gas is leaking out to all the wells that might be producing, you won't be able to pressurize that system. So I think there's two things that has been surprising for a lot of people is actually how much gas you need to make it economical and the degree of how much they're struggling with these conformance issues. The way I have seen they've solved that practically, it's very simple, is that they essentially inject gas at very, very high rates, maybe into one well bore where they have a pad with between eight to maybe 16 wells. And then they see that all the offset wells are starting to pressurize up. And once they pressurize, they start to shut in the offset wells. And when the offset wells are shut in, they keep on doing that until you don't see any conformance issues or any type of communication down hole on the wells that are even further away from the injection. Is this typically just on a pad or are you seeing cases where it's pad to pad? So we're talking about long distance conformance issues there. Yeah, so you definitely see that as well. And a little bit of the problem is that around an injection pad, you don't necessarily, you don't own the neighbor pad sometimes, right? Right. And if you, you know, I have to give a big shout out to Hess actually that if you look at what they delivered and are going to start now in end of the year, I think up in the Bakken, they're actually owning the pad and the lease or the DSU as they call it up there. And all the lease is also around the injection pad. And that's very good because even if some of the gas is leaking out, you at least own the offset land so you're able to monitor it. You know, you actually get the gas back or there's actually someone else, if that wasn't the case, someone else would actually make money of the gas you were injecting. That's interesting because it also suggests it's a very interesting thing. It also suggests it's sort of to me, it says that you need to be somewhat of a medium, mid cap to a super independent here to really play in this space much because of such of these kind of considerations, which is that if you're up in the Bakken or the Eagleford, you know, you have natural fractures, you have induced frac hits that are long lasting and you still don't have an x-ray vision of the field. So it's sort of this practice that you have to have. Yeah, I think that's, you know, it's not only the bigger players, you need a lot of continuous acreage. I think that's key. The second thing is that you also it's very beneficial if you own the pipeline infrastructure on surface. This was the big advance for EOG, which was which I've been told, you know, during when when times got lean, they didn't sell their midstream infrastructure. And that's why they're able to supply themselves with that much gas. So that's a huge bottleneck in itself. Yeah, not only on the commercial side, you know, you can utilize the gas better and and and what not. But it's also on the logistical side, because if you have to depend on third party, you know, gas suppliers and renegotiate contracts and marketing contracts and these things every time you want to inject in a well. And sometimes you don't know how much gas you need to inject or for how long it will take until you build up that pressure. And and and many, many times you have you have some kind of target pressure, which is in general, you want to go as high as you can when it comes to this this bottom pressure and building up that pressure until until typically some safety factor of the of the fracture initiation pressure. Don't go over the frac gradient. You don't want to refract these wells. You want to maintain the the conductivity as it is. Yeah. And sometimes it's actually regulated by the local government. So so you're not allowed to, which is the case in, for instance, Canada. But but yeah, that's that's essentially that. One piece of advice has been given out by practitioners here is if you're going to try to get through this pilot process and deal with all these uncertainties that we've just covered, do it on an unbounded sort of the the the first well on the pad, you know, the H one well that doesn't have anything near it for half a mile or whatever. Does that does that speak to you? I mean, that way you would get that that first contact, you'd be able to sort of like run the economics a little bit better and run a pilot quicker. Does that make sense to you? Yeah, definitely. And I see, you know, some some of the companies that want to do the these pilots, they they go for these big lease DSUs where they inject a lot of gas and all the wells are communicating. Here we can talk like 25 wells could communicate when it starts. And at that end, that's bad news. Yeah, because the reason why it's bad is it's very hard to quantify. You know, then it's like, yeah, what wells are you actually going to include when you're going to provide a baseline for forecasts because you always have to compare it to, you know, whatever these wells are going to produce anyway. Right. But if you have an unbounded case with with also very good metering, you know, top side, it's much easier to first of all, provide a bench, you know, a benchmark for for future future production. And you don't get this kind of a noise from all these offset wells. And in addition, you will be, you know, you should expect to have a much better pressure buildup, which is also good for for testing out the scheme in more controlled environments. Is the data also cleaner for modeling from that point on as well, too? Yeah, for sure. So for modeling as well, you know, many times these wells are allocated, so you don't actually have necessarily super good resolution on your measured data for every single well. So there are some of these uncertainties that you kind of ignore if you do it on an unbounded well. And it's also cheaper because you don't have to inject that much gas since there's only one well that you need to inject into. OK, we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come right back to this topic and some other things. SPE is now accepting nominations for outstanding work in the E&P industry. Take a moment to help nominate your colleagues for the recognition they deserve. The International Awards deadline is 15th of February and the Regional Awards deadline is the 1st of March. For more information, visit SPE.org. awards or click the link in the show notes. So, Matias, I wanted to ask you a couple more questions about EOR before we move on. One of them that's come up in my reporting and I wanted to see if this squares with you is that when we talk about Shale EOR, another roadblock here to sort of the scalability of this practice is that this isn't the core practice of the Shale sector. This is a drilling complete world that we live here in the lower 48 and this is being said a lot from the podium including Tom Blasingame, the next president of the SPE in 2021, who said, you know, the Shale industry needs a lot more reservoir engineers. And when you look at Shale EOR, this is very much a reservoir engineering specific domain. Does the industry, does the sector have enough accrued experience and talent in that area to move faster? Is that an issue, a bottleneck? Yeah, that's definitely, I think what you said there, what Thomas said earlier and, you know, it's also something I get from kind of the community of reservoir engineers that's out there that this requires, you know, something else. It requires, you know, modeling, research on a topic and so forth, which, you know, might not have been the, you know, the name of the game at least initially in the Shale space. But also back to what we talked about earlier, you need the players that can actually have the scale, the infrastructure, and especially the gas volumes to carry this out. So, and if you look at the companies that actually have a lot of reservoir engineers, they're typically the bigger players as well. And you definitely have seen a change that, at least from my perspective, where these companies are recruiting more and more people with, you know, detailed and long lasting reservoir engineering experience. Well, I presented sort of our review of our findings to an SBE group last year about this topic and I got called out during the Q&A session because I didn't mention, you know, CO2 flooding and I didn't mention what you can do surfactants. So to please, you know, sort of that crowd, let's move away from Huff and Puff just for a minute. And what is happening on the surfactant front and the CO2 front? We hear a lot less. And then even in Canada, people are talking about, you know, just using, you know, liquids for Shale UR. So how are these things going? Yeah, so I think that's a very good point. So for CO2, it's fairly simple because no matter what you want to do, whether it's CO2, liquids or surfactants, volume is key. You need the scale. And, you know, when it comes to CO2, these contracts, like I talked to people talking about CO2 and it's like, yeah, we can do all this stuff. We can do these experiments. We can do the simulation with CO2. But, you know, if you go out and ask your marketing folks, you won't be able to get CO2 the next 10 years. So CO2 is kind of like the privilege of a few players that has that and have had that historically, namely being Oxi and similar companies like that in the Permian. Surfactants is something, again, that you need a lot of scale. But, you know, I've seen it, you know, or surfactants is actually, you know, I'm going to be honest now because surfactants is one of the things that you always hear about at these forums. And it's a lot of like papers about it. There's a lot of sales pitches about it. But there's tons of skepticism, let's be honest, for years. For years. And so I'm like, at least what we usually say is like, okay, surfactants has never worked really commercially for, you know, conventional reservoirs. But the other side is that people have a hard time proving that it worked. Right. I mean, so, yeah. So you sound like you're on the fence here. Yeah, a little bit. But I'm not going to bash too much on surfactants. But liquids in Canada is extremely interesting. And then, again, it's like water injection mainly that I've seen. There is some really, really exciting technologies out there, especially from I think a service company called NCS has been completing some of these wells that you can actually isolate every other stage or fracture for water injection and water production such that you get this more flood-based mechanism that is what you typically have been conducting in conventionals. And you're talking about inflow control devices. Yeah, essentially inflow control devices. And that's been extremely exciting to see some of the results there early, been presented at different forums and whatnot. Looks very promising. And again, but it's water. And again, you need scale. And if you think about how much water you use to fracture these wells, which is like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of barrels to fracture one well, you need the same type of volume and scale if you should be able to do some kind of EOR. So just to sum up, I think key no matter what you want to do, EOR, scale is important. And then you need to look at what's the most costly or cost efficient, so what you have the most available close to your pad that you can put down to any well more. And typically that's natural gas, associated gas, and water. So the horizon for these things is pretty long. I mean, you were talking about you'll be excited to see what happens in Huff and Puff in the next five years. Some of these might have a longer horizon for scale. But last question on this, and I've asked this and other people have asked me this, will the shale sector ever get to a point where it's designing the initial completion, the initial drilling design on or to prepare for EOR or as I said earlier, will it always remain a DNC world? EOR will have to learn how to live in it. It's going to be a combination but I've already seen actually a couple of companies that are starting to design pads with EOR in mind. That means bigger well to well spacing. It's also to make sure that the high pressure gas pipelines are going, are built close to the pads themselves because you don't want to have pipelines with 10,000 PSI pressure going across land where people live and where cows are being fed and whatnot. So I definitely see that's actually an increasing trend that I've seen very, very early in the beginning and that I'll expect to see much more of in the future. But that said, you have 100,000 wells or whatever we have out there drilled horizontally that is not built with the gas EOR in mind. What should you do about that? What should you do about the gas EOR in mind? What should you do about those? You can't just leave them be because they actually have a lot of more oil left in them and now it's the challenge of trying to make that or recover that economically. Okay, we're going to take one more break and then come back and explain with oil separator shrinkages. I know everybody wants to know and you're going to find out. SPE members get up to a 50% discount in the SPE bookstore. Visit store.spe.org to look for more information on the material and watch out for SPE's new book, Hydraulic Fracturing Fundamentals and Advancement. Authors will be on site at the hydraulic fracturing conference in the Woodlands for book signings. All right, so we're back. Matias, this is the last thing I wanted to get you to speak with us about and I found it pretty interesting. It is sort of wonky. It does take you into the weeds and you're going to have to get used to it. But if we were at the dinner table and I'm your great aunt, Lucy, how would you explain what oil separator shrinkage is? So the simplest way of explaining oil separator shrinkage is essentially that all these oil and gas wells that we're producing from, where they are actually measured, so where they have a measuring tool just as the same as you would measure how much water is in your kitchen equipment at well head. So the oil is run at what's called separator conditions typically at well head. And the pressure and temperature at those separators are higher than where you sell the oil and gas products. So from the separator conditions down to what's called stock tank conditions, your oil will shrink and some of the gas will come out of solution, which will have a big impact on economics, right, because you would like that shrinkage to be as low as possible so such that you can sell more oil because oil is worth more than gas in all of these places. Okay. So you did a study on this. This was the paper I saw you present in IPTC last week in Deirhan, Saudi Arabia. And one of the, I guess at a high level, the big number that you threw out in the paper is that as a consequence of this phenomena, this issue, an oil company, an operator could overestimate the amount of oil they're producing on a lease or on a well by up to 20%. And so that's actually a huge percentage there. Yeah, and the funny thing there is it's not only like the uncertainty in your forecast, but this is actually data that you have measured and that you just, you haven't accounted for separator oil shrinkage. So what we see a lot is essentially, and that paper was just built on a lot of practical kind of pragmatic observations that we made, where the first one was for all these companies we work with in North America, which is like 25 plus companies, we've seen that almost everywhere people ignore separator shrinkage when they actually do history matching and call it well performance analysis. That means that potentially I've seen shrinkage factors being 50%. That means that if you think that your oil is producing a thousand barrels per day, you're actually just producing 500. And that's largely because shale oil, if you will, the oil is producing, if you will, we talk about the volatile black oil window all the time. It really is volatile. I mean, you take it out of the ground and it's degassing, things are coming out of solution, so that's adding pressure and that's increasing the volume that you think is in there through the flow meter. So yeah, so there's two things there that's important and you're on to it. The first is the fluid type is very important. So like shrinkage and changes in shrinkage over time is expected to be larger for fluids that has more gas in solution. So that's volatile oils, that's nair critical fluids, gas condensates and lean gas condensates. Yeah. And the second thing is actually the actual temperature and pressure of these separators. And they can change a lot over the lifetime of a well. And if they, especially if the pressure is high and the temperature is low, you can get very, very high shrinkages. And what I'm trying to say is the other thing is also that, as I said, they can change a lot through time. And typically what you see is that the temperature changes with the seasons. So when it's hot in Texas during the summer, the temperature is higher than during the winter and maybe even bigger changes you can see in up north in Bakken and parts of Canada. You put up a chart actually during the presentation showing the seasonal differences and it was clear as day. You could see on the summer it's up and then in the winter it goes down. Yeah, and that's something you see mostly for all these wells. Well, the pressure typically is high in the beginning and then it decreases together with the bottom hole pressure. And again, what's unique by these shale reservoirs is that your bottom hole pressure, the pressure that actually gives the well potential to flow, decreases much, much faster than what you see in conventional reservoirs. You know, in conventional reservoirs you can have a constant pressure boundary so you can produce that constant pressure forever. Well, here your bottom hole pressure drops like a rock, on day one and you produce almost all the potential of your well the first two years. And then for a long period of time this pressure is constant and the separator pressure is kind of not mimicking that, but you see the same trend in the separator pressure. So the other thing about that is that your separator shrinkage factor can actually change significantly over time. While people, if they apply shrinkage factors at all, they typically apply it to be a constant factor for all the wells throughout the field. Right, so they're taking one data point that was, you know, derived years ago probably based on, you know, a few initial wells in the field. But we've seen, I remember we were at a presentation, the one we were talking about in Florida, where, I forget who it was, but it was a great picture and he showed jugs of oil samples in the Eagleford on the back of a F-150 and they were all taken within about a few miles of each other and they were radically different. I mean, you don't need to be an expert at all to see that the API gravities were totally different across these wells and they spatially, they weren't that far apart and so a company would be more inclined under the traditional sort of system here to just apply one shrinkage factor to all of those even though clearly these oil wells have different compositions. Typically the shrinkage factor is just a measurement that, you know, you take a fluid, a separator oil, you give it to some kind of laboratory and they do a very simple flash experiment to talk to any conditions and you get the shrinkage factor. And that shrinkage factor is something they apply constant for an entire field of region which is extremely dangerous considering that all of these wells are typically different. That's what's unique with these shale basins. You have everything from dry gas to near critical fluids and black oils where the shrinkage issue is probably the biggest in the near critical to gas constate region. And the second thing is that, you know, things like API, API and GORs and all these things, so the producing API and the producing GORs are changing throughout time. It's sort of the hot topic a couple of years ago was the GOR rising in the Permian. It's not going away but it sort of caught people by surprise. If you, like even if you meter these rates and you've done all your work perfectly, if you don't account for those changes, you know, even on the, you know, it's kind of crazy to me, you know, even data points where you have measurements, you're still off by up to 20%, sometimes even 50 if you don't account for it. And, you know, that's an important thing, you know, that's in a world where you at least think that you've done everything correctly. And kind of the bad news about it is that typically if you ignore it, you will just disappoint your manager in the, you know, throughout these organizations. So maybe that's why people are not talking too much about it. But just to hit it home, you know, so we talked about that high level number. You could be overestimating oil production by 20%, but this, you know, at some point these missing barrels get accounted for, right? And so that's usually at the sales level, right? So, you know, you know, the sales level is where the information is going to be sent to the barrels. So you know, that's where the information is going to be sent to the barrels in. So this issue comes home to the roost once somebody discovers it, but there's information siloing happening and then there's sort of a broad application of this shrinkage factor that needs to be customized and then optimized over time, right? So what happens to these missing barrels when somebody realizes that maybe this lease wasn't producing that? So, you know, typically where they're going to account for it while they're doing forecasting on the history match, for instance, a well using the separator barrels, then they'll think that their well is much more productive than what it really is. Well, you know, again back to the siloing is that, you know, maybe operationally and practically it's not an issue because the marketing guys, they get, you know, a million dollars for what they sell and they have to allocate it back to the wells and then they just use some simple factors. But the main issue is if a reservoir engineer has thought that this region is much more prolific than it really is and it gives away all these forecasts to develop this acreage and then you realize that you might be, you know, 20% or more off. You framed up the problem pretty well here and it is, I mean, I think for anybody listening, it does take you down into the weeds. It shows you how complicated these wells are, you know, that you have to take into account how your separator works. You have to take into account how it works on Monday, on Friday, and January, and in August. And so, you know, to tie all this up, you at Whitsun and the researchers and your cadre of clients, of shale producers, you guys have figured out a model that helps me, do I have to go and tweak my reservoir and check the meter every single day? What's the solution? Oh, yeah, so the solution is actually very simple and you don't need any other data than what you already have. You know, the data you just pull up the separator temperature and pressure from your SCADA system, which at least all the clients that we work for have that. So that's readily available. There's a few that don't have SCADA, but, you know, most do these things. Yeah, most of them. And so you pull that data off the separator meters and then you have a more sophisticated model called a so-called equation of state model that describes all the fluids throughout an entire basin and you use those two data points together with the production data to essentially calculate shrinkage factors on a daily basis. So that's something that's been successfully done, you know, many, many places in all the place. But it's just the, I think the biggest issue is the awareness and even when I did the presentation last week, you know, there was those people coming up to me after the presentation also when they asked the questions that, you know, these are good reminders for us because, you know, these things is typical things we don't think about, but can lead to biases and actually huge differences. And just actually trying to loop this back to what we talked about earlier with the gas EUR topic is, you know, when you do for instance gas huff and puff and you inject for a period of time and then you produce back, then essentially what's happening in that 30-day period when you produce is that your bottom hole pressure is decreasing very rapidly again. And then you have to do the same thing again. You have injected gas, so essentially the fluid composition that you're producing back is also changing rapidly. So you essentially get this entire lifetime or the changes that you think would happen in the lifetime of a well happens in 30 days. So it, like these issues with shrinkage, these issues with, you know, compositional changes and stuff like that, you know, it's put up a couple of orders of magnitude when you do gas EUR. So if it is one place that's really important to take it into consideration, then that's what you're going to see when you do this gas EUR project. Just to wrap up here, because you've given us a lot to think about, how did this problem or this issue come into your view? Was this you being pulled by your operator clien"

Tarek, Akos, Barasha and Gabriel, welcome to this SBE Live. Welcome. Hello. Hello, everyone. Hi. Hello. Hello. All right. So we start with this exciting event. And Akos, we'll start with you. You have worked across various domains in production engineering, varying from generalist role to specialization in artificial lift designs. Do you consider yourself a generalist or a specialist? Yeah, thank you very much for the question. And also welcome everyone from my side. Thanks for the invitation. So the short answer would be currently I consider myself as a generalist. I started as a specialist when I started my career because the idea was that I will be trained and I will develop myself into a stimulation expert. Because in one of our companies in OMB Petrom there are just so many great technical jobs. They really did multilateral, multistage, high pressure stimulation jobs. They did multistage, refract jobs, frac-packs, home acidizing jobs, just to mention a couple of these exciting jobs. But I have to admit that at the time when I would have come to the point to join the team, the need from the company really changed. And then there was a need more for being a generalist. And then I started to deal with more work over planning, well-intervention planning, artificial lift system designs and so on. So basically the company needs also changed my career path. And currently I would consider myself as a generalist. What I would also highlight is just the importance of hands-on experience, regardless which career path you choose or regardless of your career path. Regardless which career path you choose or regardless to which group you belong to. What's really important really is be open for the other discipline. And then you can easily change from one or the other. Because if you have really been there, seen that, done that, then you would be able to contribute to each discipline. So that's my point of view on that. Thank you so much. That was a great overview. Barsha, welcome next to you. You have such an extensive research experience in the field of flow assurance. This is a niche field. What prompted you to choose a research-oriented career? Hello, everyone. First of all, a huge thanks to SB International for the recognition of Energy Influencer 2023 and also for giving us this platform to share our views. I am associated with the flow assurance research area since last eight years and I have extensively performed research work in developing chemical additives for waste deposition prevention and gas headed formation prevention during pipeline transportation. In the mature fields, due to enhanced oil recovery operations, the water flooding causes increase of water fraction and subsequent water in oil emulsion formation that leads to complexity of the different flow assurance strategy that are implemented in the field. And also about two thirds of the world's daily oil production is coming from the mature field. Hence, the flow assurance plays an important role and that is what motivated me to do research in this area. Flow assurance is a niche field and it requires attention as one strategy or a single strategy may not be applicable for the production life from a well. I really enjoy working in this area as the development of different types of chemical additives also depends on the physicochemical properties of the crude oil, which varies from field to field. In the flow assurance area, one of the breakthrough research performed by my research team is the development of different types of quantum dots that we are using as low-dose hydrate inhibitors. And they are showing some great performance in the laboratory scale, but we are yet to test on some pilot scale or in the industry. And also currently I'm forming research to address the wax deposition and gas headed formation, combating simultaneously with some dual function inhibitors. Thank you. Okay, thank you. We'll come back to more questions. But next is Gabrielle. You have worked in completions technology in onshore and offshore fields and across multiple countries. Do you consider yourself a generalist or a specialist? And specifically, what advice you might have for listeners in making career choices? Thank you. Thank you for that question. Thank you for having us here today. I'd say based on my background and the jobs that I've done in the past and I currently do, I lean more on the specialist side in terms of stimulation and completion. But I do want to mention, and I'm sure all of you have heard that sentence, you know, being a jack of all trades and the master of none. And in this case is, you know, balancing the generalist versus specialist outlook. Back in the past, I had experience in Europe working in an integrated project to understand how important it was of what the input is and what the output is to what you're actually doing. So if you're in stimulation, essentially you do want to talk to the drilling team. You do want to talk to the geology team, to the reservoir engineers, to the production engineers themselves, you know, as Akush mentioned earlier on the artificial lift side. So understanding the full picture in order to do your job better. So you can be a specialist, but it's super important to understand what are the ins and outs of what you're doing in order to increase the efficiency actually of what you're delivering to a project or to the company itself. In terms of career and advice, I've been saying this in the past and I stand by it. I think it's super important to do what you like and enjoy. You probably have heard this a lot of times, but it seriously is like that. If you enjoy having hands-on experience, you should pursue a position like that, maybe with service companies out there. If you enjoy theory, research, working PhD projects, R&D departments of the companies, you can pursue that. Essentially, it's all open. At this point in time, oil and gas and geothermal energy and all other forms of energy, there's a lot of opportunities out there. I think just diversify your portfolio. Try not to be a super specialist in one thing without having to understand the bigger picture and pick something that actually drives you, drives you to go to work or essentially work at it virtually. So yeah, that would be my two cents. Thank you. That was great advice. Tarek, we have you next. You have worked extensively in CFD as well as with specialized applications in heavy oil fields, diverse applications in AC design and building management. This is an excellent example of applications of a super specialty skill set across various disciplines. What advice do you have for our listeners when making career choices as a specialist or as a generalist? Yeah, thank you very much for having me. Thank you very much. Thank you. It's a very good question, actually. And simply my answer will be I would advise our listeners to follow their passion at the same time to keep an eye on the evolving job market. So when you when you when you're choosing between being a specialist or a generalist, it's important to consider what truly exciting you. If you have a deep interest in a particular field or domain, especially can be specialist or specializing can be incredibly rewarding, enabling you to become an expert in that area, making a significant impact and potentially enjoy and more focused in forthcoming career. On the other hand, if you if you if you have a broad range of interest and enjoying learning and adapting to different challenges, being a journalist might be the right choice. Generalists often thrive in dynamic and multidisciplinary disciplinary environment where they can apply their skills across various domains and take it and take on diverse rules. For example, I would like to talk about myself, for example, I made my decision to pursue academic career and focusing on field engineering, notably in mechanical engineering, because I believe research and development in this area will address critical needs in my country back home in Gaza and Palestine, enhancing the prospect of industry and thus affect the everyday lives of people. So so this perspective, it was it was always at the forefront of my career. And this is what motivates me because I realize that only education and knowledge and experts could change the shape of my homeland country. Quite Nelson Mandela said education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. End of the end of the coat. So know that. Inspiring people to learn in a positive and open minded could be a huge step towards minimizing the gap between culture, countries and trade. Talking about the second point, keeping an eye on the evolving job market, the domain or for or the demand for specialists can can vary from country to country. And I on the evolving job market that the domain or for or the demand for specialists can can vary depend on industrial trends and technological advancement. It's essential to stay informed about the job opportunity, about the industrial trend and technology advancement and to end and to end to assist. How your skill align with these opportunities lately or lastly, the decision of pursue the PhD for jobs in oil and gas industry or any industry for matter form for that matter should be well thought out. A PhD can open doors to specialized role and research position, but it is it is assessed. A substantial commitment in terms of time and effort. It is essential to wait. The benefit of a PhD against your career goals and specific requirement of the industry you want to enter seek seek advice from professionals in your choosing field and consider the potential return on investment for a PhD. The key is to enjoy what you do and continue learning and growing in your choosing path. Thanks. Thank you. At this point, we would encourage our audience to ask questions. We have our great influencers. So please go ahead and type your questions. But if not, we have a lot of questions for you. So, of course, we'll probably come back to you. How does the discussion of the generalist versus specialist career path differ in the context of energy transition? Yeah, I believe there is not so much difference, to be honest, compared to the core business, also the really core, hardcore gas business. So you would still need both right. I mean, you would need specialist. If you think about your energy, you might want to have, you know, team members who are really professionals in ESP designs and selection and so on. And then you will still need the generous people. So in my point of view, it doesn't differ too much. Yeah, you need both as always. We have an excellent question from audience. What is required to become a TWA energy influencer? We are inspired by all of you. I would like to know the answer to this. And maybe we can just start with Barasha and we'll go in the order. OK, so yeah, this is a very inspiring thing for us also when we were nominated for TWA energy influencer. I especially didn't expect to get it because, you know, my aim was not to get any award or recognition like that. I especially work in the oil and gas industry just to inspire the young professionals or my students so that they can become future employees or professional in some oil and gas companies and can, you know, take the legacy of the organizations that they are giving to us, all of us. They are, you know, fulfilling the energy supply, energy demand of all the world, of all the people in the world. So basically just work for the industry, just to be associated with ESP, get involved in different oil and gas tasks and whatever the ESP is providing with us. Then you can become an energy influencer next year. That's very candid. Gabriel, what's your journey? That's a great question. The answer could be very subjective and in a million ways. I would say do good work. By that I mean whether that's at your job, whether that's at the university, whether that is in your community, do something that you truly want to. And when it comes back to education, to echo a little bit Tarek's message, it's education doesn't have to be just a four year degree. It could just be you signing up for a course online, you wanting to change something about yourself. The moment you want to change something about yourself is the moment you start affecting people around you in a positive way. Right. And once that effect takes place, you know, start inspiring people and maybe, you know, they see an example in UNI, and wanting to make a change in their life for the positive, for the better. Right. So to become a TW influencer, I'd like to thank my nominator for being here today and for being chosen for that. But I would like to leave everyone with this message in terms of this question is that in order to inspire others, you have to do work that inspires you. Because without that, without that drive, you won't be able to affect others in the community around you. Thank you. I'll pause. We'll change the question, change gear back to this event again. So the next question from our guest, from our audience, Sani Abdullah Ahmed is what are the pros and cons of generalists and specialists? Maybe we'll go to Akos back to you on this question. Yeah, I believe, you know, the pros of being a specialist is simply, you know, you ultimately become the number one expert in some fields. So if there is a need for it, you will be the first one who will be contacted. And this is also basically at the same time, the disadvantage, because, you know, if there is no need for that special knowledge, you might be placed on the on the side. So I think it's an opportunity and a risk at the same time. And if you think about being a generalist, then you will have you will develop broad knowledge on different disciplines. So this could be universally used and then you will always find an opportunity. But again, when it comes to something really specific, you might not be the one who would be selected. So I think this that summarizes somehow. Thank you. We have our next question from Ina. And the question maybe this may be for Tariq. In the future, do you believe that companies will place a greater emphasis on seeking specialists or generalists? And I ask this special specifically to you because you have a PhD. And so there must be some decision making when you chose your PhD path. Oh, yeah. Thank you. It's a hard question, honestly. I would say it's really hard to know what the future office is looking for. And in general, if you are talking about oil and gas market, and especially I would like to talk here about Canada, for example, the oil and gas, it's not stable, unfortunately. So this year maybe they are looking for people who are specialists. The next year, maybe they might lay them off. The year after, they might looking for a generalist, junior people even sometimes and so on. So it's always about you need to you need to keep tracking the market. You need to tracking what the market is looking for. In my opinion, I would always suggest that always keep an eye. Don't put yourself in a corner. Even if you are a specialist, always try to keep development and keep in touch with other applications and fields. And here, when you did the introduction, for example, yes, I'm a specialist in the CFD, but I'm still, for example, working in a different areas like water, water desalination, like oil and gas, like HVAC systems, like nuclear applications. And recently I'm looking for working in biomedical applications. So try not to put yourself in a corner because talking again about oil and gas, it's really the market changing. And you don't want to be in a position that you are sticking in just a corner and you cannot find any other opportunity. So just try to be active and try to be also one of my advice to everyone here. Also try to be involved in societies like, for example, SPE society. It's always a very good society to keep you in it working and to keep you involved in a lot of what's, for example, what the technology is up to date, what's the company they are looking for and so on. And this will draw your path for being a specialist or even journalist. Thank you. It is the right card, I would say. Gabriel, the next question is for you. And because you have been involved in so much of mentoring, I think you'll probably be able to give more light on this. This is a question from Laura Rios. Do you think it is natural that new graduates feel the need to become specialists before they can migrate to a more generalist role? Thank you for that question, Laura. Yeah, in a sense, I do believe it would be a positive thing to start as a specialist in a certain domain because of one concept. And that concept is competition. So if you start off as a generalist, and this is my opinion, is the competition pool is a lot bigger. While it is fun to compete with others, I think it could become a little more challenging to get the job that you're actually shooting for. So starting off as a specialist in one domain and becoming good at it and then expanding and learning other concepts along the path, I think would be, in my eyes, the most, let's say, efficient way of educating and enhancing your skills in your career. And then tied to that, now that you mentioned it, Indira, you talked about mentoring. I cannot stress enough how important that is. It's finding someone out there that can share their perspective with you, whether that's job-related, life-related, society and community-related. Ask the questions. Go out there and ask for help. Rarely will someone say, hey, you know, don't bother me with questions. So try to find somebody that can give you some guidance in your choices and not make the decisions for you, because nobody can do that. But they can show you perspectives of what kind of decisions you could make. And then you make your own decisions and bear the consequences of them. But at least you have a bigger picture of what's out there in terms of your career choices. Great. And actually, we'll keep you on the screen because the next question, I think, is an extension to this previous question. It's from Sani Abdulahi Ahmed. One starts as a specialist, obviously. At what point do you start becoming a generalist? That is a very good question. I think that's also very subjective. And it depends on the type of job you do. If I tell you to my experience, I think it took me about three years doing the fieldwork that I did in stimulation to feel that I was competent enough to run jobs by myself and then start branching out in different areas. So it depends on what you do. It depends on the timing, because time is a relative thing. What I can do in three years, maybe somebody can do in two. Right. So don't take that as a hard yes or no. I think you will know yourself when you feel comfortable of what you're doing. You've got to keep growing in that domain because you're never really a specialist 100 percent. There's always something new. There's always some innovation. At that moment that you feel comfortable running the job by yourself and making your own decisions without having that fear, then I think it's time for you to start branching out and learning other domains that are closely related to what you do or that spark the interest. Great. Thank you. And the next question is actually for everyone. And Barsha, maybe we can start from your comments. This is from Linka Launa. The question is, how do you see the future of energy industry evolving in terms of technology and innovation? And what opportunities do you foresee for young professionals entering the field? So maybe you can start off with Barsha, you can start off with your fields specifically and then we can go around the table. Yes, yes. The point is that the future of the energy industry is evolving. Currently, we all are facing an energy transition phase. We all are in an energy transition phase right now. So but the point is that without having any fundamentals of the conventional oil and gas industry or the different operations that are currently ongoing, so we cannot move to energy transition. So basically, the future energy industry is evolving. But the most important inclusion is the part of digital digital inclusion, the application of artificial intelligence, the application of machine learning, then different development of different simulators. All these are, you know, the current requirement for the oil and gas industry in order to move forward. And the second part is the opportunities that we see for the young professionals. So the opportunities are huge. At present, we cannot deny the role of the conventional oil and gas in our current world. So we cannot move forward by leaving current oil and gas application in our day to day life. So we have to move forward with oil and gas. So the conventional application or the application of the digital part or the energy transition, all these are the fresh opportunities for the young professional at this moment. Great. And maybe Tarek, if you can answer the question as well. And then we can move to the last question after this. Yes. Go ahead, Tarek. Well, this is actually a really very big question because here we are talking about energy in general. So recently I was attending the WCP, the World Petroleum Congress in Calgary. And this was a question of that Congress. What energy or what's next? So most of people were mentioned that they are looking for now building or thinking about another way of providing energy in terms of using renewable energy, for example. So this market or this field actually is going to get bigger and bigger in Middle East, in America, in South America, and so on. So the people are trying now to build, for example, solar collectors. They try to use even hydrogen and so on. But continuing what my colleague just mentioned, that yes, people nowadays, they are looking for AI, for machine learning, for for computational modeling as well. And all of those things they are looking for, especially because sometimes the industry is looking for answers immediately without waiting for go to the field and do the experiment, for example. So those new technologies, it's going to help people to address and to get answers very fast and with pretty much low cost. I don't want to say zero cost with a very low cost. And this is at the moment, I think this is the key for the future is tracking the AI and the machine learning, I would say. Great. Thank you. There are more exciting questions, but unfortunately we hit our time limit. But I thank the panel for their excellent advice. I think my greatest takeaway for our audience is be true to yourself, follow your heart and keep your options open. Keep looking out. SP is a great platform to get involved, get yourself out there, ask for questions, ask for help. So with that note, I think we will thank you all and the audience for their excellent participation. I wish we had more time and ask all the questions we had. But this will be for today. So thank you, everyone. And thank you, SP, for this great opportunity for this discussion.

"SPE Live Podcast: O&G Powering Our Net Zero Future ‚ÄìWhere Are We, What Next?","I'm Jason Notouris and this is SPE Talks 2. Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SPE podcast. Maybe one of the last episodes coming from our homes could be going back to the office soon. Some restrictions are lifting across the globe, hoping all of you out there are able to keep safe and stay strong. Shana, how are you holding up and what are you seeing across the industry about the workforce potentially returning to the office? I'm so encouraged that companies are now either they've started or they are soon to implement ways to be slowly bringing back people to the office, albeit in different strategies. Some are looking at bringing people in on a rotating schedule such as okay team A is in the office Mondays and Wednesdays and team B is there Tuesdays and Thursdays or even determining which employees really don't need to be in the office and can continue to be working from home. But you know as we're slowly starting to return into offices and I know even too with the service providers I want to thank many of them too for continuing to do business while a lot of our lockdowns for example offering virtual teardown being able to instead of having to travel to a pump shop to witness a teardown that we can now actually do it virtually through long distance. But we're still trying to figure out a way to meet in person as a society through our events as well as our sections. But I guess with the silver lining some of our huge fundraising efforts they are already still continuing to occur because they already offer a sense of social distancing so we can still continue to provide much needed scholarship money to many of our student members. I have say I've been working on my golf game and I'm pretty pumped right now because I just had my first sporting clays lesson this morning. So I'm setting myself to participate and help generate some scholarship funds for those SBE events. Fascinating was it successful this morning? Let's just say that some clays felt their demise but then there were others that didn't. Those clays they can be elusive. For everyone who's not accustomed to it once a month we do bring in 2020 SBE President Shana Noonan to discuss her column. Her June column is strengthening our core disciplines. So when you have your ask the president questions at the end of your column and at the end of the podcast what type of feedback are you hearing from the members and from those who are listening? It's been very interesting and very broad with the type of feedback that I get and I do make a point of responding to every person that does send an email through the president at SBE.org. They don't come directly to me they actually get routed through an SBE staff member so if you're not seeing a response from me in a short period of time it's either because it hasn't been sent on to me or it could be a difficult question that I have to think about. Currently the one that I have yet to respond to is a very long-term SBE member who really thinks that SBE should have never gone international and that we would not be in the situation we're in now financially and as well as having to start offering all this virtual media if we had always remained an association within the United States. My personal opinion and this will pretty much be my response is you know our industry has no borders. We've benefited from the diversity whether it's cultural or geographical overall and I think one of the best things that could have happened to SBE was for us to go international because I believe that we are defined by all the disciplines that we have within our membership not by geographical borders and this really then leads into the theme of this last column which is actually it's the last of the five fundamental areas that I wanted to focus on as SBE president was strengthening our core disciplines. Shana what exactly do you mean by the core disciplines? Well I don't want people to take offense that these are preferential disciplines you know what I mean is the foundation of our patrolling engineering fundamentals that they're all within the core discipline drilling completions reservoir which definitely includes the geosciences and production operations because these disciplines which for the purposes of my presidency way I've defined as core disciplines they make up the bulk of coursework in most patrolling engineering degree programs as well as the content in the SBE engineering certification test and even still today most of our members can identify themselves as either being a drilling completions reservoir production engineer but yes there are so many other disciplines within our industry such as HSE management economic facilities and over time SBE has added content and programs covering topics outside of the core disciplines to encompass it all and our membership has grown as a result and you know let's be honest most of us work among multidisciplinary teams and collaborations that extend well beyond just these core disciplines so it made complete sense for SBE to adopt this expansion strategy and while we must continue to provide and welcome all disciplines and professions involved with producing the world's higher-to-carbons we must still deliver quality content and programs for fundamental petroleum engineering disciplines and these you know at the field level closest to the wellhead and just kind of a quick tangent here when I interned for mobile oil up in Canada I actually had a manager his name was Kevin Grondin who believed that you were not a true production engineer unless you went out at least hugged a wellhead each day superstitions are not just for baseball everyone so when you speak of this growth of SBE's 75,000 or so professional members they're all coming in from different disciplines but what does that demographic look like well in your member profiles and as an SBE member you can identify yourself with disciplines that we've laid out or if there is one there then you're just kind of stuck in a other category or none selected but I had the staff pull the 2019 membership and just to look to see how it looked the demographics looked by discipline still today two-thirds of our total professional membership with their primary discipline as being a core discipline now there's a chart that's in my column and people might be a little confused because they see drilling they'll see completions but then they'll see a category that's drilling and completions and what that is is that those that are still listed under a drilling and completions those are people that have not updated their SBE profile since they actually split the discipline into either drilling and completions and I highly recommend if you're one of those individuals that you do go in and update because and I'll give an example later in this podcast we're gonna start rolling out some exclusive content that is going to be tied with your primary discipline and it's going to either be drilling or completions but not drilling and completions. Now we've also redefined one of our traditional disciplines which used to be M&I management and information and the board of directors just recently redefined and relaunched it as the data science and engineering analytics and management discipline so again for those now that finally can list their primary discipline as a data science discipline within your SBE member profile I highly recommend you do that as well. Now as we continue to expand and welcome more disciplines as our industry changes and evolves but the one thing that I wanted to concentrate on was to ensure that we do not dilute the offerings and erode the value of being an SBE member for those in our core discipline and at the same time we need to ensure that these offerings are easily acceptable because many of the members in these core disciplines are at the field location and that typically they're at an age where they really need this knowledge transfer and just making sure we have ways to make sure that they're not only staying current and relevant but they're also getting the Do you think that there's a chance that this could be an issue though? Well so I started to do some homework. I had some suspicions when I was doing this article and this again was one of the reasons why I identified this as one of my five focus areas as SBE president. So the first thing I did was look at the JPT. I looked at the technical categories that were covered in JPT in the year 2000 and then compared it with today and really seen were we still delivering on those core disciplines and you know I was very pleased to see that yes through JPT we've expand its coverage into other disciplines without compromising articles and features focus on those core disciplines but hey it's a magazine and it's relatively easy because you can just add pages but inherently too that also adds to the cost of producing a printed venue. Now quick sidebar something I discovered when I was doing the research in OnePetro looking at the JPT articles that as an SBE member you can get in for free in OnePetro all the past JPT articles and synopsized papers for free if you're an SBE member and there's over 70 years worth in OnePetro and I actually had fun one weekend going back looking through past years and even some of the articles that appeared in the year 2000 a lot of it was still very relevant for today so I think that's a huge member benefit by the way that again as SBE president I didn't realize that was actually there so now I'm trying to get the message out to as many members as I can and then the next thing I did was do some research into ATCE. I compared the technical sessions from the year 2000 and 2020 and having served on the ATCE program committee in the past I know that there's a finite number of sessions available and sometimes it can be a bit contentious is a bit of a strong word but the drilling people need three sessions but the hydraulic fracturing need four you know it's a give-and-take and so this is where I was have a suspicion that there might have been some level of dilution and I actually found that there is approximately a 30% reduction in the sessions for reservoir and geosciences at ATCE when I looked at 2020 compared to 2000 but then when I started to do a little further digging you know I discovered that this decrease was not due to the encroachment of new disciplines coming in but it was primarily because of the increased activity into hydraulic fracturing and the doubling of sessions allotted for the completion discipline so again the core is still being addressed but the disciplines the disciplines within that core had changed over time so you know in reflection the ATCE program committees have done an amazing job of being able to include sessions of interest for a wide variety of disciplines while still serving the needs of our members in those core disciplines so I was very impressed. That's good research too it's good to be able to look back and do more than just look at the numbers but come to conclusions based on what we're seeing from the numbers. Let's take a quick break with that in our mind and we'll be back in just a moment. We're back with Shana Noonan 2020 SPE President. SPE has technical directors that oversee these disciplines and just to be fully transparent and clear Shana can you tell us about what the function of these directors is? I would love to because this is something that I want our members to realize not only who these individuals are but what they actually do in serving our members and I have a little personal twist to this because my first time on the SPE board of directors I myself was a technical director. I was the technical director of production and operations which at a board level doesn't exist on its own anymore it was merged with facilities so I guess well it wasn't myself it was actually Jennifer Miskimans who is the last P&O TD she came on after I did but okay so what then as TD what was our role? Well we service champions and have advisory resources to the board and all the different committees and the staff for their representative discipline in all SPE programs so as P&O technical director I was making sure that my discipline was well represented within events webinars JPT articles and so on and so forth and at the same time if there was moderation or questions within the P&O and SPE connect there is involvement from the TDs as well and then one of our roles is to encourage and promote coverage in order to do that you're not doing it by yourself each one of the TDs has their own advisory committees that they make sure are diverse in geographically as well as within all the little side disciplines within that discipline and if you want more information on it there's you can go to the explore your discipline section on SPE's website and since the TDs have been around since 2001 they played a vital role in maintaining our content for the core disciplines as SPE expands but also too we needed to rely on them strategically to tell us from a discipline perspective what is your discipline going to look the next five to ten years from now so then when we're setting forth our strategic plans we're also looking at it strategically at a discipline level and I really believe having those technical directors and making sure that on a discipline level we're delivering on that content it really increases the value of having an SPE membership and I'm really hearing that these individuals are very tapped into their discipline but beyond that being able to be strategic to enable SPE to succeed not only today but forecast for success in the future and setting their committees up for success as well. The technical directors are very highly respected and highly recognized people within their own discipline and let me mention two of them because I mentioned them in my article so last year I was approached by both our incoming and outgoing technical directors for drilling so Jeff Moss was rolling off the board and David Reed was coming on and they wanted to be able to demonstrate to the drilling community the value of having an SPE membership because they thought that they had some concerns at the time so they wanted to pilot a program that would provide exclusive content to our SPE members in the drilling discipline so working with SPE staff we started to collect feedback from the drilling engineering community as to what would need to be included in this program to really increase the value proposition of being an SPE member as a drilling engineer and this program now we've now coined them as engagement hubs and the pilot program was scheduled to launch by this summer but obviously we've had to allocate a lot of resources in other areas right now in response to the COVID pandemic and the reduction in our events but I'm still committed to see this through and I'm thankful that it looks like we're going to retain the funding for it and if this pilot is successful and by the way the only way you'd be able to be a part of the special content that's going to be delivered through this engagement hub is if you're an SPE member and we're actually trying to deliver a lot of it through the app because again we have so many programs that are out there that if you're willing to pay a little bit more money for it you can access it and not be an SPE member and I'm again really trying to focus on driving the value proposition for being an SPE member in the first place so I'm trying to drive a lot more exclusive content. As I hand over the gavel to Dr. Tom Blackingame I'm still on the board for another year and as outgoing making sure that a lot of my initiatives that I had started will actually be implemented by the time I finished my three-year term and so you know and I want to ensure that these offerings are accessible to the many core discipline members who are based in field locations. This is why we're looking at a lot of better and shorter content for them because as I mentioned these are members earlier in their career and they need these materials for their technical development and I can still relate to this because as a young rig supervisor now based in a remote town of Fox Creek Alberta if I even for me to attend a section meeting it was a two-hour drive into Edmonton and if those events were held in the winter it was a serious safety issue because of really poor road conditions and so even though I was an SPE member because I was out in a remote location there was a lot of content or events that were going on that were difficult for me but you know it's a whole different time right now we can deliver content and we have been through our website and our app being able to listen to and participate in not only sections but even for the bigger conferences the international events can be challenging if non-existent for those in field locations and offering virtual events is a way that we can actually drive value to those members and reach them and provide the education they need. It's always been our strategic plan to start offering some events in virtually in some manner and we did a pilot earlier this year at the International Hydraulic Fracturing Conference in the Woodlands out to several other sections we live stream the opening sessions just to prove out the platform and work out the glitches and little did we know then that just a few months later we would quickly have to expand our offerings in the virtual space to reach any of our members whether they're sitting at their dining room table like I am right now or close out to the wellhead. Shana part of that has been with the SPE live on the simulcast social media platforms where the discussions for the upcoming virtual event for oilfield scale we're talking about doing a live look in of that keynote panel where on SPE live on social media you will be able to kind of have a 10-minute preview of what it would be like to attend one of these virtual conferences at which time the simulcast stream will end and you'll be directed if you'd like to continue watching please go over to the event website and register. That's one element of the puzzle that we are figuring out and adapting to. To be honest I think going ahead our events are going to be hybrid they're going to be a mix of both they're going to be a mix of virtual as well as in-person and then even thinking a lot of our larger events too this is when we have our recognition ceremonies for our members you know how can we continue to do that and have a sense of satisfaction for those award winners you know it's kind of a virtual space versus in person and trying to handle all the social distancing we are figuring this out and we are having these more virtual events starting this year but I'm asking our members please not only be patient because this is a new space for SPE we really need your feedback because again we're a member-driven organization we need to have some these virtual offerings have to be of value to you and this is why we need your your feedback but I won't go too much more into that because we're going to delve a lot more next month in my column but I really believe that there is a silver lining in the space where we're now going to be able to reach out to those in field and well operations a lot more and they're going to be able to learn about the latest techniques faster and possibly find ways to network and find mentors in a virtual space with them not having to take necessarily time off of work if they can get it to come into some of the largest cities where these events are being held let's take a quick break with that in our mind and we'll be back in just a moment SPE is going virtual coming the 24th to the 26th of June the SPE International Oil Filled Scale Conference and exhibition will be a 100% online event you'll enjoy a high quality peer-reviewed technical program networking opportunities and an exhibition center join us in keeping our communities connected during this challenging time register today and access the event live from anywhere around the globe search SPE Oil Filled Scale in your web browser or click the link in the show notes of this episode from our home office to yours hope to see you there we're back with Shana Noonan 2020 SPE president as our industry evolves one could assume that there will continue to be as history has shown an emergence of more unique disciplines oh yeah they can be disciplines that aren't even on our radar yet but if that's that's the dynamics and the beauty of our industry and we need to continue to include those disciplines in our ever-growing family to solve our grand challenges and drive the innovation but we still have our fundamental core disciplines and after spending time looking at the data and talking with members and being able to start to create some programs like these engagement hubs for this core discipline I am confident that we can continue to keep expanding our reach while still delivering accessible quality content and programs on fundamental petroleum engineering and field operations Shana thank you so much the question of the month is next but first a reminder that the distinguished lecturers have gone virtual this season's DL's have recorded webinars available to all SPE members for free visit the DL website or web events dot SPE org to learn more links are in the show notes in coordination with Shana's column each month we also want to ask you the listener a question we'll even be addressing some of the responses on future podcasts so here we go the question of the month do you feel that SPE has maintained its level of content and programs for the core disciplines if not where are the gaps and how can we improve okay so we want to hear from you email your response to president at SPE org again that question is do you feel that SPE has maintained its level of content and programs for the core disciplines if not where are the gaps and how can we improve and then let's let's keep this conversation going to use the hashtag SPE podcast we want to hear from you on social media and interact with you there as well looking for the latest episodes you can search SPE podcast on Apple podcast pod bean or anywhere else you listen to your podcast please leave reviews we appreciate the five stars and hearing your feedback you can also find us online at SPE org slash podcast special thanks to this episode's guest 2020 SPE president Shana Noonan I'm Jason Notouris and thanks for listening SPE podcast is powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers the largest individual member organization serving managers engineers scientists and other professionals worldwide in the upstream segment of the oil and gas industry learn more at SPE org"
SPE Live Podcast: Generalist vs. Specialist: Winner Doesn‚Äôt Do It All!,"You're listening to SPE Talks Tech. I'm Paige McCowan, and today we're talking about the Drilling Systems Automation Roadmap with John DeWart. Welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us. I want to introduce my guest today, John DeWart. John is founder of DeWart & Company. He has nearly 45 years experience in the industry and is a well-published author, industry recognized consultant, and thought leader. Welcome, John. Thanks for joining me. Thank you. So John, today we're going to talk about the drilling, talk about drilling automation and the drilling systems automation roadmap and your program manager for the DSAR. Can you tell us about the roadmap and how it came about? What? So the drilling systems automation roadmap is a cross industry initiative which we launched back in 2013 with the aim to provide insights to industry participants and non-industry participants regarding the adoption and advancements of drilling systems automation, both onshore and offshore for oil and gas drilling. Three of us got together and launched it. After a couple of years, I ended up taking the role as program manager as we lost one of our founders and the other founder was heavily loaded with other things. We set about identifying what we classified as the best roadmap process and we discovered Sandia National Laboratories process. This is a process which they declassified and made available to the public and in fact, it's the definition in Wikipedia essentially. And it's used by many entities in developing their own roadmaps. So we adapted it for our own purposes. We then set up a steering committee of 14 members. We identified people with range of competencies to encompass the spectrum of expertise as we envisage we should be covering. As we progressed, we identified challenges. We initially had nine challenge topics and in order to develop the content of these nine challenge topics, we developed subgroups. And these subgroups were each led by a steering committee member and they reached out in totality to 50 experts globally. So this was essentially a virtual organization launched in 2013, operating through 2014, 2015 through these global subgroups. We held a series of workshops. Fortunately, IADC put these on with for us with their world drilling and IADC art conference. And this enabled us to test some of our ideas and get feedback from industry audiences. Then we held a major review workshop where we had 90 people present in January 2018. We had breakout groups working each of the challenges and giving us feedback as to what they endorsed, what they supported and where they thought there was further work to be done. Unfortunately, volunteering was not as quick as the other industry development of roadmaps. If we look at Department of Defense, they fund their roadmaps and they tend to go rather rapidly. Ours was going quite slowly and we needed to get it geared up a bit. And so we launched a joint industry project through IADC drilling engineering committee. We managed to raise $215,000 across from supporters across the industry. It was actually a small amount of money when you consider the estimated cost, excluding value of the expertise put in the roadmap, but of all the volunteer time and the funding from the JIP came to a total of $800,000. So essentially, running a roadmap like this is a million dollar operation and we managed to cover $215,000 of it from our supporters. Wow, that's amazing. A lot of volunteer time going into that. So how does it benefit the industry? So essentially, it provides a wide ranging comprehensive overview of the expected advancement in multiple aspects of drilling systems automation. And we are, we developed the roadmap with the intent to look at the expectations of the industry and not to dictate to the industry what they should do. Other roadmaps are developed with the purpose of saying this is where an entity wishes to go. The roadmap provides companies with insights on how to adopt drilling systems automation and particularly where to place their technologies. Essentially, it's an education tool to share knowledge more broadly across our industry and enable people to come and play, people or companies from inside the industry or from outside the industry. So what's the range of content and what are some of the deliverables? You said it was to where to place their technology, but what's some of the content and deliverables from the roadmap? So the roadmap is a huge volume, actually. It's available online. It's a specific website, www.dsaroadmap.org. And there anybody can download it currently. It's got 14 sections and is 325 pages in length. And each section is downloadable as its own PDF file. So the 14 sections range from an overview through a discussion about the process we adopted, the vision and needs for drilling systems automation, a current future state description, the future state with the time we develop the roadmap and as it currently stands is looking at 2025. And then the challenges that we address, so systems architecture, communications, sensors instrumentation and measurement, drilling machines and equipment, control systems, modeling and simulations, human systems integration, standards and certification, and very much a placeholder in contingency management. And the final section is summary observations. If somebody wanted to go and take the fast read, go to the final section, summary observations. And what were the deliverables? So, yeah, we actually created some good output. In the systems architecture, we proposed a hierarchy of reference architecture through pattern architecture and solutions architecture. And this is a methodology that comes from DODF, Department of Defense Architectural Framework. And what it gives us is a means to have a commonality of effective adoption at the higher level, but allowing industry to develop their own solutions at the more detailed level. And recently, we've seen a significant positive response to this and an uptake of this idea. Then there's levels of automation taxonomy. And this takes the work from Sheridan from back in 78 with the 10 levels of automation. And it actually mapped it out over four cognitive functions. We took a methodology that was already developed since Sheridan's first work and was most recently developed by the single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research Project. And they're looking at a pilot and air traffic control. So it's a little bit like our situation with a driller or directional driller in remote operations. And we talked to the leader of that implementation, and he gave us approval to use it. So what we've offered the industry is a level of automation taxonomy, which gives a matrix of levels of automation across the four cognitive functions of acquire, analyze, decide and select, action, and then implementation of action. And again, this is something that is now being adopted and frequently referenced in SPE papers. We also put out a decision and control framework, which we took from ISA 95, which originally was the Purdue model. And in it, we put examples of how our industry acts at certain levels from level zero, which is the actual physical process all the way up to the enterprise. And it's a very useful tool for discussing how communications are flowing, how data is flowing, how control information is flowing up and down the hierarchy. And then the other one that a group worked on really well was sensor attributes. And it was very important that they actually defined the attributes that we will need in our sensors and the quality we'll need in order to be effective in automation. Anticipated milestones were mapped into it in some of the sections, but not continuously. So people can find where the challenge teams thought the dates would be for certain developments in the transition. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you about the milestones. So it sounds very comprehensive. Shopping online can now generate donations for SPE. Here's how you can help. On your first visit to smile.amazon.com, you will be prompted to select a charitable organization to receive donations. After selecting SPE, every eligible purchase you make on Amazon Smile will result in a donation to SPE. It's really that simple and there's no additional charge to you. So start shopping today. From all of us at SPE, thank you for your support. Can you tell us about any companies that have implemented the strategies or developed products based on this roadmap? So I would say that the evidence of use is largely, well largely, mostly anecdotal. So I know some interesting things. A large national oil company apparently instructed all their drilling department to read the roadmap, which I thought was very interesting. I know of a major oil company that did not have an automation strategy in drilling. They reviewed the roadmap and said, we are adopting this roadmap as the foundation of our own drilling automation strategy. And now what I see regularly is publications, technical papers in SPE, articles in magazines, which refer to the roadmap, certain particular sections as their source documentation. So it's the basis of their strategies or the way that they're going to develop drilling automation in the future. So talking about drilling automation, systems automation, who generally are some of early adopters in system automation in the industry that you're aware of? Well, I think it's interesting without naming companies particular names. What I believe we're seeing is a significant drive forward in the U.S., particularly on land, and then in the North Sea. And in the U.S., originally a couple of oil companies led the charge. And then it's recently deferred to the drilling contractors and service companies. And they are now leading the charge. And what we're seeing is evidence that drilling contractors are using their development of automation as a differentiator of their offerings. And in the North Sea, it was a bit of a different way forward, where a major operator is pushing applications quite significantly. And then the supply industry responded. And a lot of what I see happening there is a collaborative approach between this major operator and some of the other operators following suit and the suppliers. What's interesting now is remote operations. Remote operations, you know, with the pandemic and also the oil price collapse, you start to see a desire to reduce headcount to save some money. And remote operations, particularly directional drilling, require on automation to do that. So we're seeing a big uptake of that. So you have digitization with a remote operation with the automated system on the well side. Right. I can imagine that it's a hot topic right now, like you said, with everything going on with the pandemic. What are some of the challenges of implementing the roadmap? What are companies seeing as a hurdle? So as I said earlier, we developed the roadmap as an expectation of how the industry would evolve. So it was not a roadmap detailing how to achieve a particular goal as a business entity. We did put the deliverables in there. And what we now see is that companies are adopting these deliverables that we did. So as I mentioned, the low at the decision and control framework, and even now the systems architecture. So things that we developed within it are being adopted. So the roadmap, I think you mentioned this before, looks to a 2025 vision. Are we as an industry ahead of that curve and anticipated adoption timeline? Or are we catching up? Where does the industry stand on that right now? So the original vision we pursued was developed by 120 participants. It's an SPE workshop in 2012. This vision seemed on occasions to be beyond reach. And then news of progress by some companies corroborated it. So in my mind, it's actually been a roller coaster ride since 2012, looking at are we going to get there or are we not? So if I read you the opening part of this vision, it stated, in 2025, well plans are uploaded into an interoperable drilling system that automatically delivers a quality well bore into the best geological location, installs the casing and zonal isolation according to plan, and updates remote operators and experts in real time to changes in the situation. So what are we seeing now? We're seeing digitized drilling programs. They're becoming available and these digitized drilling programs can then connect to the automated systems, which is uploading the drilling program. Driller Stan, casing running and other activities are being automated and are becoming more common in the more advanced areas. And then directional drilling is probably the leader service in the remote operations and others which will soon follow. So as weird as it sometimes seemed, I think recent evidence points to realization of this vision. And also during this year with the pandemic and the oil price collapse, it appears as a significant change of rate of uptake, faster uptake of digitization and automation. So what do you see as the next phase or what will be the next phase of the development? So as I just mentioned, this rapid uptake that's happening with automation and digitization at the moment. In fact, recently we've redefined this and the next stage of the roadmap will be drilling systems augmentation, augmentation encapsulating both digitalization and automation. So we see this rapid uptake happening now and a major service company was reporting that the 30% increase in remote drilling operations in Q1 2020 and stating that 60% of their drilling operations are being run remotely. This is significant. So we looked and we discussed and said, you know, we need to consider doing an update. The Sandia National Labs process recommends an update every two to five years, depending again on the rate of adoption. And if you consider we released the phase one report to the funders, the JIP funders in April 2017, the phase two publicly released report was June 2019. We're now looking and saying we ought to do an update in 2021 that focuses on a new vision for 2030. To accomplish this in a time of human shortage, we are making some plans for a role at Colorado School of Mines to take the lead from mid 2021. Of course, this is going to cost money. So we're actually budgeting $195,000 for this role and for other needed support for this person to implement it. The challenge we're going to have is to be able to raise the funds, particularly in this current environment. We're also planning to add sections and these are specifically related to digitalization of drilling. So it's an expansion from pure automation to augmentation, digitalization and automation. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SPE programs and activities.

So you mentioned several times about the uptake for automations and remote operations during this time. What do you kind of see as companies, what are their challenges as they not rush to do this, but maybe speed up their endeavors to accomplish remote operations and drilling automation? So the common statement when we get into discussions and debates on this is that the rate of adoption is not hindered by technology. It's more driven by the business models and politics in the drilling business. And I think as you can see from recent publications, a lot of people are beginning to put out there that the business model needs to change in order those that are developing these new automated systems can earn early rewards, rather than just the differentiation as a competitive advantage. And then there are significant challenges when high cost assets ought to be replaced. That's happened all the time in our industry. So if you have a new design drilling rig, how can it replace an old one, which is not going to be obsolete as a financial asset? Unfortunately, the last wave of rig construction adopted advanced control systems with variable frequency drive motors. And this is technically a good application for automated systems over the top. The issue then becomes who's software and who's software, how safe and reliable is it? How does it connect to the various proprietary systems? And this challenge falls under what we've defined as interoperability, which again is both a contractual and a technical issue. There is an initiative underway to develop some standards to help advance interoperability across the various companies and systems in the drilling operation. But what's rather interesting and coming to light now is that business pressures seem to have caused individual organizations to bridge this gap more rapidly themselves. So there is more being accomplished in interoperability than is visible publicly. Again, sensors, sensor capabilities to support the automated processes. There are some initiatives underway for the drilling rig sensors to generate an API recommended practice and for sensor stewardship guidelines. And the intent here is that these sensors then can be maintained and checked that they meet their capabilities. Then the focus is going to be moving towards sensors with higher capabilities, so higher quality that's always on data streams that's applicable for automation. There's some discussion about these and some people working on it, but we still need a big transition forwards in some of the more common methods that date back to the, should we say, the mid 1990s. So this is a huge industry initiative. How do you go about getting buy-in from different companies to the roadmap? How do you promote it? How do you talk to other companies about it? So it's available publicly online at, as I said, www.dsaroadmap.org. We've held workshops so we can have interactive processes. We follow up where we can, but at the moment it's more that the product is available for people to actively take themselves. I think the big issue is to do the update next year and to make sure that we have that available for the industry. Right, yep, it's an important time to do the update, like you said. So I recently talked to Fred Florence about drill robotics competition. How do you think that competition could benefit the move towards further automation in the industry? So that's the competition using college students to develop a drill base. So first of all, drill robotics is a fantastic competition and a great accomplishment. And I think Fred needs to be credited with the passion that he has driven it with to get it to where it is. And then Sashi Tyler, who is now taking over that lead role from Fred. So what does it do? I think firstly, attract students from outside petroleum engineering. The successful teams have figured out that they can't do it with just petroleum engineers or drilling engineers. They need engineers from other disciplines, control engineers, mechatronics engineers. They also need to understand project management. And we really need different expertise coming into our industry. Drilling engineers are not going to be able to do this. So that means that we need to attract these other other expertises such as mechatronics. The other thing it's doing is creating an opportunity for algorithm development that can be added to the available portfolio of systems. Students have been quite inventive from what we've seen. The winning students do present a paper of the SBEIDC drilling conference in March and describe their accomplishment. And the papers they have presented have been very high quality, very well presented and demonstrated they've accomplished a lot. It's interesting to see that they've developed control algorithms that successfully overcome the surprises that Fred casts into their unknown simulated formation test blocks. So I think there's the opportunity to bring in disciplines from outside petroleum engineering and drilling and also to have students make some breakthroughs in algorithm development with fresh minds. Yeah, that's the piece of it, getting fresh minds and new perspectives on it that could help move the drilling automation industry forward.

"SPE Live Podcast: Technical Director Series ‚Äì Data Science in Production and Operations ‚Äì Opportunities, Gaps, and Future Outlook","Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live artificial intelligence systems and drilling. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on February 21st 2024 and now your moderator Deep Joshi. Welcome to this SPE live on artificial intelligence systems and drilling. My name is Deep Joshi. I'm a data scientist at quantum capital group. I'll be your moderator today. Today's SPE live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest, Radhika Mihai. Radhika Mihai is a senior researcher in energy modeling and automation group at Norse Norwegian Research Center where she leads the drilling automation and autonomy in the center for research-based innovation digitals. Radhika has a PhD in algorithmic graph theory from the University of Bergen and has been living with, has been working with drilling automation for the last 14 years including being involved in the demonstration of autonomous drilling at a full-scale offshore type rig in 2021. She holds a part-time position as associate professor at the informatics department University of Bergen, Norway. In addition, Radhika is currently leading the activities under the verification and validation sub committee of the SPE drilling system automation technical section. Radhika, welcome to this SPE live. Good morning, Deep. Good morning and good afternoon to the ones following us. Thank you for the introduction. Thanks, Radhika. Before we get into the overall topic, let's start by laying some groundwork. What is AI? Yes, isn't that the question which is currently asked everywhere? And there are, of course, many definitions of what AI is, some of this changing throughout the years. But I would like to rephrase and refer to instead of AI in general, AI techniques, because I'm using several other people, of course, are using AI techniques as a tool to reach a higher level of automation, all the way to autonomy in some cases. So if I go back to AI techniques, I just would like to mention that these techniques include a large range of algorithmic techniques from rule based to causal models, machine reasoning, machine teaching, and all the way to machine learning techniques. Just to mention a few of those. My goal is not to try to define AI, but as I mentioned, I would like to refer to the AI techniques as a tool. And there are many examples of how these are used as tools in existing automation systems. And in some cases, all the way to autonomy, as I mentioned, for instance, active decision making to optimize process with respect to a given goal. And when assessing which AI techniques to use, I would like to mention some of the factors which are important to take into account. So for instance, how much data is needed for a method to work? How much if the method if an AI method is has some specific features, it has some specific assumptions, it can react, for instance, to abrupt changes in environment. Can such an AI method handle a context which is not fixed, which is the case of drilling where we are dealing with different companies, different sensors? Is it possible? Is it the AI technique considered capable of handling time and space, the data? Can such a technique be offering continuous real-time functioning without interruptions and so on? The list is much longer than this. Thanks for the answer, Radekha. Following up with that, you mentioned using AI techniques in drilling. So based on the dependence of drilling on multiple providers, can these be used efficiently in drilling? This is a good question. So as I mentioned, there are many techniques which have been implemented in several applications connected to drilling. And there is a variety of examples in application from automated searching and retrieval of information, to finding patterns in data streams, and all the way to active decision making in an attempt to reach high level of automation. So given the fact that drilling is fragmented, and we are usually dealing with several of these automated functionalities being able to work together and have different levels of automation, it brings us also up to the question, what is a high level of automation? What qualifies as an autonomous system? And many aspects that play into the picture when assessing automation level and autonomy. So I could mention some of you. So one is actually the case that the fact that drilling involves multiple actors, and each are delivering its own data or its own functionality and how to make this work together seamlessly, and how to exchange information and collaborate together in a safe way. Some others refer to the complexity of the problem, environmental complexity, for instance, dependence on input from human operator is an AI system capable of taking a decision without input from a human operator. Can that system learn from experience or display into account when assessing what level of automation the different functionalities have? And this brings another level of complexity when having all this working together in an overall system. It's not my, if I may just one second, so it's not my intent to detail now the differences between automated and autonomy, but I would like to encourage those interested to attend the SP drilling conference where there will be a presentation on a proposal from a group under the DSAAT, where trying to proposing a taxonomy for autonomy levels for drilling systems, which includes aspects such as complexity, uncertainty, sparse data, human interaction, some of the things that I have mentioned. That makes sense. You mentioned different AI systems are drilling, in your opinion, there's some of the requirements that are important in implementing or using AI systems. There are, of course, many requirements and characteristics that can be mentioned here. But if I have to mention a first one, I would, I would say safety. And here is what I mean is both internal safety and external safety. And I will try to detail what I mean by this to this perspective. So if we consider an AI system taking active decisions in order to implement those decisions, the system needs to steer the equipment, the machinery on the rig. So this means that it should not exceed machine limits, it should avoid collision and so on. So it needs to take into account the limitation given by the equipment on the rig. And since the AI system together with the equipment form in a way an overall system, which steers the drilling process, then we can refer to this as internal safety issues, safety characteristics. At the same time, we have the external perspective, because an action which is taken during drilling operation by an AI system, it will influence the drilling process and in particular the downhole conditions, for instance. So an AI, any AI system used in the drilling context in for active decision making should account for process limitations, for instance, not exceed pressure limits, not exceed the pack of limits, this to ensure a safe operational use. And this is what I refer to as safe safety externally. But then the drilling is a critical process. And of course, safety is the first requirement. But I would like to also mention that safety goes hand in hand with trustworthiness of this technology. So then is the question what does this mean? What it means to trust in an AI system? And here, sorry, and then here then again are many views of this, I would like to mention something. So for me, trust in the AI system means that to trust the system, the system will make the correct decisions under the correct assumptions. It means that the system understands what happened when it failed. It means that the predictions are in line with the expectations. It means that it has a thorough knowledge of the limitations. And actually, this is very important one, because knowing that the AI systems perform optimally on a specific set of data or a situation is actually very useful. And it's not something that we hear a lot about. It's mostly on the research side. Another aspect is situational awareness, the depth of understanding that a system has the current condition of the drilling process. And the higher the level of automation, the higher the need for contextual information, which brings it back brings us back to the topic of safety. And here, I just, of course, since drilling is a critical environment, there is a very important question to ask. So what happens when suddenly an AI system that is taking active decisions and steers the drilling process isn't available? And then there is a need to revert to manual mode. How to convey all that contextual information, which was in the AI system, back to allow for a good transition to the manual control. So I would say that management is transition from automatic autonomous mode to manual mode is a very important requirement. That makes a lot of sense. What are some of the specific challenges before applying AI techniques in drilling? Yeah, so of course, each domain has its own challenges, and they're usually given by the complexity of the problem, by the environment, by the issues such as observability, uncertainty, which they're all present in the drilling problem. So on top of that, as you mentioned earlier, we have we are dealing with multiple providers, we are dealing with proprietary systems, black box behavior, rigid versus adaptive behavior. Sometimes we don't have information on the training data from the different functionalities, from the AI systems, online training capabilities. And here by online, I don't mean on the cloud, but I mean on the fly throughout the process and information on specific assumptions. So I would also like to point something else and going back to this multiple providers view is that drilling, as I mentioned, being a complex environment, and evolves all these providers, service companies, recontracts, and so on. So the information which is gathered around is fragmented. So that's, I would say, one of the major challenges is to be able to have a continuous and smooth data information flow across the different parts. So here I'm not only saying data, but it's also the information from the different automated functionalities which are in the picture, because it's not only raw data, which is of relevance. So if a system is integrated under one entity or one provider, then of course, one could assume complete knowledge of the different parts. But if we are looking at a distributed version of the problem and we have several of these AI systems or automated functionalities around, and they want to collaborate, all these functionalities consider to be delivered from multiple sources, multiple providers, then we are dealing with a fragmented environment. So the question is how to ensure coexisting and collaboration without explicit integration under one entity. And this is very important because it also goes back to what I said about contextual information that we need to provide in case of a transition to manual mode, but it's also because the system needs to be able to deal in general, inform about possible failures, inaccuracies, errors, both to the external human operator and also to be able to ensure itself that based on this knowledge, it's possible to steer reliably the drilling process. Thanks, Erika. Before we move on to our next question, I just want to encourage the audience to feel free to ask questions in the comments and throughout the event and not wait till the end so that we can incorporate those in the conversation. You mentioned in the intro, I mentioned that you were working with the Verification and Validation Subcommittee in the SP Drilling System Automation Technical Section or DSATS. What does your work focus on and what is the committee focus on right now? Yes, so this connects a bit to the previous part that I mentioned about being a fragmented environment when it comes to the knowledge. So I just want to go a bit more into detail. So we are faced now with many of these automated functionalities that are available from the different providers involved in the drilling operation. So, but at the same time, we still see that there is a challenge when we try to enable these automated agents to work consistently to gather the drilling site. This in the case when we don't have explicit prior integration under one entity. So the Verification and Validation Subcommittee at DSATS is currently working on mapping these challenges that the industry is facing in the current state. And I would also like to use the opportunity because I'm pretty sure among our viewers there are many which have a lot of knowledge on these challenges on the current state. I'd like to use the opportunity to invite those of you interested to join us and share with us. So to going forward on the information on the subcommittee work, as I would like to say that the subcommittee is first trying to map existing definitions because this is the first point that we have to have a common definition of verification and validation among us. And this is similar to the discussion that we had before on what qualifies as an autonomous system. So as long as we are not having the same definition, it's difficult to proceed. So this is one of the first words that we have been focused on. Now, next we are mapping the challenges as I mentioned. But we are also looking into possible solutions that can cope with this dynamic structure that we mentioned, that we are facing in drilling. And to repeat what I mean by this dynamic structure, I mean a system of systems where you have different level of automations. They are trying to work together. So basically we are referring to a multi-agent type of system. And in this distributed systems, the agents might become unavailable, might be replaced and so on. So any verification or validation needs to cope with this dynamic structure and the complexity it gives to the process of verification and validation. So our aim is to share the work with the community through publications and different events. And of course, it's an open invitation for those who want to join the subcommittee. So far, the group is focusing on the verification or validation of the interplay of these agents. So not on the verification or validation of the automated functionalities themselves, but on the high level of the system. But on how they can work together and how do they collaborate in a good way, in a consistent way and in a safe way. So the work in the group involves different backgrounds. It's a multidisciplinary team. So we are welcoming backgrounds from computer science, from operations, from drilling, and it's a place for you as well if you want to join us. And either share from the challenges that you are facing or if you're aware of solutions, which has worked very good. Or if you want to contribute to a possible solution on the way towards online verification or validation. And by online here, I mean on the fly because we need a verification or validation which can cope with changes. And it can be a continuous process throughout the operation. Thanks, Erika. Just to follow up on it, if someone from the audience wanted to join the subcommittee, how can they do that? Yes, thank you. So it's possible to either send me an email if you want, or we also have a website under the results and it's possible to join the website and also mention that you want to join. We are running regular meetings on Teams because we are in the group. We are people from different countries, different times zones. So we try to make sure that this fits. It's a good time for everyone. So just get in touch and we will find out. Thanks for that information. Going back to AI and drilling, are there any limitations to the applications of AI and drilling? Of course, as in any field, I would say that there can be limitations. And going back to the assessment that I mentioned in the beginning, when one assesses... So first, we don't start with a technique and say, I want to use this technique and try to fit that technique to my problem. But we consider a problem first and then find a technique which can work to solve the problem that I have. And then for the assessment, you can find a technique which is handling in the best way the problem that we are dealing with. As part of this assessment, one can figure out which limitation each of these techniques has. Thanks, Radhika, for the answer. Back to you, Deep. Thanks, Radhika. Going to another question from the audience. What is the best way to address the challenge to education? Big workforce on... Okay, I can continue maybe a bit more on this. So if we go back to the fragmented part that I mentioned before, because of the multiple providers, for instance, if data and communication is not available, then this is a major limitation. But I see Deep now is back. Please, Deep. Thanks, Radhika. Can you hear me? Yes. Yeah. So another question from the audience. What is the best way to address the challenge to educate big workforce on an auto digitization and automation to get familiar with automated platforms as the outputs of different platforms depend on the inputs that are given by the user? One of the major challenges is to build trust in the technology, as I mentioned before, and that trust is built by knowing about the technology, by seeing how the technology works. So as long as someone sees that you get results is something which eases my work instead of making it more difficult, then also encourage to use it further. And of course, it's a problem when we are dealing with multiple platforms, multiple automated functionalities. And in this fragmented picture that I mentioned before, I only mentioned automated functionalities, but the human input is also one part of the fragmented part because they also influence the processor. It goes back to what I said earlier, that we would like this smooth, smooth collaboration and smooth communication of data and information throughout the distributed system. Does that make sense? Sorry, but thanks a lot for the answer. Ask me another question from the audience. What is the, how well does the, you mentioned different AI systems and their implications on drilling industry. How well does the industry understand what AI really is and what is on its applications? I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? Yeah, so how well does the drilling industry understand what AI really is? And how well does the industry understand what some of its applications are? Yeah, this is a very good question. And of course, it's hard to answer that question as from the point of view, I don't know, industry point of view. But I think one important part is that for all this initiatives, such as the verification and validation one is to disseminate to the industry the work done. And by dissemination, it will start dialogue and discussions. And by this, we will have a bi-directional dialogue. And by this, we will have a bi-directional dialogue. And by this, we will have a bi-directional understanding. And we can help each other to evolve on the understanding. Some might need to go more on the AI, some might need more to go on the operational and so on. So I think collaboration is the key. And to what is the current status that is hard for me to assess. So you mentioned the verification and validation subcommittee. What will the results from the subcommittee be shared with the community and how are they shared? I'm afraid I didn't catch the last part. Could you repeat? So the results from the verification and validation subcommittee shared with the larger drilling and auto-missions subcommittee? Yes. So, yes, so this is our plan. This is what we want to do. We want to disseminate as much as possible. So by sending abstracts and try to publish in the venues for SBE and also Proder. And we also plan to inform and have a newsletter on the website as we evolve and develop more in our work in the subcommittee. So are there any procedures? Take another question from the audience. Are there any specific, any defined procedures for choosing the best AI techniques for different drilling problems? Yes, this is a good question. Thank you for asking. So, yes, as I mentioned before, there are many points that one could use when deciding what technique to use to solve one problem. So for the drilling, it really depends because drilling is a large topic. So it depends what part of drilling what the first part is to assess the complexity of the problem, to see what needs to be solved. What is the goal? And then look into the different methods. And as I mentioned before, look at how a method can cope with the time and sparsity of data. How can cope with learning on the fly? How can you cope with learning from experience? How can that technique can cope with provided continuous functioning and so on? Thanks for your comments, Rourika. So as we close up the SBE live, we'd like to ask you for your final thoughts on AI systems that target high level automation. Thank you, Deep. So I'd like to go back a bit to what I mentioned before with AI systems and their design to ensure safe handover to manual control if needed. So in my opinion, ensuring good management of transition from high level of automation or autonomy to manual control is a very important requirement for an AI system. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank you all who followed us today and for all who asked the questions. And to you, Deep, for leading the discussion and to SBE for inviting me here today. Thank you, Rourika. Thanks to the audience for the questions and your comments. And thank you for joining us today. See you next time."
SPE Live Podcast: Addressing the Energy Challenge With Fiber-Optic Sensing,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the SPE Live Technical Director Series, Completions and Drilling Operations. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on September 16th, 2024. Welcome to this SPE Live Completions and Drilling Operations. My name is Peggy Ryken. I'm the Chapter Manager, Geomechanics at Chevron's Technology Center and the incoming SPE Technical Director Completions. I'll be your moderator today. So the SPE Live will last about 30 minutes and we encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. So it's now my pleasure to introduce our guests. I'll start with Robin McMillan. Robin is a Business Development Manager at IBM. Previous to his position, he was the Chief Sales Officer at DataGumbo, Senior Vice President, Business Development at NOV, President at drillbit company, Reed Hycolog, and Manager of Slumberjays Drilling and Measurements in Canada. Robin has several technical publications, served on program committees of various IADC and SPE conferences, and as both Vice Chair and Membership Chair of the SPE Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section. He's also served the IADC as Vice President Drilling Services, a member of the Executive Committee and the Chair of the Advanced Rig Technology Committee. Robin holds a geology degree from Leeds University in the UK and a further education teaching certificate. So welcome Robin. I would also like to introduce our second speaker, Karen Olson. Karen Olson is a consulting engineer specializing in sealed wellbore pressure monitoring in unconventionals and deepwater Gulf of Mexico completion designs. Karen has been a completion reservoir engineer for over 40 years, starting her career as a frac engineer for the Western Company of North America. She's also worked at Holdage Associates, Mobile and BP, working deepwater gum, onshore unconventionals and conventionals, and the North Sea. Karen holds a bachelor's in petroleum engineering from LSU and a master's in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M. She has been honored as a distinguished alumni graduate in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M and currently serves as a Texas A&M Petroleum Engineering Department Industry Advisory Board member. She's an SPE Board of Directors and is the SPE Completions Technical Director. So Robin and Karen, welcome to this SPE Live. So I am very excited to be talking to you today, and I'm sure the audience is eager to hear your thoughts. So let's start with your thoughts on where the industry is heading. So Robin, what are some of the current highlights or priorities in drilling that you would like to share with the audience? Thanks Peggy. Good morning and good morning Karen. Well, you won't be surprised to hear that probably the drilling priorities are drill further, drill faster and drill safer, and do all that with a lower carbon footprint. And we do have the technologies, you know, lots of technologies now, which are helping us do all those things. Now, sometimes the challenge is the adoption of new technologies, you know, once they've been introduced to the market. But we do certainly have the wherewithal. I can go through some of those if you'd like. Yeah, do share a little bit of those. I think that'd be good. OK. You think probably the first back in the day, you know, we used to do on a rig, we'd do a drill off test, which would be you'd set certain parameters. You know, you might set a fixed RPM and try a different weight on bit, et cetera, and the other way around at a constant flow rate. Now we have the ability and program to do that on a on a continual basis. So what that does, it gives you that it'll give you a rate of penetration for each of those combinations of parameters. And therefore you can pick the best. And I say now we have programs that we already use in the market that will do that. In fact, we do that several times a minute in some cases. And so drilling efficiency from that point of view is better than it was. And also we have the ability now to to scan offset data far better than we used to. And we also have predictive analytics now. And I think, you know, so if you're trying to, for example, avoid down hold dysfunction, if you think of something drastic like stuck pipe, you know, a subject matter expert looking at the data leading up to an event like that would say, you know, if I'd really been paying attention to the data, I'd really been paying attention for the last six hours and staring all these data streams and gauges. I could have seen that coming. I could have predicted that because we don't have time to stay out the gauges for five or six hours, but we do have the ability now to train an algorithm to do that. So you would you feed the data to the algorithm and say, right, next time you see this trail of data, you know, this is this is telling us something drastic is about to happen. And so to raise the flag and it gives you the opportunity to mitigate those sort of issues before they become an issue. And that's also helped by some of the transmission right now. That's a lot better than it was. You know, we have we had wide pipe actually for for over 20 years. And they certainly getting more traction in the market and there are more and more companies trying it. And that gives us 50,000 bits per second as opposed to a handful of bits per second. So now we have a lot more data from down whole some of it along the data string. Sorry, along the drill string. So you can actually you get a picture of what's happening both within the pipe and inside the. So, yes, so, yes, I'm really exciting combinations, I think, between drilling and some and some AI machine learning and our ability to, you know, gather and coalesce a whole bunch of data in a short period of time to make it easy to digest. Thank you for sharing that, Robin. So, Karen, same question for you from a from a completions perspective. What are some of the current highlights or priorities? Hey, Peggy, thanks for having me here today, Robin. Good to see you. Yeah, the completion world, you know, at least in the unconventionals seems like efficiency is always our top priority. Efficiency and safety, of course. One of the things that I'm starting to see out in the least in the unconventional world is, you know, signing of racks have been going on for multiple years now, but it was typically just down two wells, fracking two wells at the same time. I'm now starting to see companies fracking multiple wells at the same time to speed up operations even even more, which I think is quite exciting on there that really help with efficiencies. And then, of course, on the just the designs of the completions, the seems like people have sort of honed in on the cluster spacings in the 15 to 25 foot spacing realm. And then it seems like on the limited entry, I think everybody is, at least on the plug and perf, everybody's shooting for around 1500 psi pressure drops. So it's sort of been interesting to see how wide a completion design, varied completion designs and how it's sort of honed in to a sort of almost a common design across the unconventional realm. And talking, this is interesting, I think, because talking to we've just launched a offshore completions technical section. And one of the reasons we've done that is because a lot of the a lot of the guys and gals that I've talked to in the in the offshore world, they're still working in their own little bubble by company. And there's not a lot of collaboration. And they sort of look over the fence and see what's happened in the unconventional world with so much collaboration that's gone on. And they're like, we need to get to that as well. We need to get to the point where we can develop these offshore completions and optimize them quicker. Just like the unconventional world has done. And a lot of that has been because there's been so much collaboration through SBE, through all the workshops that we have and conferences and papers being written. And so I'm excited about our new offshore completions technical section. Kartik Mahadev is the chair for that section. And they should be starting up, I think, this fall with some meetings on there. Yeah, so that's sort of it on the technology side. You know, to get us there. I think the big thing, too, that's going on is real time. We're doing real time, real time, you know, which we've always brought in data real time for the most part. But now we're doing real time diagnostics. And we got people that can interpret and call jobs now. It's almost full circle to what we used to do in the convention world that we'd call jobs real time. And I think we're getting back to that in the unconventional world with real time data, real time fracture diagnostics, real time fiber, sealed well bore. All of that can come back to your screen. And also there's even software that's been developed that shows you or gives suggestions to the well site supervisor as to what he should do or she should do. Increase your rate, maybe by three barrels a minute, and the pressure will change by a few hundred psi. And then you'll get this much incremental net present value. So it's exciting right now. So some exciting sharing both from a drilling and a completions perspective, I think some commonalities actually that you heard, efficiencies, the ability to ingest and analyze and analyze data. So some exciting technologies. Thank you for sharing that. So both of you have had a long track record of service in SPE and have had lots of involvements over the years and participated in many events. So, Karen, maybe you can share what are your favorite SPE events that you typically attend and why? Yeah, well, you know, I've been been going to SPE events, I guess, since I was a student, which I won't say how long ago that was, but it was a long time ago. And my truly favorite event, of course, is our hydraulic fracturing conference that we hold in the Woodlands every year. I've made everyone I've been on the committee for that conference every year, but one year I rolled off for one year just so I can say I rolled off, but then I'm back on it. And I love it just because of the people that I've met and the people that I've met. I've made everyone I've been on the committee for that conference every year, but one year I rolled off for one year just so I can say I rolled off, but then I'm back on it. And I love it just because of the people that I see every year, you know, you go to these SPE events and it's a great networking events. But it gives me a chance, quite honestly, to see everybody that I call my friend. And then also to hear the latest, I think the best papers are always presented, at least in the hydraulic fracturing world at that conference. And so it helps me keep up with what's the latest, you know, what are people, you know, trying the new things, what's working. Yeah, so that's my number one event. I always go to that one. ERTEC is another favorite. I always try to catch ERTEC just because it gives it a broader perspective. I get to see more around, well, the geology and more reservoir engineering type papers there. And then we have two completion workshops every year, one's near Wellboard that I like to go to. And then there's a far-field one. And those are more, I would say, tight knit. Those are smaller. We usually have maybe 100 people. And you get to talk to and have more time to have discussions one on one with everybody there at those workshops. And then finally, ATCE. I mean, that's our big membership conference that I like to go to. I love going to the awards banquets and seeing who's won the international awards. And then I love to see the international papers that get presented there. And it's just a great time. It's coming up here in a couple of weeks in New Orleans. And luckily, or fingers crossed, we won't have any weather events. But yeah, that's another favorite that I always try to attend on there. So, yeah, thank you for sharing that. Yes. So definitely a lot of the different events that can be of interest for their technical content, for folks with different specialties. So Robin, what is your perspective on some of your favorite events that you typically attend and why? Oh, you're muted, I think, Robin. It's obviously the drilling conference, which I was on the conference committee for many years. And of course, part of the work there is also part of the pleasure is to when you have to assess the abstracts, when you're looking at who's going to present, you realize how much work goes on constantly, how much innovation is going on throughout the industry on a constant basis. So which is always very, very impressive. The other thing, there's something coming up now, which is a forum. And there's a forum series with ESP. And I've been a co-chair on the forum before that. This one's called Accelerating the Adoption of Digital to Transform Drilling and Wells. And so that's a good example. A forum is really, if you think about the sort of events we have, workshops, conferences, a forum is where a group of people get together, usually 50 or 60 people, and basically sit in a room for three or four days and work out, it's all about the future. Where are we going? And so as we both noted in our technology update there, digital transformation is going to be a big part of everything we're doing going forward. And so this is coming up next month, this particular forum. So I'm really looking forward to that because they are really, really valuable and you really feel you're making some progress when you do those. Other conferences, ATC, obviously it's almost like a celebration every year when we go to that. So that's always good. Then there are other conferences, you know, as part of the Advanced Rig Technology Conference with the IDC. So I try to go to that when I can every year. Again, we're talking about drilling technologies and because they're moving on and you find it's a bit like the digital. You find now there's big overlaps with other technologies, robotics for example. Now we talk about removing people from the red zone on a rig and the way to do that is to have robotics doing all the pipe handling, which we now have the ability to do. But it means that now we're overlapping with other technologies such as digital technology and robotic technologies. So you find yourself being sidetracked to technologies which have not necessarily been traditional drilling technologies, but are certainly very interesting. And of course some of these provide you with a steep learning curve, which of course is a big part of the fun. So yeah, conferences are a great day. Obviously we missed them. I think the pandemic showed us how much we missed and when we can't get together. So I think since then we've really made the most of all the conferences that are available. Yeah, thank you for sharing that, Robin. So yeah, I think there's a common theme, right? As a technical director is not surprising. There's a lot for your technical discipline and the ability to network on these different events is something that is a big driver. And yes, ATC being the flagship. And I really liked Robin that our industry is growing and touching more and more different areas. You mentioned robotics that mean that we need to challenge ourselves, grow and stretch. And some of these events are really going to help us doing that. So thank you for sharing that. So just a quick note, if folks in the audience have questions, please put them in the chat and I'll read them out and ask them to Robin and Karen. So as we are talking about SBE and your SBE experiences, I'm sure folks are very interested to hear what helped you in your SBE career. So maybe Karen, you can take that away. What helped you in your career? And maybe you can also elaborate a little bit about how you got to be nominated and selected as a SBE technical director. Thanks, Peggy. Yeah, you know, SBE has been, I would say, just a major part of my career. I would, you know, during my student days, I don't, I would say, you know, I wasn't real active with SBE. I would just attend occasional meetings. It wasn't until I started with mobile and I was working out in a crane, Texas. I don't even know if people know where crane Texas is. Like south of Odessa that I started attending the TransPACUS section. And here I am, I don't know, in my 20s, moved out to West Texas, didn't know anybody. And I started going to the SBE lunches. And now all of a sudden, you know, I start meeting people, start making friends in a town that I didn't know anybody. And I just started building up my network, which I think is so important. And, you know, if you really want to enjoy your job, it's really the people that you work with and that you get to know. And you got to find that niche that you really enjoyed doing. And that's what SBE, you know, when I first started, it allowed me to do. It helped me build that network, make those connections. And then one thing that my advisor at Texas A&M, Dr. John Lee, he used to preach to us that it was our duty to give back. And that we should first off, anytime we, you know, do a project, we should write a paper about it. Even if it's a, you know, even the project fails, we need to write about the failures and the successes. Most of us don't write papers about the failures. But that's one thing that we need to do. So then I started, you know, writing papers and publishing papers, presenting. So then it gives you, it gives you good presentation. And then you can do a lot of work with that. And then, you know, I started to write a lot of papers about it. And then I started to write a lot of papers about it. And then I started to write a lot of papers about it. And then I started to write a book about doing composition. familiarity execution. And I like to introduce copyright karate. I've done this book, I've written it, I need it for a few months, then II find my way up. sections and then I started getting involved with workshops, forums, being on the committees, being active, being co-chair, you know, just raising my hand. And now all of a sudden it helps you develop your leadership skills. You know, how do you, especially when it's all volunteers, how do you get volunteers engaged and that they want to help and do things and how do you give them that vision that we want to accomplish something and make it exciting so people want to get involved in it versus just, you know, dictating, hey, we got to do this, this and this. It's just my husband that gets the dictating role of me. But yeah, so it does give me good leadership skills and being on the board, I guess I was just blessed that, you know, I have friends that nominated me and it's been an exciting time. I would highly recommend it. You know, if you've been active in SPE and Peggy's going to be taking over and I look so forward to see what she's going to be doing the next three years. But yeah, so being on the board of directors, I would say there's two sides of it. There's one where you're looking at the global operations of SPE and as I told Peggy, you just go in and think, okay, what seems to be working? And when you see something, a lot of times I call them ah-has and I go, oh, aha, why aren't we doing this? For example, when I first started as a technical director, I went to the president's luncheon at ATCE and I noticed all the regional sections were getting these president's awards, technical excellence awards, and I'm sitting there just thinking, well, why don't we give awards to the technical sections? They're doing great things. We don't award them. And so I mentioned it to the SPE president, Kamel Benakar at the time, and he goes, that's a great idea, Karen, let's do it. So now we do it. So now the technical section's good awards. So a lot of times it's just, you know, having a fresh set of eyes, as everybody's well aware, you get that fresh set of eyes come in and you see things that people have just sort of overlooked. And then it's also the technical discipline side of it. You know, what can we do, you know, to make our discipline better? And in this case, we've added a new technical sections, the offshore technical section, which I've done forums. Yeah. So I don't want to keep on because I want to give Robin a chance to talk, but yeah. Thank you for sharing that perspective, Karen. Yes. So Robin, what can you, so how has SPE helped your career and what is your perspective there? Well, I always feel that it's sort of, it's like the default really, that when you start in the world, in my case, in the world of drilling, then you become, you join the SPE. And really, I would always encourage people to join their local chapter. My route really has been more through the technical section, through drilling, particularly looking at things like drilling automation. But what I found is that people, they want people to jump in. So in those sort of, quite often the philosophy is you put your hand up and say, I've got a brilliant idea. Why don't we do this? And they say, that is such a good idea, Robin. Yeah. Off you go. You do it. And so you find yourself volunteering for all sorts of things, which is a good thing. It also means that you have to become, particularly when you start presenting, you do papers, as Karen was talking about, when you start presenting. As people, anybody in the teaching profession will know, or even in lectures at college, you better really know your subject before you stand up in front of a crowd. And so if you, for example, you co-authored a paper, I remember doing a, this was, it was a drink conference in San Diego. And I was co-author on a managed pressure drilling, but I wasn't the technical expert for all of managed pressure drilling. But I had to become so because I was going to stand up in front of 500 people. And so it really does mean that you better learn your subject. But I always think that people, it would be good to encourage people to get involved with SPE as early as possible, which means as Karen did, join as a student. And within drilling, we have a mechanism for doing that. And it's a student competition called Drobotics. And this has been really successful since about 2015, when Fred Florence, who's basically been driving it for the last few years, really, from the very beginning, he would build basically a geological column in a wooden box. And he'd throw in a mix of things to make this rock interesting, even put a slam of rubber in it, but it would be in a box. And then the students had to build a small miniature rig and then drill through this rock. And then once they could drill, then we asked them, can you drill directionally? And then we got to the point for the last few years when we've actually had virtual rigs as well as the miniature mechanical rigs. And I think what's really good about that is that we can now, if we're going to start doing it virtually, we can probably start our student competitions in other disciplines. And there was not just drilling in. You wouldn't want people to have to build a miniature crack pump, for example. So if we do any virtual, then there's probably a lot more scope. So for me, the SP, it's enabled me to be involved, to volunteer, to go to the forums, go to the conferences. Networking, obviously, as Karen said, is a big part of it. And then, of course, you end up in a situation where you've been around the block enough, so somebody decides that maybe you could be on the board. And I was also, as Karen said, lucky enough to be nominated. Being part of the board is actually extremely satisfying because you realise how dedicated, you know, so it's 20 people on the board, and how dedicated they all are to getting this done. And the feel, you know, this thing about giving back, you certainly feel the weight of responsibility, that you're there, you're looking at the strategy for 120,000 members, and you better get it right. You know, this is quite, it feels quite a responsibility. But there's a lot of satisfaction in doing that. And so it is, it's actually a lot of work, but it's also extremely enjoyable and satisfying. So I'm very grateful, actually, to have been nominated to the board. So thank you for sharing that. And yeah, there was a question from LinkedIn that, from John DeWart on the drillbotics. So, Sir Robin, I think you've already addressed that. So, Yeah. Hi, John. Yeah, John, in fact, John, I mentioned co-chair in a forum, John was the co-chair on that forum a few years ago. It's a great, great chair there. Thank you. So basically, yeah, I think some great sharings on some technologies where you see, you know, the industry heading for drilling and completions, and then your journey and your experiences through SBE. So I wanted to close off to, with each of you sort of sharing your thoughts for, you know, folks that are perhaps a little bit more junior in their career. So what are sort of like some exciting opportunities or some thoughts that you would like to share with them? So maybe Robin, you take it away? Yeah. Yeah, sorry. What was the question? So what are some, what from your perspective, some exciting technologies or some exciting thoughts for somebody more junior in their career to consider as they're stepping into, you know, their SBE career? Yeah, I would, well, it's interesting, of course, that I am, I know work for IBM. And so that has been a, certainly a different track for me. I've been in drilling all my working life. And what I find now, I guess I'm a good example of where you can find, you can overlap with new technologies that are, which are, as we talked about before, outside the traditional drilling technologies. And so now what I'm doing is looking at, if you like, data science, skill set, and how do you apply those? And I think there's a lot of satisfaction in us bringing in people from other technologies, other disciplines. And we now have, if you look at some of the our other technical sections, like data science, for example, that covers a lot of the oil field petroleum engineering skills. And so we get overlaps now, we've got a, we've got a management technical section, for example, and you can imagine how broad that is. And then what we find in is that petroleum engineering skills are now being applied as part of the energy evolution. So whether it's CCUS or hydrogen or geothermal, I'm also very grateful that the geothermal technical section reports to drilling, because obviously there's a lot more technologies involved in geothermal, but drilling is a big part of it. So you find now when you become part of SBE, that there are far broader group of technical disciplines that you're able to go and be part of. So, yeah, thank you. Interesting. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that, Robin. So any final thoughts, Karen, that you want to leave folks with? I would, I would just say, you know, volunteer, you know, if you're, if you want to get ahead career wise, volunteer and volunteer for the conferences that you like, that's your favorite. And come to the conferences and let's, and come up and talk to us. You know, don't be afraid to say, oh, they're not going to, they don't have time to talk to us. Yeah, come up and, you know, let's have a conversation. I'd love to meet everybody. I'll be at ATCE next week and I'd love to see everybody there. And yeah, and it's been a great three years as a completions technical director. And it's, as Robin said, you know, working with everybody on the board and everybody in the completions world has been amazing. And, and I look forward to seeing Peggy taking over and all the wonderful things I know she's going to do too. So yeah. Okay, Robin. I was going to say, we'll miss you, Karen. She won't go far. We won't let her go far. So, yeah, I'll still be around. Hopefully. So yes. So Robin, Karen, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts where you see things heading, where the exciting opportunities are and sharing your experiences with SB. Thank you for the, to the audience for, for participating and we'll see you next time. Great. Great. Thank you, Peggy. Yep. Thanks, Robin. Thanks, Peggy. Great seeing everybody. See you in New Orleans. Yep. See you in New Orleans. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast. For more content, visit the SPE Energy Stream, the industry's digital pulse at streaming.spe.org.

SPE Live Podcast: A New Era of Production Optimization,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, the future of well integrity. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on January 17th, 2024. And now your moderator, Pierre-Edouard Vincent. Welcome all to this SPE Live on the future of well integrity. My name is Pierre-Edouard Vincent and I'm CWI manager with Trident in London, where I'm dialing from. I will be your moderator for the session today. This SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. Before starting the conversation with our panelists today, I would like you to invite you to attend the SPE workshop on the future of well integrity from March 5 and 6 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. This workshop will be a high quality event where key themes relevant to well integrity will be discussed. The program will include eight action packed sessions with a number of breakouts where deliverables will be captured for all attendees. Those sessions will include setting the scene for well integrity in the energy transition, leading practices within well integrity, understanding and managing risk, the challenges of regulating well integrity, well integrity for CCS, digital well integrity, measuring what matters, and then finally future proofing well integrity. You can find out a bit more about some of those themes in today's SPE Live events. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guests. There will be three. Michael Edwards is founder and president of a consulting company and serves as senior executive advisor for Partners in Performance with 33 years of experience in the energy sector, focused primarily on upstream technology, service operations, well operations, policy, risk management, marketing, governance, and corporate strategy. She served as a government liaison during the Deepwater Horizon emergency response and as a member of the BP leadership team. She holds a BS in mechanical engineering with a minor in robotics from Texas A&M and postgraduate studies in business with several automation, drilling, and flow assurance patents and publications. She's a board member of WITS and serves as the global liaison leading a community of regional representatives. Kenny McAllister started his career as a research scientist and product development project leader outside of the oil industry. For the last 25 years, he has been dedicated to bringing new technology to the well space, including downhole fiber optics and innovative downhole electronic measurement and zonal control, including full smart wells working for both innovative SMEs and tier one service companies. Kenny has been managing director of SealTight UK, bringing well integrity solutions to Europe, Middle East, and Africa operators for more than a decade. Kenny is also active in I-COTA, DECOM North Sea, and particularly SP Aberdeen, where he has served held several positions, including chair. Kenny currently is the Europe liaison officer for the WITS. Finally, Kareem Shafi is a carbon storage manager at Drax, where he is responsible for screening, selecting, and securing suitable carbon transport and storage capacity for global negative emission BCCS projects. Kareem's experience covers technical, policy, and commercial deployment of CCUS in the UK, Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific. His prior achievements include pioneering best practice guidelines on standard well decommissioning and well decommissioning for future CO2 storage projects and leading industry wide consultations across the UK and EU to ensure policy makers have sound understanding of the technical wells and subsurface challenges associated with CO2 injection. Michael, Kenny, and Kareem, welcome to this SP live, and Michael will start with an introduction about the WITS. Pierre, thank you so much. It's a pleasure and honor to be here with Kenny and Kareem as well. I had a pleasure in working with WITS for the last, I think pretty much my entire career, to some fashion for the last three years. I was asked following my work at BP to join the WITS. I am the global liaison and felt very strongly with our outreach to the regions. And so this year is a bit different. We now have regional leads in all our major regions and we intend to expand that community outreach. So this is a great opportunity for us to share with you, the WITS board. We're expecting a slide up here and I think you are also wanting to put a QR code for people to connect with us. So if you're in a region and you're interested in being involved, please do reach out to us. Let us know what you would like to connect with. And we do want to make sure that we communicate back through our regional leads because we're trying to make sure that we have some organization around what we do and the priorities in the region. Yes. So for those that don't know WITS, WITS is a technical section board that is centered around the well integrity technical section. We are interested in anything having to do with safe management of well integrity across the multiple phases. And as you can imagine, those phases are beyond the ones that we have been traditionally managing in well integrity. And I think today we're going to talk about that a bit as well. So we do want to make sure that people understand that WITS does have a unified purpose around our members and having a robust and healthy discussion around what does well integrity mean throughout the life cycle within your academic world as well. So we want to make sure we have that inclusive environment for those that are working out in their respective organizations to come to WITS and share with us your views, where you see the future. So this is a great conversation to be able to do that. We also want to make sure that we're informing you in your region, those areas in which, for instance, this Well Integrity Europe conference, where we want you to feel welcome to join this community, even if you may not have a well integrity background, but you're interested in well integrity. We also want to share with you some of the latest knowledge and best skills. We do have a Wikipedia. We do a blog on a regular basis. These webinars. And if you do see an area that we're missing, we want to hear from you on areas that we'd like to share with our greater global community. So we also want to recognize that well integrity does stretch across multiple disciplines. We tend to be a glue for many of the discussions, particularly when there is an issue. So we want to make sure that the other disciplines that we're used to working with, data analytics, we're ramping up our involvement with that technical section, as well as CCUS, sustainability, and some other sessions. We're used to working with the reservoir engineers and the completion engineers, but we do want to hear from you on are we seeing some additional ones down the road for well integrity? Well, thank you, Pierre. I think that's all I have on my end. Perfect. Thank you, Michael. So we'll now proceed with questions to our panelists. So the three of you, Michael, Kenny, and Karim. And they will be related to the content of the workshop, as we mentioned. So let's get started with a question from leading practices. Leading versus lagging. What do you see could be factors explaining differences between companies and how they manage well integrity? Well, will I jump in on this one, Pierre? Absolutely. Sure. I think there are three areas of leadership that we want operators to really gauge with. Firstly, the big picture of where we're going with well integrity. So whether we know what we should be measuring, how we should be controlling and regulating the practices in the field, and the big picture kind of stuff. I think also we need to be thinking about how the operator and the regulator work together. So Karim, in your introduction described how Karim was trying to describe to the regulators the kind of things they ought to be focusing on and the kind of things that they ought to be measuring and what the key issues in CCUS are going to be. And I think the third area of leadership is really in the coal face. You know, when we're sitting in front of a well, the actual practice by the first line supervisors and the technicians on the jobs looking after our wells and working on our wells. And there are three kind of separate areas where I think we need that kind of leadership. We see variations between national companies and majors, variations in geography and how these kind of things are doing. But we have seen some great exemplars in all of those areas, I think. You know, if we think about the big picture stuff, we've seen the strong engagement with some real leaders in well integrity like Paul Hoffman and Ian Taylor of Shell, who are really good at that high level, big thinking, you know, 20 years down the line kind of thoughts. And, you know, those of us that work on the service side and send people all over the world have seen, you know, the constant practice we see across different geographies and different cultural barriers. And I think that's that kind of leadership is in a lot of ways the most important part. You know, all right, having great thoughts. But I think, you know, it's delivery that really matters when it comes to well integrity. It's great to see that. I've always worked on the service side, so I can't really comment on that interaction between the regulator and the operator. But that's a really key part of making sure this three cornered hat really protects us. So, yes, I think all those areas are really important. And I think we've seen some of the office of national oil companies and some of the majors really driving leadership in all those areas. Kareem, any comments from your side on guidelines, best practices, jointly prepared? Yeah, I suppose to bridge the gap between lagging practice and leading practice would perhaps, you know, be to continue with the relevant engagements with regulators to attend workshops. But more importantly, to actually take part in relevant technical consultations because guidelines and standards, they're the framework for what good looks like. But as we all know, guidelines and standards, they do get updated. And that's the correct platform for everyone on the call to raise any concerns that they have with lagging practice to push the sector towards what good actually looks like. And I think that's going to be fundamental as we now broaden our remit away from oil and gas to consider new energies such as CCUS, perhaps hydrogen storage and geothermal as well. Excellent. Maybe we move to a second question related to understanding and managing risk just in the interest of time. With an aging portfolio across the world and integrity issues gradually developing, what do you think are some good tools to help operators and regulators understand and manage risk? I mean, without giving names, but things you think are going to help us manage that in the future? Any of you? I think we all want to talk about AI, don't we? I think if we look at other integrity issues, you know, a few years back, maybe about a decade ago now, there's some excellent work done on pipeline predictions of failure by Leanne Smith and other leaders in that kind of integrity work. And I've recently been looking to see if there's similar things happening in the wells environment. And we are really at the early stages. You know, data gathering is becoming much more automated than it's been in the past, much more regular than it's been in the past. New wells being drilled have got much more guidance from the regulator and from international guidelines to see what kind of monitoring we ought to be doing. It's a case of looking at that. We've all seen some seminal papers on safety valve failures and that sort of stuff in the old SYNTEF database in Norway, where they've taken data from lots and lots of different operators and service companies, put it in there and analyzed it. Now, what we'd really like to see is more of that work being done, more of that data being mined in order to do more predictive work. I think I'm certainly excited by that and the work that I've been doing the last six months or so talking to suppliers about predictability of failure is really at the early stages in the AI environment. You know, it's much more focused on digital twinning of topside assets and production systems rather than the wells environment. But it definitely will come and it's on a lot of people's radar. So I'm really excited about that. Trying to combine higher levels of monitoring with real solid work on predictability of failure. I call it data analytics. Any comments? Right. Yeah, I do. You can actually see why Kenny joining, which has been a really good benefit for us. I have spent half my career in the service sector, half in an operator. So I often think about the new technology and innovation. It's one of the reasons why the data analytics group asked me to be on their group. One of the trends that we're seeing in the data analytics, data science realm is a need to share data to a much greater perspective. We've known this for a while, but one of the trends we're seeing is that we're able to convince whether it's operator service companies to to donate their data for what I call purpose. Anonymizing the data is fairly easy. We're, you know, signed an NDA with a major operator for our machine learning challenge that's coming up here in spring all around ESP predictive analytics on failure rates. So that's just one of many examples that we do need a, you know, a lot better understanding that data is not necessarily a competitive advantage, especially if you're not able to use it and you're not able to use it to the AI level. Most of our big barriers is that we don't have enough data present to turn around some of these predictive analytic models. I do like to also say that every well is different. So the breadth of of intelligence behind the data is quite quite revealing. And the more we share, we're going to be able to to unlock some of these innovative ways of of eliminating these failures and keeping our wells safe and with high integrity. So, So we will have, of course, during the workshop some fairly extensive coverage of quantitative risk analysis for decision making. So there'll be good discussions on that. And of course, there'll be a session on measuring what matters, which is specifically designed to feed the models to help making good decisions. If we move to well integrity for CCS, maybe take the first question there. CCS is relatively new and the few projects which have been delivered have shown there are still lessons to be learned. In your view, where can we expect potential, you know, technical pinch points with a focus on well integrity? So maybe I can kick kick off with that one. Maybe on the lessons learned, what I would say is it's more of an evolution because we do have good industry practices within our existing sector. We've had decades of expertise when it comes to injecting CO2 for your wire. We've also had a few pilot projects as well that have been successful. But what is actually going to change within this decade is we're moving from a low scale injection to mass scale injection around 10 million tons per annum. And therefore, best practices will have to evolve as well. But in terms of the technical pinch points, that perhaps depends on where we are within the carbon storage lifecycle, such as if we're characterizing a storage site. Are we looking at the design of the well? We're looking at the operations. If it's the first stage site characterization, then the pinch point has to be the legacy well screening because it's the first task that an operator would have to endure to demonstrate to the regulator that the legacy barrier has the integrity to retain CO2, to gain the permission to begin injecting CO2. And that is something that we are going to focus on within the workshop in March as well. And we'll have a session on that. If we're looking at the design aspect, then the technical pinch point here is that we're dealing with a different fluid. So we have to understand that CO2, I mean, CO2 is the primary property that we are dealing with. But when we capture CO2 from emitters, we will have impurities within that CO2 stream. So we have to ensure that the wells are designed with a way of interacting with impurities as well as CO2. We have to understand the technical requirements for the project because if we're transporting CO2 in a dense liquid state and injecting it into a depleted gas field, which has low pressure, then we'll have additional challenges to consider, such as the expansion of that dense phase CO2 into a gas and the associated drop in temperature as a result of that dual Thompson cooling effect. And so we need to make sure that the wells are designed to be able to consider that environment, the materials are adequate, but also that we've qualified components of our well and the valves to be able to tolerate such extreme pressures and temperatures. Does someone want to add something to around CCS? If not, then we'll move on to the next. Here's a question. We'll take one from the measuring, on the measuring what matters theme. What do we see as some of the challenges associated with measuring well integrity inside of wells? Do we see new promising new technology helping us understand better integrity conditions inside the wells so we can be a bit more proactive? I've worked in monitoring control wells most of my career, and I think it's fair to say that nobody wants the bad news. Nobody wants to know that the water is going to the wrong place when they're injecting. So I think we do have a challenge with well integrity new technology is that, you know, we need to have a good understanding of what the implication of that's going to be and what we're going to be able to do about any of that. What we're going to be able to do about any problems that we find. So I think there's got to be a lot of engagement between not just would this technology tell us something we want to know about the well, but what we're going to do about it. So it's not just a case of finding things that are a problem, but what we're going to do to go about fixing new problems or fixing problems in new ways. So I think that's a big challenge that we have in terms of new technology is lots more bad news isn't necessarily what people get really excited about. What we need is to couple the new monitoring and the new knowledge about your wells with new solutions to fix them cheaper, better, faster, max related that sort of thing. Very good. And our session at the workshop will be split into measuring what matters inside the wells and also outside the wells. So we will have, you know, discussions about potentially detecting signs of potential leaks, methane emissions, etc. And I think there's some really exciting new technology in that area. You know, we've seen this NASA spin off methane sniffing technology that's been used in pipelines and other places at the moment. We've seen some things that allow abandoned wells or wells are maybe subsea that have unplanned releases. Sending off chemical triggers that can alert us to those kind of issues. So there are some really exciting things there. But we also need to talk to operators and work with operators to ensure that that new technology gets them solutions as well as new problems. Any more? Any more? If no other comments, we're going to go into questions from the audience and we've had a few good questions. So the first one is a bit contentious. So treat that with a bit of caution. But it comes from the SP Energy Stream website. And it is, are regulators capable of handling issues with abandoned and stranded wells when operators are not in the scene? I don't know if they're asking us to comment on the performance of your regulators. I don't feel particularly well qualified to do that. And I think, you know, that it depends an awful lot on what the legal regime is. You know, if the wells default back to, you know, say in the UK, it'd be the Crown waters or whatever. So they'd refer back to the government if they are entirely abandoned. But we've got this perpetuity legislation here, which means as long as the company exists, it will go further back to whoever drilled the well or the initial license holder until they find someone that's liable for it. So that's that's challenging. And it makes, I think, the North Sea much more cautious than it would be in other areas. Yeah, and I think in all fairness, it's not an easy question to answer in a few seconds or, or even in a few minutes. I can only say we will have regulators at the workshop present their own perspective on on their job and how complicated it can be. So if you want to know a bit more about that, feel free, feel free to join. We will have these these conversations. Another question. Sorry, if I could just comment very quickly on the workshop on that is that in the past, we've had regulators. In fact, I think we have one that was steamed around where the industry meets the regulator. And that's some of the most stimulating conversations we have. It's a real big pictures of what it is that we need to measure, how we're going to measure it, how we make it robust, and what the regulator is going to regulate. You know, and Kareem in CCUS is the early stage of helping the regulator. But those of us a lot more gray hair than Kareem have ever been. I've been through this cycle once or twice before. But in terms of the workshop, some of the most stimulating conversations we've ever had at those over the last decade or so have been those touch points between the regulators and the operators and service companies have to deliver the technology. It's a really stimulating part of the workshop in my opinion. Good. Excellent point. We'll take another question, which will also serve or actually will take a question on future proofing well integrity, which will relate to questions from the audience. So well integrity will play a key role to provide. Well, actually, the following considering the current demographics in the industry and the lack of interest for STEM for many students, how can we ensure we'll not only have the financial resources to manage aging wells, but also the competent workforce? And we had two questions from the audience directly related to that. And I think that's how we'll finish the discussion today. How to make the well integrity discipline attractive for talents or I think there was another one. Yeah, it was it was also related to the same thing how to attract people into well integrity. I genuinely think this is the biggest challenge that we have in well integrity. You know, to do anything in any industry, I think you need three things. You need the right ideas, the right money, and you need the right people. And I think through the well integrity technical section and these kind of workshops that we're talking about in March, that's where you get the right ideas. The money will be there, which is well, because you know, the oil industry is a lucrative business. So and the liability, so the downside of the money is also there, there will be incentives to make sure things happen. My biggest challenge, I think, that I see is that we attract the right kind of people into this industry. And it is the kind of things that SP does on the ground, going into schools talking about how exciting it is to work on, you know, engineering challenges, even in what are considered to be older industries. And there is an analogy in my lifetime when I was a teenager, I would say that, you know, a lot of the nuclear stuff that was being done in the UK, it was an unpopular energy generation system when 80s 90s when I was going through school and university and, and people weren't moving. into that. But there was an awful lot of work to be done on the decommissioning of some of these things. And now it's a resurgent energy source has seen as much cleaner than than other sources. So we've seen this cycle before of a dip in interest, and then a reimagining of that. But it's up to people like us, you know, individual leaders within the industry, individual SP members and other STEM ambassadors to go out and speak to schools and talk to people about how challenging, exciting and engineering career can be. Michael, perhaps, perhaps I think the topic was discussed at the with dinner at ATC. Was there any from your perspective or some of those conversations? Do you have any final words on on specifically on this? Thank you for that. Yes, we actually were asked to do the opening dinner at the technical conference last year, and it was sold in our keynote ExxonMobil and we had a really nice panel of surface and manufacturers, fielding questions on the workforce, very concerned from all stakeholders. You can imagine the academics that were seated all at one table. They came in, you know, where is my discipline going? I think one of the overall messages is that well integrity affects us all. Anything below the mud line, creating infrastructure. It's really important for us to convey that message of how you as individual, whether you're reservoir engineer, selecting spots for your wells in your field to someone that may be coming to do an intervention. We all have a role to play and understanding that our standards are around a guideline and a process. Knowing where you are in that process is really key. And the academics took that away as they and you know, maybe we should convey in this in most of our classes when it and this is petroleum engineering. Where we are along that process because we typically do a very silo and this is the academic speaking very siloed instruction program in well integrity kind of includes a lot of what we do and typically well integrity experts come out of a couple of decade of training and being boots on the ground, seeing what's going on in the field. Typically, well integrity experts come out of a couple of decade of training and being, you know, boots on the ground, seeing problems, resolving problems, working across the disciplines, working across the sector with service companies, technology innovators to prevent well integrity incidents from happening. So we'd like to see, you know, new graduates come out and have tools, digital tools, being able to predict these, these issues way ahead of time and prevent them. So yes, we do think that we have a kind of a different approach depending on the operator and company. So that's where we think we can we can make a difference. I know we're out of time here. So thanks. Perfect. So thanks. I would like to thank both both of the panelists and the audience for participating. I think it was a great session. If you want a richer exchange, feel free to join us at the workshop in March. There will be a full two day action packed, great event for networking, breakout sessions, takeaways, and we hope to leave the participants with food for thoughts at the end of this. There will be another WITS live event, SPE live event in April. So feel free to stay tuned. Watch that space for this as well. Thank you again."
SPE Live Podcast: The Future of Well Integrity,"Hi and welcome to the SPE Podcast. I'm Asha Robles, SPE's multimedia producer. Today's podcast is hosted by SPE's VP of Communications, Glenda Smith. She is joined by Terry Polish, petroleum engineering advisor at Carboceramics and longtime SPE volunteer. They discuss the importance of how to properly write a paper proposal. Thanks for joining me today, Terry. That's great to be here, Glenda. Even though we're in the virtual mode, it's good to be able to do these types of things. So you started your career with ARCO working in Alaska and then after ARCO was purchased, you spent some time as a high school math teacher. That had to be an interesting experience. Do you feel like you were able to influence any of your students towards engineering careers perhaps? Wow, that's a good question. I mean, first of all, I got into it because my parents and I come from a long line of a lot of teachers and I, so I probably came by it naturally and it's something I'd always wanted to do. So I took advantage of the opportunity. But, I taught math and I, for as silly as it sounds, I was always really excited when I was teaching my math classes. So I mean, Algebra 2 I taught mostly and then I had a little bit of math models and statistics. And I think when I taught math models particularly, it felt like I was able to offer people real world experiences or kids, real world experiences. And so I don't know whether it did, but I hope that my excitement or maybe even, there's a lot of times where you, I kind of looked at every student as a little engineering problem and you're trying to figure out how to impart the knowledge that I had into their brain. And so you worked on ways to do that. And I hope that sometime I maybe made it a little bit easier or made it not so ominous because so many students say, oh, you know what, my mom and dad were not good at math, so I'm not either. And that's not really true, right? That's, I think a lot of times kids gave up before they ever tried. And so, I don't know, it's hard to say. I only taught for four years. So I didn't, one thing I really do miss is that I wasn't able to see the students come back, you know, after they'd maybe gone to college and had been doing something with their lives. But I hope so. I mean, I at least tried to make it interesting. I think that's always fun to have the opportunity to influence a young mind. And yeah, it is kind of unfortunate that you didn't get to see how they come back and what they decided to do with it. But hopefully being an engineer yourself, you at least gave them some impetus in that direction. Well, you know, one of the things, projects we did in my math models class was a casino day and everybody had to build their own games and use probability. So at least at the bare minimum, they probably figured out where math maybe came into play in gambling. That's great. Maybe that gave them a useful skill going forward. So you're the author or co-author of more than 50 SPE papers. What led you to writing that first one? Well, when I worked for ARCO, I was in Alaska. And if you wanted to attend a conference, an SPE conference, you could either wait till your rotation, which, you know, typically took about five years before it kind of came back around to you, or you could write a paper. And so a colleague of mine both said, you know what, we want to go to New Orleans. And so we wrote a paper that was something an abstract for New Orleans and we got it. So we went. So that was quite frankly, that was the reason we did it. And I didn't feel like I was very good at it or anything, but we just wanted to go to the conference. That's great. So how has writing papers benefited your career? Well, believe it or not, when I first started with ARCO, I'll never forget during my first year or two during my development program, I remember my supervisor basically telling me, man, you are, I kept getting really low marks on technical writing, presentation skills and stuff. And I just thought, I got to do better than that. And I don't know that I started writing papers and making presentations because of it, but I can tell you that doing it certainly has helped me. And I've come to find that I, I'm not saying I'm good or bad at it, but I'm a lot more comfortable doing it than I ever was. So I think that's helped me a lot. And in my current job, you know, a lot of what I do is presentations. And I think, you know, I think having given papers and talks, I don't feel all that intimidated by it anymore. And then I, so I think that's helped. And then of course, I think the exposure, you're exposed to a lot of colleagues and people that you would never be exposed to if not. And, you know, it honestly, it feels good when you get done making them, giving the presentation and people come up to you asking you questions and things like that. And as much as I'm usually intimidated, usually people are intimidated by the questions you're going to get, but frankly, I'd much rather get questions and give that paper. And believe me, it's happened to me where I give the paper and I don't have a single question. I'm thinking, boy, that must have been pretty irrelevant to people sitting in here. So, but now I think that's kind of how it's helped me. That's great. I think, I think a lot of people have found that. I wrote some papers early in my career as well. I think I only have nine, but it helped me a lot with, with presentation skills and with reaching out and making connections to other people in the industry. And so I do think there's a lot of value for people there. So after, you know, after getting good at writing papers, you moved on to serving on programs and working on the you know, after getting good at writing papers, you moved on to serving on program committees and eventually on various subcommittees and the ATCE program committee being the chairman of the ATC program committee in 2017, 2018. So you've read a lot of paper proposals. I have, yes, more than I'd like to care. But yes, I have. In fact, I've read paper proposals before, you know, now you have, now you have kind of some guidelines. It's the abstract is kind of broken up into four parts for you, which makes your life a lot easier. But I read them before they were free format. And boy, that was, there were times that that was, that was a long process. I can only imagine, especially with the volume, with ATCE being the event that gets the most abstracts every year. And so in some respects, it's our most selective event. It's certainly, I can only imagine the volume of abstracts that go through that. And your experience led you to teach our how to write a good abstract session that we hosted ATCE in recent years. What was your motivation for that session? You know, it's funny, I actually, I started that because someone, I was involved with the Dallas section as well on the board of the Dallas section for many years on the program chair and chairman and stuff like that. And one of the guys, Danny Bell, who served with me on that board knew that I'd written a bunch of papers. And one day he was doing education, chair. And he said, Terry, I'd like to get to promote more paper writing in our section here. And would you be willing to put on a short how to write an abstract and how to write a paper class? And so it literally started with a four hour session for the Dallas section. And I really enjoyed that so much. And I think what happened was somebody from staff, SP staff saw me give that, I did it a couple of years and then asked me if I'd be willing to do that at the annual conference. And so of course, I jumped at the opportunity because it became something that I really enjoyed talking about. And I think it's, you know, I think it's good for people's careers. I think there's a lot of things that people don't, a lot of misnomers and misconceptions about writing papers and abstracts that's out there that I think sometimes cause people not to want to write a paper. And I wanted to kind of help promote that. And so that we get a lot of, you know, the way we can high grade and make our programs as good as possible is to get as many abstracts in there that we can evaluate. So, you know, it was kind of a two edge deal, but mostly it's just because somebody asked. And it was something that kind of was passionate to me. That's, isn't that the way so many things happen, right? So share with our listeners, what makes a good paper proposal? What information should they include? Well, maybe we, you know, I'd probably like to start with just what is an abstract. I mean, so what is, you know, we sometimes call it call for papers and the irony is we aren't calling for papers. We're actually calling for abstracts or pro proposals. And so the question probably is, well, what is that abstract for? So keep this in mind. I think it's basically your way to communicate to the reviewer why they should choose your paper or your abstract. I mean, it's a sales pitch and it's all about telling them what's going to be in the paper and why they should accept it. It's actually a portion of your abstract. When you actually write the paper, you'll write a more full length abstract. And by the way, that abstract is meant to hook readers who are searching the database and they read your abstract and say, okay, I want to take a look at this paper. So, but as far as this proposal goes, it's your sales pitch. So, you know, you need to be clear, you need to be concise. You don't have to use all the words that you're allotted. You know, a catchy title, things like that, I think are important. You know, think about what's important of the day. It's about the only time I'll typically recommend buzzwords. But, you know, if your paper has something to do with applications at unconventional reservoirs, then you should probably put that in your title, or at least in the abstract somewhere. If it's for an area or a field, the Bakken or, you know, what have you, then you should put that in there. You know, I like to think of it as, you know, if you were looking at a title and maybe the abstract, what is it that would catch your eye and that would make you want to read it and download it or attend it or whatever? So, you know, I think whatever you need to include in that abstract or that proposal that will help sell your paper or, excuse me, sell the proposal to the reviewers is what you might want to put in there. I'll give you a little secret. I don't know whether this helps or hurts, but I typically tell in my classes or on this, I, if you read out my abstracts, every one of my abstracts will have two statements in it somewhere. Somewhere it will say, this paper is going to blah, blah, blah. This paper will. This paper whatever. I mean, as funny as that sounds, a lot of times I read an abstract or proposal and I'm like, what are they going to be talking about in this paper? Because we tend to get into introductions and all this other stuff instead of just saying, hey, this paper is going to do this. So, if it's somewhere in there can say that, at least as a reviewer, it kind of focuses me on that. And then the other thing I'll typically say is, you know, this paper would be useful too, or this paper will benefit who? And that way it kind of, and usually I put that at the end and that kind of helps that reviewer know, okay, so this is who this is our target audience is for and things like that. So, I don't know, those are just some of the pointers I have that I usually tell the people. But, you know, the key is to be clear and concise and just try to sell it as well as you can on paper. Great. I think that's great advice. You mentioned catchy title. I know I've seen some in the past where people have tried to be so clever that the title doesn't convey what the paper is actually about. And later when you see that on the program, assuming it was chosen, someone who's just scanning down the program and is really only seeing the titles and the authors might not know what that paper is about. And so they might not choose to attend it. So is there a balance between, you know, being clever or catchy and still communicating what the thing is about clearly? Well, yeah, okay. So first of all, the one thing I would be really careful of is don't be so general, you know, a field study that optimizes production in an unconventional reservoir. I mean, those are just a bunch of buzzwords that don't really mean a lot of things to you. So, you know, put the name of the play, if it's a case history, say that it's a case history, you know, things like that. But, yeah, I always, what I always tell people is this, if you, I have seen some really catchy, cool titles. I think it's, you have to be really careful. There's a fine line there. But it's certainly doable. Just make sure that you do, you know, if you're catchy or clever, maybe is the right word, then make sure that it still conveys what's in that paper. Because otherwise, you're right, a person may look at it and think, okay, I'm just going to go on to the next thing. But, you know, I think there is a time and a place for kind of some clever things. And if you have the ability to be clever with your title, I think it's a good thing. Because then it again, it's going to catch the eye of the reviewer as well. I think asking some colleagues to read it and comment on it, give you some feedback after you've written it is probably a good way to make sure that you are communicating what the paper is about. Now, not your co-authors, of course, because they already know what the paper is about. But some people who haven't been involved in the process, who might be able to give you some feedback on whether or not you've correctly communicated what you're at, what you're planning to talk about. Yeah, I, you know, I talked to, I, as usually as a part of my class, I talked about writing the paper and making the presentation. And one of the things I stress over and over again is to have others read your abstract, have others view your presentation, have others, you know, all those things. Because you, what happens is you get so, I find that after I've read and written over and over and over again on the same paper, that you just start to get immune to it. And you kind of know what you're trying to say, but you kind of forget the fact that you're just not saying it very well anymore. So yeah, I think it's, it's really critical to do that. And as a matter of fact, I will usually wait until I get it in a pretty final form to take it to some pretty key people, people that maybe don't even have a lot of background in the, in the subject matter and let them read it then. In other words, if you let them read it three or four times, they're going to become just like you again, they're going to know what it is about again. So I, I usually do some final, have some people read it on a final basis to make sure, you know, it's conveying what, what you want them to convey. And, you know, and obviously make sure it's people who'll be candid with you. You don't want people are just going to agree because they're afraid to tell you what they think. So I think it's important. Absolutely. What else should potential authors consider as they're trying to get the, you know, the process going? Well, okay. That's, that's another good question. So if there's, there's probably two or three things that I would say you need to think about. First of all, deadlines. Okay. For the most part, there aren't extensions. There's almost never an extension on an abstract, you know, but there's not typically extension. So, you know, look online, they will tell you in the call for papers, you know, what the deadlines are going to be. So make sure you can hit those deadlines. Make sure you'll have all your data together by that time. Maybe make sure you'll have all your testing done if you're doing testing or what have you. So, so make sure you're going to be able to meet the deadlines. Second thing you need to do is make sure you understand your company's approval process. Some companies require the abstract to be approved. Some people just, some just require the paper, but at least make sure you think you understand the approval process and the timing to do that. Cause some companies take longer than others. And, you know, you might just make sure that they're going to approve it. You know, there are some things that you know, your company probably wouldn't approve, or maybe you don't know that, but you might want to ask. And then the other thing is start, consider your co-authors and their deadlines. So my company is, doesn't have a lot of strict guidelines on deadlines. In fact, I help approve a lot of the papers, but, but some of my co-authors I know take a month. And so you have to account for theirs, them in the deadlines as well. And then I, let me just also say this. If, if you're a service company and you are, look, by and large, if you're a service company and you're writing a paper, you, you are probably talking about a product or a service or something that you at your service company did with an operator, probably. And one of the things that we are looking very critically for in our reviewing is the low level of commerciality. If we think there's going to be any hint of commerciality in your paper, you will be low rated and may not make the cut. So what I, the reason I bring that up is because if you're a service company, which is what I am, I work for a service company, I try to work really hard to find co-authors from the operator who are willing to put their name on the paper. Because if I'm a reviewer and I see that there's an operator on there as well, it makes me feel a little bit better about it being a non-commercial paper. Now, that doesn't mean you can't get a paper in without an operator as a co-author. It's not at all what that means. It just means you're going to have to work pretty hard to make sure it doesn't look, it isn't a commercial piece of work. But that's one thing to think about with your co-authors. You know, we don't look at it and say, oh, wow, they got 10 co-authors, more co-authors you have, the better chance. Now, there's none of that stuff. It has no bearing on it whatsoever. But you know, who the co-authors work for and stuff like that, I think that's important as a way to look at that. And one other thing I forgot to mention on the approvals, also make sure that you're going to be able to travel. Now, obviously, right now, we don't know and I'm sure everybody's up in the air. And so it's hard to say, but let's just set COVID-19 aside and all the issues go and all of that. Under normal circumstances, you should probably make sure that you believe you're going to be able to travel to the conference. Because if you don't, if no one presents your paper, whether it's you or your co-author or a colleague, unfortunately, the paper gets pulled. So it won't go into OnePetro. So just make sure somebody ought to be able to be presented. That's an excellent point. I know a lot of people really want not only to travel to an ATCE or something like that to have that experience, but also that holy grail of having your paper in OnePetro is important. But there is the policy we've instituted that if your paper isn't presented, we pull it from the proceedings and it is no longer in OnePetro. So authors definitely need to be aware of that. Just getting your abstract through is not a guarantee of getting a paper into OnePetro. I think that's important for people to understand.

So you gave us a little bit of hint, but obviously a program committee can sometimes only accept one in ten or fewer of the proposals that are submitted. So how do they select which papers will make the best program? Well, so look, we try really hard to make this a subjective process. Or, yeah, you know, we don't want to, we're trying to get out, get away from, or be very objective, I guess. We're trying to get away from favorites and all that stuff. So some of the things we do, first of all, is we ask reviewers if you're a colleague or if you're on the paper and stuff to kind of recuse yourself. But the way the process works is most program committees or subcommittees are made up of, I'd say, 10 to 15 individuals that serve three-year terms. That we try to put these program committees together to have a mix of operators and service companies, but still have the subject matter expertise. And they, all of the, there's a deadline, of course, for the proposal. Everybody then is asked to rate the proposals from one to six. And I think you can use half, so 1.5, 2.5, so on. And, you know, if all goes as planned, everybody reviews and rates every paper. We then take the average. The program chair takes the average of the ratings of each one of the papers and then we rank them from top to bottom. And by and large, we know that, okay, we get, say, completions, the ATCE is going to have six sessions, five papers per session, so we have 30 papers. We're going to also include two to three alternates. So that's, you know, whatever that ends up being, another nine, or yes, 12 more. So we know that we're going to be able to put 45 or 50 papers into the program between actual presentations and alternates. And then we go ahead and we go down and we make the cutoff at, you know, the top 50 or whatever it is. Now, you know, as we then put them together, we will try to look at, you know, papers that were maybe just below or maybe just maybe in the line because, honestly, it's not at all uncommon for, you know, the cutoff to be 4.71 and there was a paper at 4.72 and a paper's at 4.7. And so it literally comes down to that sometimes. So we try our best if there's something that looks like it maybe just didn't quite make it, we might put it in and add another alternate or whatever. But by and large, it's just really, it's just how well those papers are rated. And, you know, hopefully everybody, the way we work it is, you know, hopefully everybody kind of does their rating in the same system. So, you know, some people maybe is more critical, some are not, but as long as they do them all the same way, then it all averages out. So, you know, that's kind of how it works. Unfortunately, as you said, some of the really high volume flagship programs like ATCE, HFTC, OTC, you know, Eartech, some of these, you know, the acceptance is going to typically be in the teens. And so that means, you know, you have a one or two out of 10 chance of being accepted. So it's pretty stiff competition. And I guess what I want to, I want to make sure everybody understands is if you don't get accepted, don't be discouraged. It may just, I mean, it's typically stiff competition there. But what I would do if I'm not accepted, is I would then take that and I would try to go to a regional conference or something that usually has a little bit less pressure on it. But I would also get that abstract review by somebody. I'd make sure someone else looks at it and says, you know, find it, make sure there wasn't some fatal flaw in there. But don't be discouraged if you're not accepted to one of these big conferences, to one of these big conferences, because they are hard to get in. They're very exclusive, some of them. Well, right now we have a number of open calls for papers for events coming up in later this year and early into next year. So there's lots of opportunities for people to write papers right now. Any other recommendations for or advice for people who might be considering writing their very first SPE paper? Yeah, I'll give you two pieces. So first of all, when you write that proposal, you need to treat that proposal like your resume or your CV. You know, when you turn in a resume or a CV to a company for a job, nobody is typically going to call you up and say, could you explain what you mean by this on your resume? They're either going to get it or not, and they're either going to call you back or they're not. And that's the same thing that happens with an abstract or a proposal. Nobody on the conference committee or program committee is going to call you up and ask you for clarification. They're either going to understand or not. So be really clear and be really concise and make sure you are answering the questions. But the other thing is, you know, it's funny, I talk to more people, a lot of people come to my presentation, especially younger, you know, first timers for papers, and they just say, you know, I'd like to write, I really would like to write a paper, but I just don't have anything to write about. And I would contend that with very few exceptions, I think everybody's got a paper in them. You know, you have your day-to-day job and you're doing things, you're solving problems, you know, you're overcoming challenges or whatever. And think about it, when you go to a conference, that's exactly what you like to hear, don't you? I mean, you like to go, you like to hear about how someone else had their problem and solved their problem, you know, the steps they took or whatever. I mean, that's what we call case histories. And if I think everybody's got those. And so I would, I would really encourage you to think about that and see if you can't find something that you might be able to write about. First timer, I would recommend probably going to a regional conference. I think it's less pressure there, less pressure to get the paper in, but also, you know, you won't have a room full of 400 people, you might have a room full of 50 people, and maybe that'll be a little less intimidating the first time as well. So I think those would be my two pieces of advice. I think that's great. I should have thought if I had a piece of advice to offer as well, because having done this myself, although I admit my first paper was also at a regional conference. So I think that does make a difference and give you a little more comfort in terms of trying to make that first presentation, where it's natural to, oh my gosh, I'm looking at all these faces and they're expecting me to say something important. And I'm just talking about what I did in my work and I'm hoping they'll find it interesting. So any last tips for authors that we that we ought to share before I have something else I was going to ask you about while I got to? I mean, you know, once you do start writing the paper, by the way, proof, proof, proof, make sure you have people who look that over and proofread it for you. And your presentation, I just want to throw out one thing. When you're practicing your presentation, practicing your presentation is not sitting in front of your computer screen, advancing slides, and in your mind thinking about what you're going to say. Practicing your presentation is standing up and presenting it on a screen or maybe it's at your computer, but you're standing there and you are literally timing yourself and you are saying the words as if you're presenting the paper. And even better if you could do it in front of an audience, maybe colleagues or whatever. But that's practice. And if you want to become smooth at presenting, that's the way you have to practice. So anyway, that's great. So, Bob, am I? No, absolutely great advice. I read something recently that talked about you can't practice too much for a presentation. The more you practice, the better you are at it. And it really is important to take that time to make sure that you're not going to be stumbling over your words, as I've been, and be fluent in those kind of situations, especially if you get a little stage fright in front of people. Having practiced, you'll be more comfortable. I think one final thing I would add from the SPE perspective is to make sure everybody knows SPE does do a plagiarism check on all papers as they come through. And if we discover there is a high degree of plagiarism in your paper, even self-plagiarism, it will flag and we will be having a conversation about it. So that's a reminder for everyone as well. And Glenda, can I add something there? Absolutely. I would say the far majority of the plagiarisms that we see are self-plagiarism. And so you're not doing that on purpose, but you're writing a paper that maybe it's a subsequent to another paper or it's related to another paper you wrote and whatever. And you write the same thing you wrote before because you look at it and whatever. That's our biggest problem is people who self-plagiarize. So just make sure you cite your own work when that happens. Yeah, self-plagiarism is usually a fairly easy fix. But it's the other part that's not. Well, Terry, I appreciate you taking the time and I think you've given our potential paper authors some great advice about how they can write their first or second or third paper. Well, I hope so. I have enjoyed it. I always enjoy talking about this topic. It's kind of something that's near and dear to me. I enjoy doing it. And so yeah, hopefully a couple people or more will decide to try their hand at it. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live Pre-ATCE Series, HSE and Sustainability, Tangible Pathways. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on September 18th, 2023. And now your moderator, Philippe Hervé. Welcome to this SPE Live Pre-ATCE Series on HSE and Sustainability, Tangible Pathways. My name is Philippe Hervé and I'm the director at PG Energy, a consulting company that focuses on all-on-gas technology, energy and business development. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. This event is an introduction to the special session on HSE, which will take place at ATCE in San Antonio on October 16th. We have two speakers today, one from each part. And in ATCE in San Antonio, they will be joined by leaders from the largest operating company. I encourage you today to ask questions as soon as possible. And while our speakers are answering the questions that we have for them, we will answer as many questions as possible from the audience in the time we have. It is my pleasure to introduce our guests. Wafik Bedoun is a director for America at IOGP and promotes his practice in upstream operation and in the low-carbon energy transition to IOGP members. Wafik's extensive career, including being the president of CEO of Total Energy Research and Technology. We also have today Darcy Spadi, who is the managing director at Carbon Connect International, a Calgary-based company that specializes in emission reduction, training, baseline measurements, quantification and decarbonization implementation. Darcy was most able for being our president in 2018. Wafik, Darcy, welcome to this SPE Live. Good morning and welcome. Good afternoon, good evening, something. Yes. Well, good morning and good afternoon, yes, to all of you. It's a pleasure to be here. And we have the pleasure of having Wafik and Darcy both in the same room today in Calgary, or somewhere in Canada, at least. Thank you. So let's start because we have only 30 minutes. And I would like to ask a question on sustainability and carbon emission and maybe Darcy, with your background, you're the best position to get started also. I'd love to hear Wafik's thoughts on this one. But how can the oil and gas industry effectively balance its energy needs with the imperative of achieving net zero carbon emission by 2050? What innovative strategies or technology holds the most promises in this journal? That's a big question, Philippe. And by the way, thank you. Thank you for hosting this. You know, when I first met you, you were getting involved in the data side. And this was 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. I don't know. So you are the expert on the artificial intelligence and data side. How can the industry deal with this? And this is a huge question, a huge issue. I have to step back and I say we have no choice, actually. The public needs energy. Energy poverty is real. And we're the experts. So I think we must we must have a solution. And we must have while we give the solution, we must build the perception that we're helpers and not hinders. And we're both at the opening ceremony of the World Patrol and Congress last night. And how many people from our federal ministers in Canada to the local premier, to the head of the C, everybody's talking about the same thing. But we're the doers. So how how do we effectively balance the energy needs? I have no idea, but we have no choice. In my opinion, we have no choice. What do you think? I can't agree more. We're a group of engineers and what we need is to convince. Stakeholders at large. And so I think it's a complex situation. I'll share maybe. An experience I had in mid 2000. My first experience was in the United States. My first CCS project I was involved in. And we wanted to inject CO2 and monitor CO2 in a depleted reservoir. This reservoir produced during 50 years gas that contained H2S. So it's in France. And so we made the case and we had to convince the society about that project. So we had a lot of resistance and they were concerned. That the CO2 we will be injecting will see and start going through the seal and the subsurface reaching their vineyards. So the vineyard guys were concerned saying, you're going to kill all my crops and I won't be able to produce. And we were telling them, can you imagine you had 50 years of H2S and we contain that and now we're just injecting. So the whole point here is let us not underestimate the effort it takes us to convince the stakeholders at large that are not engineers and that we need really to understand how they're looking at these kind of challenges. I'm going to moderate in Khalid's spot. Do we need to convince or do we need to be? We need to be better, more holistic citizens. I think the experience is we need to get out of our engineering mindset box. Exactly. Understand where they're coming from, analyze and probably it's very bold. But imagine we are hired by them to prove that it is something that's worthwhile for them. So it learned a lot. I think it's rational being more rational won't help. It's not the point. It's understanding them and not just convincing them by our argument. We need to understand their arguments and go through that. Why not? He says the label contains sulfites, right? So it helps. Thank you, Moafiq and Darcy. Very good answer to the first part of the question. Maybe can you have some thing you want to say on the innovative strategies on technology, which are really promising at this point of time? I mean, what are you seeing on which really seems to be happening today that is changing how fast we can progress on this objective? You know, as an industry, we have proven that we can handle technology. I think if you take a look back and see the kind of technological innovation we've had over the years, we are we are the best. And and so if anybody can handle this using a or any sort of data usage or skill, we're there. We're SP members are energy experts. So I have great faith, maybe not in me and my age group, but but I have great faith in new SP members. They will they will actually figure out the technology. I've never seen it not happen from horizontal wells, the multistage fracturing to control devices to downhole deep sea depths like water depths. We've done it and we've done it quickly. Yes, yes, I think. Yeah. And again, the issue about technology and the use of technology is quite complex. We have the technology evolution from, let's say, going from a experiment pilot and then you prove the concept and things like that. And so and standards and regulation. So there's a whole suite of criteria to to validate the technology. I think for IOGP, at least, and IOGP hadn't mentioned that this International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, it's a community of practice of best practices on topics that include energy transition. And we've been working a lot on CCS and on methane and any kind of flaring and control. And so we've been coming up with such good practices on CCS. It's a technology that is, again, going to be instrumental not only to capture the CO2, but even when you want to generate blue hydrogen. There's a lot of CO2 that's emitted, so we need to capture them. So CCS seems to be one of the technologies. I think that the industry could have a big role in scaling it up. OK, thank you so much. And Darcy, you spoke about artificial intelligence, you know, you know, that I like that. So let me go to the question on the AI on HSSC. So what I'd like to know, maybe what could be best to get started on the answer. But I look forward to both of your thoughts on this one. So artificial intelligence has been targeted as a catalyst for improving health, safety, security, environment, all of our objectives. How is the industry really viewing AI to accelerate anti-dermal prevention and safety enhancement? Where do we stand today? So, undoubtedly, AI is having an impact, a huge potential also on our sector and other industries. So it's already showing its capabilities. NIO GP, our members have been working in the digitalization of our processes, our IGB process for some time. But in January of this year, we kicked off a digital transformation committee, DTC, to derive really the foundational elements on analytics, machine learning, AI that moves us forward as an industry towards a collective HSSC enhancement. So safety in particular. And safe sites is the first topic that we're considering is a key focus area for AOGP. And the DTC committee derived recently a safety roadmap, mapping the horizons. The horizon one is what we have today. Horizon two is what we see as emerging and horizon three is what we could be disruptive. But we're again working collectively as an industry, for instance, machine vision for risk and hazard identification is in horizon three. But we know that some of our members consider that in horizon two. But as a collective group, that's where we map that kind of roadmap. I'll talk more about it on our panel on October 16. But I'm trying to show you that IOGP is one part of the puzzle of AI use in the oil and gas industry. There's a lot happening by our members also. And so it's a collective type of approach where there's competition on the operator side when they go ahead and they develop these kind of the technologies from IOGP. It's more a collective cooperation mindset. Yeah. So this this artificial intelligence discussion this is so relevant because as petroleum engineers, are we are we data people? Should we get a degree in data management and then a minor in subsurface engineering? Are we petroleum engineers or are we data experts? This is a tough question. I don't know which comes first. I think being petroleum engineers or energy experts is first. But the next generation has to be data experts. The data expertise is so critical. And I like what you said about the three horizons. I mean, this is it gets so in depth. And when I started petroleum engineering, you know, I kind of liked it because nobody could prove your work. You know, we think the reservoir is doing this, therefore we'll build this. And if it responds this way, we must be right. But with the amount of data analysis available, we now have to have better answers and we can have tighter and tighter zones, tighter and tighter safety criteria and grind more with AI. We can be way better, but we have to be data experts. So I think this is really fitting and I think we are going to embrace this technology more than any other industry. And I think we're in very well. Providing energy to the world for that. So you're asking the question, I should be asking them, you're asking questions. I'm going to provide the answer instead of asking the question, because you ask on artificial intelligence and whether we should be domain expert or data experts. I'm 100 percent convinced we need to have domain experts. Artificial intelligence is a tool which is booming right now. But at one point of time, we learn how to use mechanical engines. And at one point of time, we learn how to use computers and we learn how to use Excel and PowerPoint. And now we got AI, just the next tool, which we need to actually to learn how to use. But unless you have your domain expertise and you know what you're speaking about, you're going to be irrelevant or misguided. So don't ever forget to be a domain expert. That's where you are. You are bringing real value to the company. Let's switch a little bit on collaborative approach. And I know you're doing a lot of work in that area with IOGP. So we have a lot of very ambitious goals to achieve net zero carbon emission on HSEC improvement. And that requires collaboration between industry players, policymakers, academia, the public. So how do we foster this environment to ensure this collective progress towards these goals? I mean, what is IOGP doing or what should the industry be doing in order to achieve that goal? There is a big project in SP called the GAIA program. And I think this is they have tried a lot of different ways to engage different stakeholders and bring them together. I think there's a lot of lessons learned from from that. And I think it's important to get the most influential stakeholders in together in the room and trying to address that. And it goes back to experience I had in the early 2000 with that kind of environmental licensing. I think it's not clear to the global stakeholders that we're part of the solution. We believe so, but we need to demonstrate it in different ways. And so engaging with authorities is key. I think policymakers in particular, they would call us lobby or advocacy, things like that. But it's part of our role to explain what we're doing with data science based type of arguments. And here criticism, we need to be able to explain able to hear criticism and come back and try to address them. In the example I was saying in CCS, we needed to demonstrate for the vineyard owners to guarantee that during 50 years, no CO2 will go up in their vineyard. How do you guarantee that in the future? So we had to explain the risk analysis. It took time, took three years to convince them. So I think it's a long term. It's a complex for one industry to tackle alone. We are doing a lot in engaging with regulators, policymakers in Europe in particular, in the Americas also, but in America it's more fragmented by country. But it's a long term endeavor. I don't know, you have some experience too. Yeah, policy is so important. And one of the differentiators in our industry is you have different ownership of resources. So in a lot most countries of the world, the Crown or the government, in our case, we call it the Crown, owns the resource. So it's easy for the government who owns the resource to tell the national oil company or the operators when they sell them the rights, you have to do this and here's the policy. It's a little tougher if the resource is owned by freehold or landowners because their interests are not the same as a government entity. But I think in all cases, policy, policy, policy to have good policy years ahead, decades ahead, we're achieving amazing methane reduction goals here in Alberta because we started on policy 15 years ago. So it's collaboration, it's use of data, but it's building good policy from the political side. So good luck with that, us. Thank you, very interesting feedback. We have actually a question here that came in through LinkedIn from Amin Amin. And so the question is on the screen, but oil and gas majors are stepping into the direct RCO2 capture, which you just spoke about, Rafik. How critical is this to reaching 2015 net zero objectives? Is this an oil and gas technology or just a business initiative? Okay, I appreciate that. I mean, I think there are several CCS technologies direct, their culture is one. There are members who are investing heavily on it. It's worth trying. There are others, I think. So at this point in time, I think it's dependent on regions on the proximity to the CO2 emissions. Also, cost of power, cost of power. It could be deployed anywhere, but one needs to know that the percentages of CO2 in air is very low. Very, very low. So you need to, I don't remember if it's under 1%, even 1000s, but it's a very small amount. So it requires a lot of capture or from air, but it is a technology that needs to be piloted and that's what some members are doing. I would just echo and say to Afik's answer and say all of the above. We are energy experts. We're petroleum engineers. The world wants to hear about energy transition. All of the above, whether it's CCS or methane reduction or direct air capture or some guy with sticky gloves getting CO2 out of the air. I don't care. All of the above. Let's be, let's be good scientists. Okay. Thank you. I still encourage our audience to ask more questions. We'd love those one when they come in. Let me go with my next question, which is a question on ethical and regulation considerations. A bit of a tricky one, but as we are as a potential of artificial intelligence and innovative technology, what ethical consideration should guide the adoption of these tools in the realm of sustainability and HSC? How can we ensure that AI aligns with both industry needs and broader societal values? That's a tough one. And I think that we have to start, we have to start with the data. So I started my career after university in the logging world and you know, logging data is really important and does a lot of things and that data was protected and in various jurisdictions protected or shared in different ways. And I think we can concentrate on protecting data and I'm going to worry less about the ethical part because I think that comes first of all, who owns the data and who's right is it to use it? So we start with the things we know and we can do well. And to me that that is the use of data. Every oil and gas operator wants all the data for themselves and nobody else ever. Every jurisdiction wants the data for everybody and not uniquely to the oil and gas operator. First, we make sure the data is fairly held and distributed and then go from there and the ethical considerations are more of a data industry thing down the road as far as individual data, people's data, if you will. I think we need to concentrate on who's the critical technical data is and the rest will flow. Maybe that's a callous answer, but man, we can fight over data. Any comments? I second that. I think we need to test. There's a lot. The whole end-to-end transition will involve a lot of experimentation and AI is one perfect tool to learn, experiment. I mean the whole machine learning is that you need reliable data. There's been a lot of lessons learned from using data and finding that the AI doesn't know how to distinguish even an x-ray and things like that. So with machine learning. So yeah, I think the experimental phase, we need to understand technologies need time to mature and we even have TRL scales, technology readiness levels is one example of maturity that NASA used to again put stages in how the technology matures. You will not use a technology commercially if it's not in TRL say 7, 8 or 9 out of a scale of 9. So there are risks involved. Policy needs to be written not too early because you need to test. So I think the whole, I mean to answer with your question, Philippe, I would say experimentation. Having more pilots is key to making any kind of AI technology robust to address some of our issues in the industry. Thank you so much. We actually have a question coming straight from the field from a rig and so, you know, you're building listen by people over the world and even at the rig side, they're listening to you guys and so what our people in the field are asking is a question on the data analyst work and the difference between working on memory data and real-time data. How do you compare it? A lot of the work in the field is done on memory data because maybe real-time data is not yet fully available. I thought we were more advanced but it looks like we still have a lot of memory data. How do you compare memory data from real-time data? You guys have any information on this? Anything you want to speak about? I'll start while Wafik is thinking. He'll have a better answer ultimately. You know what? We're from the Society of professionals in energy that stands for SP doesn't it? And because we're professionals in energy, we understand data. Data. Well, right, right, right Philippe and data is always coming from somewhere. Well worse than memory data is estimated data. So to me the question is about memory data versus real-time and we'll get good at that. We'll get good at converting memory data to real-time data. That's because we're professionals in energy but worse than that is the estimated data before even the memory data before even the real-time data. So I'm in a I'm in a part of the industry now where we're talking about methane emissions and it's largely estimates. Well, I want to ask each of you when you're driving down a highway you estimate how fast you're driving. Is that correct? I don't think so. So we love to double estimates or half estimates. We're seeing in methane data that it's twice. It's a factor of two. We're either half or double. So first of all, we go from estimates to memory or collective data to real-time. I think we'll get there but it's going to take a few iterations. I think Natalie, thank you for your question. So how do you compare it? I think it's a process. We're still in that experimentation. We start with memory data what we have dealing with real data requires much more computer power to be able to analyze real data and on the fly trying to have analytics done. You need to remove the outliers data that are not considered as representative, but I think it's we will be heading there like driveless cars uses real data in real time and you had it has to take decisions. So I think we're getting there. We're getting there, but I think we should tell H&P rig 549 that rate of penetration isn't everything good hole conditions are important. So just remember that. Very good. Thank you so much guys. Another question that I have here is on technology integration and in the pursuit of sustainability, how can we integrate renewable energy sources like wind solar energy, take energy storage combine those as you know, in as a tool in technologies that are like CCUS in order to pave the way for more efficient energy landscape. What are the challenges on the opportunities that are available to us with this type of integration? We have two minutes left. We better hurry. I think that's again another data challenge the power operators the system grid operators. Do you have some brownouts from time to time? We have people freezing to death in the winters because they can't get their energy. So I don't know the exact answer, but I would suggest we as Energy experts need to solve this and solve it quickly. Yeah, I would just add it's the way I see it is depends on the energy mix. That's it's a very regional local that kind of integration will occur depending on what locally you have if you have more wind in a place you would more focus on wind and maybe other sources that can address the trilemma. Also, it's very important. So yeah, it's a regional challenge. We cannot have a global solution for that. It depends people places who have more solar don't favor more for the whole place. And so but I think it needs integration. Yes, we need to shift to more low carbon emissions or technologies. So yeah, that's the idea is to have more that kind of balance of energies wherever we are the world tied with good data. Yes. I like your comment working on local versus global. I think there's a lot of you know, low-cost maybe not a cost but low low low hanging solution that we could capture by looking at that what's available locally and then expand from there. So absolutely agree with you there. Once again, I would like to thank our audience and thank our speaker for this wonderful interaction on providing us with all this great insight into what's happening. You will hear a lot more on this at ATCE annual conference in San Antonio where there will be hundreds of papers presented on lots of very good other discussion. We have an afternoon on Monday, October 16th from 2 to 5 p.m. dedicated to special sessions on HSC on sustainability. Darcy will be part of the first panel on tangible pathway to net zero carbon emission. Wafik will be on the second panel on artificial intelligence as a catalyst to accelerate HSC objective. They will be joined by industry leaders from the largest operators Shell Total. I mean everybody will be there and it's going to be a fantastic opportunity for you to come on a small question. So I look forward to seeing everyone in San Antonio and thank you for your time.

SPE Live Podcast: Accelerating the Value with Women Talent in Oil and Gas,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Gaia Talk, COP28, oil and gas insights from the Blue Zone. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on December 19th, 2023. And now your moderator, Trey Schaefer. Welcome to this SPE Live Gaia Talk. Our conversation today is going to cover COP28, oil and gas insights from the Blue Zone. My name is Trey Schaefer. I am the SPE Sustainable Development Technical Section Chair and Gaia Chair. I'm also a senior partner with DRM and I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions during the program. We'll have to type those into the chat. And it's my pleasure now to introduce our guests. First, I'd like to introduce Brian Sullivan. Brian joined IPCA as the Executive Director in 2011 following a 23-year career in BP. He graduated in metallurgy and material science from Imperial College in London. And he was recruited into BP's refining and marketing international, he was recruiting into BP's refining and marketing international graduate program in 1986. During his time with BP, Brian had a varied career of financial leadership roles across the downstream value chain including crude and product trading, marine fuels, lubricants, and alternative energy. During his tenure at IPCA, he has overseen the growth of the association and leads their contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, and the Energy Transition. Brian is also a fellow of the Energy Institute. Next, I'd like to introduce Arthur Lee. Arthur is Chevron's fellow and Senior Strategy Advisor with the Energy Transitions Team within Chevron's Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Group. Arthur participated and continues to participate in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC process since the third assessment report from 2001. The IPCC recognized him and other researchers with a certificate for contributions to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Further, he continues to participate in the IPCC in its sixth assessment serving currently as a review editor. Arthur was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to serve as a member of the National Climate Assessment Development and Advisory Committee from 2011 to 2014 for which he received a signed recognition letter from President Barack Obama in 2014. And finally, I'd like to introduce David Hohn, who works for Shell International. He is the Chief Climate Change Advisor in the Shell Scenarios Team. He joined Shell in 1980 after graduating as a chemical engineer from the University of Adelaide in Australia. He has worked in refinery technology, oil trading, and shipping areas for Shell. David is also a board member of C2ES in Washington and GCCSI in Melbourne and is a former board member of the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA, which he chaired from 2011 to 2013. Lastly, David is also the author of the 2017 book on climate change, Putting the Genie Back, Solving the Climate and Energy Dilemma. Brian, Arthur, and David, welcome to SBE Live. I think it's important to remember that the starting point for this COP was what was called the Global Stock Take. And that is the, this is the first global stock take, meaning that it's the first point in the Paris Agreement where nations and the UNFCCC actually look at how we're going in terms of mitigation, adaptation, finance, and all of the various aspects of the Paris Agreement. And this, of course, not surprisingly, the finding was that we're not on track to the goals of the Paris Agreement. We're certainly not on track to 1.5. And so it set us up for what was called the UAE consensus, which was the document coming out. And it set up a process that led to some pretty bold ambition on the deployment of renewables, the deployment of nuclear and electric vehicles and so on. But it also, of course, led to quite an acrimonious discussion about the future role of fossil fuels in the energy mix. And I'm sure many people followed this where we started off with the desire for phasing out fossil fuels. But, of course, we ended up with transition away from fossil fuels. And there was a lot of applause and backslaping about this, but it was a difficult discussion. But nevertheless, one that the UAE managed to get over the line and create this consensus. So let's continue on and give the audience a little bit of a deeper dive. Because as well as these very high profile negotiations that went on and which were widely reported in the media, there was, of course, very important work being done around other aspects of the Paris Agreement. And whilst the UAE consensus was a difficult challenge and one that the government did a great job in getting over the line, that wasn't the case with the negotiations around what is called Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. And this is the mechanism within the Paris Agreement that allows cross-border trade of carbon units so that countries can cooperate in reaching their national goals. And whilst a great deal of this has been agreed, the detail is really challenging the negotiators to settle on. And at the COP, we unfortunately saw an end to the current negotiations where they were not able to agree on the detailed implementation of the mechanism to allow projects to take place to generate carbon credits. This was what's known as Article 6.4 and is widely seen as the successor for the clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. I think it's important to note that what David had said about the trouble with 6.4. 6.4 definitely will be a year delay, but I just want to emphasize, I think David said it already, but 6.2, paragraph 2, was already agreed to in Glasgow at COP 26. So it's important to remind ourselves of that and that the detailed rules at the time are still operating. So 6.2 is still there and it is important to know that because countries are still signing up with each other, these bilateral agreements to be able to trade these internationally transferred mitigation outcomes or IPMOS. So that is still happening and countries are still doing that. What was at stake here at COP 28 were really issues that are perhaps a bit more minor, but also there was a linkage to 6.4 that could not be helped. And so it caused 6.2 to fail. It has to, but again, the rules that are more granular now, much more about consistency between countries do not have to be adopted for countries to be able to do their own agreements and sign up and make rules themselves of what they could trade. The 6.2 negotiations that happened and that failed this time really were much more granular and more about future consistency. So I'll just leave it there because even though that is not the headline, the global stock take all the headlines, there are other issues as well in terms of global goal on adaptation, because that's important to understand too. And adaptation is also an important part. It's I think Article 7 of the Paris Agreement. And that is also very important to countries in this long term approach to climate change. You have the 1.5 degrees and you have two degrees in the mitigation goal, but there's never been any kind of goal really for adaptation. And now they're negotiating that as well, setting up the framework for that, which was agreed. But the details of that has not been agreed and that will continue. Thank you. Thank you, Arthur. Maybe Brian, you know, as an observer and a participant in a number of these events, were there any highlights or differences from COP 28 compared to the prior COPs that you've attended that were noticeable that you could sort of share with everyone? I guess the two main differences were very much linked to the location. So this was by far the biggest COP that there has been. I think the statistics said there was something approaching 70,000 people who registered in the Blue Zone, which is where the parties to the agreement, the countries plus the observer states, observer organizations can attend. So in terms of scale, the number of people involved and everything like that, that was a very significant feature. I guess Dubai had Expo City available and they decided to fill it up. And they certainly did that both in terms of the Blue Zone, as I mentioned, but also the Green Zone, which was like a sort of enormous trade fair showing with many companies showing off technologies and what they're aiming to do in the future. The as part of that, a big element is that a very, very large contingent of people from business, the oil and gas business, but business turned up. And I think that's a great thing because nearly everything we're talking about is driven by or affected by how people consume things and how things are made. And of course, nearly all this stuff is produced by business. So it was great to see business turn up. And that really means that business is now paying attention and it's not just focused on sort of individual single sectors. The other thing, of course, is it was hosted by the president of the COP, who is also the CEO of Adnok, the state oil company. He's also the CEO of the largest renewables company as well, Mazdar. And that created an environment where there was a greater degree of inclusion of representatives from the oil and gas sector. I can remember Paris. Initially, there was quite a bit of interest in bringing certain oil companies in. And in the end, the politicians told them not to show up at the last minute. And it is all getting rather difficult, whereas this time, much more inclusive. And as we'll find out later, I think it's led to some announcements and initiatives which will make a significant difference as a result of that. Thank you, Brian. David, would you or Arthur have any additional comments on the differences between prior COPs and this one? I know you both are also longtime observers of this particular event and gathering. No, I think Brian's done a good job. So let's I'm happy to move on. That sounds good. So if we could, I know you've talked a little bit about this. I could say a couple of words. OK, if you can hear me, I can say a couple of words about Trey. Can you hear me? Hello, Trey? You're good. OK, OK, good. David, David remembers this. In fact, he's the one who reminded me. We met at COP6 or 6BIS. It was actually, I think, was 6BIS in Bonn, right, David? So so I think it's important. It's important to remember that at COP5, I started at COP5. At COP5, in 1999, there were less than 10,000 people and everyone, all the negotiations could fit into the Hotel Maritime in Bonn. And then I think there were about three German Ministry buildings at the time they were still there in Bonn, three German Ministry buildings that were allowed to host various smaller negotiations. The Hotel Maritime is a very impressive hotel. It has these two huge plenary rooms that are almost styled like a like like a UN kind of a UN kind of a setting, theater, amphitheater kind of setting with many allowing for countries to negotiate. So it was a very impressive hotel. But that's it. That was less than 10,000. And if you think about Green Zone, well, there was no Green Zone back then. The side events were maybe in a conference room. You host one or two meetings. And then what the pavilions or business hubs or any kind of pavilions that you can think of now in the Green Zone or Blue Zone, they were literally just a few folding tables and a couple of chairs where people sit there with literature on the table. Of course, that was back in the day when we still have a lot of hard copies, not too many computers yet with showing a lot of slideshows, but more tables and a few people in the atrium of that hotel. And that was it. That was the Green Zone combined with pavilions and everything. So the enormous scope has changed. And the last number I saw was actually even close to 96,000 as I saw in the registration. So it's a huge difference. And the complexity of the issues are just that much more complex. So thank you. Thank you, Arthur. I think, you know, Brian, you alluded to this a few minutes ago that there were some side agreements and other announcements that were made alongside of COP. Could you elaborate a little bit on that comment? Yes. What were the standouts? I know there's probably many, but maybe pick a few that were the most relevant in your view. OK, so there's some of them were sort of parallel. Some of them ended up being sort of meshed in with the UAE consensus. But the big one really is was the announcement on December the 2nd about the global decarbonization accelerator. And that is a that was a very big it's a big umbrella initiative that was pulled together by the COP 28 team under Dr. Sultan's presidency, which was a mixture of some initiatives which had been brewing for a few months beforehand or maybe a bit longer and also new things. And under this decarbonization accelerator, there were three main elements. So one is about quick, almost like quick wins in a way. So it included things like looking at methane. And underneath that is the new program that is being pulled together by the World Bank to as a successor to the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership. It's now looking at methane reductions as a new fund that's being established to support projects to eliminate methane emissions. And then the second stream is about decarbonizing today's energy system. And that's where probably the two big ones for our industry come in. So the first one is the oil and gas decarbonization charter. And the aim of this particular charter is to was initially or is predominantly to enroll more national oil companies into setting higher levels of climate ambition that perhaps they've done already. Along with other companies as well. So this would include included setting scope one and two net zero ambitions by 2050 aiming for zero methane by 2030 and eliminating routine flaring as sort of three of the ambitions that are under this. And the aim of this particular initiative is to as well as setting the ambition, it's going to provide a bit of a bit of a framework to enable knowledge transfer, good practice transfer to help particularly in the national oil companies who are sort of not normally involved in these programs to learn the processes, technologies and practices that are needed in order to get there. So that's that's particularly big initiative that's that was announced underneath the the GDA. And a number, as I say, I think some 40 percent of the world's oil and gas oil production, I think, has been assigned up to this. Quite a number of national oil companies who haven't participated, particularly in other initiatives have joined that. So that's a good example of an opportunity for the industry to scale up action. The other the other stream is the industrial industrial transition accelerator. And this is looking more on the demand side emissions associated with the demand side and is looking at hard to obey industrial sectors. So steel, cement and aluminum shipping, aviation, power and oil and gas. And the aim of this particular accelerator is to scale up sector delivery of decarbonization activities. And this is and the end the aim is to find help, bring the technology, the engineering, the commercial and the financial institutions to the table. In order to create pathways for industrial sectors to decarbonize. And so those are the sort of the three main things. So there's the oil and gas decarbonization charter, the industrial transition accelerator and then the World Bank methane thing are the things I wanted to bring out in particular. Thank you. Brian, we're recognizing that we have about five minutes left. I might ask for you all to share your perspectives on the on the next steps for the industry in response to COP 28. We've touched a little bit on it, but are there are there any standout next steps that you think are coming? Seems like some of them are wrapped up into these initiatives. But is there anything else you'd like to add? Yes, I'm happy to. So I think. I think what you've seen at COP 28 is the particularly, you know, with it with this language that started off as phasing out fossil fuels, but ended up as a sort of a transition away from fossil fuels is, you know, a very major challenge to the role of oil and gas in the energy system. And I think also a challenge to actually the rest of society who perhaps don't completely see the role of oil and gas in the energy system. And we're sort of like passing ships in the night almost that, you know, oil and gas and coal make up 80 percent of the energy mix. And yet a lot of people talk about this as if it's something we could dispose of, you know, in the very short term. So I think the industry is being challenged. I mean, the whole climate change issue is a challenge to the industry, but it's being challenged. And it's very foundations of existence rather than its ability to manage emissions, which which didn't get enough discussion that I think that's that's perhaps one of the big challenges going forward. That's not to say that we can live in a world where we burn the same amount of oil, gas and coal and manage all the emissions. That's that's not practical. But I think we do live in a world where we're going to use oil, gas and coal to some extent for all of this century on a declining pathway. And so we're going to have to manage emissions on a significant scale. And the room that we're being given as an industry to allow us to do that is diminishing. Part of that is that we're going to have to manage emissions on a significant scale. And that's the problem is diminishing, partly because we haven't scaled up fast enough in the time that we've been talking about technology such as carbon capture and storage. So, yeah, I think you were going to jump in. I do. And I want to build exactly on what David left off. I think the is very important for us as the sector at this sector to really take the signal that's been given to us very clear now. It's very clear to us from the consensus from the parties themselves that we need to focus a lot more on scaling up carbon capture and storage and low carbon hydrogen production. Those are two explicitly stated phrases in the in like paragraph 28. I think go with paragraph 27 in the global stocking. So those are very clear statements now. And the timing is also very urgent. Now, whether the timing and all that could be delivered, that's up to up to a lot of different people as well, not just us in terms of policy. It will also be up to governments themselves, whether each government has the ability to to to enact those policies and be able to have the people as well to to deploy the technologies. All this comes back to my mind of the three things I know the years is anything that really we need to have to have this kind of transformation. We really have to have not only the technology, we have to have climate finance and we have to have people people meaning capacity building people that can deploy the technologies, develop technologies and deploy them. So so really is technology, finance or money and people. And those three things have to go together in order to even scale up anything. And I'm not just talking about energy sector as well at this cop. I paid a little bit of attention to to other sectors and I could see the failure of negotiations in the ag sector. There were agricultural food systems kind of decisions that also failed to achieve agreement at this cop and it has to be made at the next cop. That to now fall into a work program that has to be facilitated and be done in the next three years to reach agreement. So it's not just energy. We're talking about food and food security as well. All of that comes together in major challenges. And in terms of money at top twenty nine Baku money will be a big, big thing. Big headlines next year. Thank you, Arthur. I'd like to ask the panelists if you have some summarizing comments, perhaps you can each share a minute or so of your final comments, starting with Brian. Okay, so, yeah, I think I just want to build on really what David and also have been saying. I think it's particularly what it means for the industry and people who work in the industry. I think that we've got a lot of work to do to broaden and scale up efforts to reduce and minimize emissions, not just within our within the individual our own companies, but to help other companies in the wider industry come along as well. And the real proof point, you know, so, you know, the oil and gas industry had his best shot a cop in terms of trying to position itself as part of the solution in this cop. And we've got to sort of prove we've got to prove that we're worth it. And one of the biggest proof points will be on methane and eliminating methane is something we is something that can be done urgently and have a very big impact. And I really hope that we can we can nail that and scale that up across the across the wider industry. The other thing I think is quite important is I'm getting very concerned that there is a lot of rhetoric about CCS, which is negative coming from the top of the UN and also why you now where they seem to have they seem to be leaving the science behind. So you hear the IPCC talking about CCS. And I think a challenge for the industry is going to be getting the technical fact based messaging around CCS landed with with the state key stakeholders around the world because I'm getting a bit concerned that there are people who are trying to discredit it and claim its unproven technology and all this sort of stuff. And I think that's going to be a hindrance to making progress in any form, particularly with hardware base. Thank you, Brian. David, the only final comments. Yeah, just building on what Brian says, I think he's right. We're losing our license to operate. We're losing our license to operate. And even though we're still supplying this huge percentage of the energy system. So there's a there's a complete contradiction going on. And the CCS is problematic. And I think we've had 20 years to try and land the argument. Really, in the next few years, the only way to land this is actually to build these projects. And that's going to take a lot of resource from the industry. And but if the industry doesn't step up and do it, creating its own business models to do it. I think that the license to operate starts to start to really be challenged. Thank you, David. And finally, with Arthur. Yes, but first, before I forget, let me thank Brian and the whole IPCA platform. It's been a platform for me for many years now, leading the IPCA COP task force. So thank you, Brian, for this, for that privilege. As I said, I've been doing this since COP 5. I've been a member observer for many years. As I eat as well as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. So so to me, over this many years, what I've seen again is those three pillars I mentioned, the three legged stool. You've got to have the people who can deploy the technology to really scale things up. You have the technology itself and then you have to have the have the money to do this. Now, of course, what I forgot to say and I should have said perhaps is behind all of this and underneath all that has to be policy. At the towards the end of my career now here at Chevron, I'm back on the policy team. I started out a lot in policy and now I'm going full circle back to policy. And at the end of the day, it's also government policies. So not all the blame, if you will, can be can be on it would be on us. It's really policies to have to facilitate all this investments and all that give us some some clear signal that we can go big, that we can go big on CCS. And because we don't get that signal, we cannot make those investments. We answer to shareholders as well as you know, we also have to comply with with laws. So regulations, obviously, but we have to answer the shareholders and shareholders don't see investment opportunities. They they want to invest in in our companies. So so it's very important policy has to be done right. And then we have to have to have a kind finance the people. And of course, with that technology that that's necessary to scale up. Thank you for this opportunity. And this will be my last cop. So thanks very much for all the years of this. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you, Brian, David and Arthur for your time today.

SPE Live Podcast: Artificial Intelligence Systems and Drilling,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, leveraging expertise to prepare for the next generation. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on September 9th, 2024. Welcome to this SPE Live on leveraging expertise to prepare the next generation. My name is Bob Merrill and I am the SPE Engineering Professionally Committee Chairman. And I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last about 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Todd Green is the team lead for the Technical Advisory Group at Aramco's Upstream Professional Development Center, where he supervises the development and delivery of all upstream professional development courses. Prior to joining Aramco in 2014, he worked for Halliburton, Baker Hughes, and BJ Services. He graduated from Texas Tech with a BS in Multidisciplinary Science. Now Todd has authored nine SPE papers. He served as the Intervention and Coil Tubing Association Chairman from 2016 to 2018. And he was also Chairman of the 2022 Annual SPE ICODA Conference. Todd, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you. I'm glad to join you today. Tell me, Todd, what is the SPE Certification Preparation Program at Aramco? Yeah, so that's really a great question, and I really appreciate the opportunity to share our experiences. So Aramco wanted a means to prove up how successful we've been at training our professionals. We intake professionals from around the globe. We send them to the top universities here in Aramco and in Saudi Arabia, and then also around the globe. And then they have a series of programs that we put them through for onboarding and training in the first couple of years of their career. And so senior management wanted a way to benchmark really against the industry how well we're doing and what better way to do that than to look to the industry. And we saw the SPE Certification Program. So I believe this journey started even before my time, about 12 years ago. And the center I work at took on this project. So we first started with what I think we're going to get to talking throughout the time. But we started with using a consultant just to see how they would train our people to take the certification exam. As with any certification exam, if it's a real exam, a real certification exam, it shouldn't be easy. But we noticed from the beginning that we needed to put a concerted effort in how we prepared our participants, our candidates, our upstream professionals. So, of course, we follow the SPE guidelines of someone has to be practicing petroleum engineer for four years. So we screen all of our petroleum engineers and we come up with a list and then we send a note to their management offering to put them through a program. And so the program we've developed has ended up has evolved into a nine week program where my team of experts here guide these participants through a program. First, we start with a week long intensive reviewing all the various disciplines and then covering some gaps they may have because of some areas maybe we don't cover. For example, we don't really do rod pumping here in Saudi Arabia. We're starting to utilize it in some areas. But so we realize there's going to be a knowledge gap to some of our professionals that have not been exposed to that topic. So we do have professionals here that work in Aramco that have worked in those fields and those type fields that outside of the kingdom. And so we leverage that knowledge. We gained it. Some of those people have since retired, but we've recorded them and we utilize that material to train those participants. So we normally start the program with a benchmark test. We've taken old test questions and we try to see where their gaps are. Some of the questions we've taken from our curriculum courses that we've created. And then based on the analysis that we do of those questions, then we laser focus in on what gaps that particular cohort has. And then from that standpoint, we give them time to study. So we normally about two to three week window, depending on holidays and work schedule. Then we give them a first practice test and we assess that test and we give them feedback on that. And then we bring them back in for a virtual. Now it's virtual, but a Q&A session with our SMEs, our subject matter experts from from the company within the company. And then we give them another two weeks to study and we give them a second practice test. And then we, if needed, we'll do a second Q&A. But normally after the second practice test, they're ready. And then we follow with the exam. Well, that's that's very interesting because it certainly seems to be successful because the SP statistics indicate that Aramco has the largest pool of SP and certified engineers in the world. So I take it that you at Aramco are seeing real benefits from the SP certification program. Could you elaborate on some of those benefits? Yeah, that's correct. So anything we do in Aramco, we're very proud of. We're proud of our people. We have we have some of the I believe the best people in the world working for us. It's a place people want to work for. And really what we see more than anything is it's a it's a benchmark and one of the key, I guess, data points that we have to prove that we have some of the best people in the kingdom working here for us. So for us, it's not so much that it adds any any more value to their day to day. It's more or less them being able to have now a certification that if they chose to stay with Aramco, they can be proud of. And it proves that they are one of the top in the industry. It also because it's not an easy exam. If anyone's ever looked at it, I've looked at it. I mean, obviously myself. And secondly, if they decided to go work somewhere else, it's going to improve our industry. So one of the things we really thrive on here at Aramco is we're obviously we want our people to be the best and we want them to be trained and we want them to be certified. But we also want to influence the industry as a whole, because we realize that globally, we're obviously a big player in the industry. And if we as professionals aren't represented well to the world, then it affects us all. And so we want to make sure anyone who is on the resume has worked at Aramco can leave here with more than they came with. You know, sometimes it's very, very difficult to actually implement a program that is as focused and as successful as Aramco's SPE certification preparation program. What's our recommendation? Would you give to other NOCs, national oil companies or even IOCs, which wanted to to implement a similar program? How would you make SPE certification sort of a routine expectation of your staff? Yeah, so Bob, that's a really good question. And for the most part, it's about the people we say from UPC, the Upstream Professional Development Center, where I work, that it is about the people. It is about your people. And what we found is we have the most success in our people training our people. And when you're a company as big as we are, I mean, I have just in production engineering alone, 500 engineers. There's some massive amounts of experience in that area. And also, they've been working in our fields for a while and have had global exposure exposure. So really, the full story of our story, try to give it in a short answer, is that it started with senior management. Senior management wanted and knew what we were doing. They were involved in the establishment of our training programs in our building from the beginning. And then they wanted, like I said, a data point and a way to be able to prove what we're doing and how good it is. And so they basically started this initiative. And initially, we started with a vendor and he was a good vendor. And some of you may know him, but he came and did a one week intensive and helped people work through questions they may have. But what we find from a learning perspective is that's probably one of the most inefficient ways to learn. Most of us take more than one week to gather something. So really what it's doing is just proving what you don't know and what you need to study. So we took that knowledge and then we have our in-house engineers. So I have 23 on my staff that are covering various disciplines of upstream from geology, petroleum engineering, reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, production engineering, petrophysics and several others. And we said, OK, right. Here's what we need to know. Here's what's on the exam. What can we put together to help them study? So we have content development specialists, so the instructional designers. And so they work with us to put together a program. And so what I would say from the beginning, the first step to summarize this management has to be involved. They have to say this is important and we're going to put funding and we're going to put resources towards it. Second thing is you recruit your senior professionals from your your own business and you say, look, this is part of giving back. The company's invested in you. Now we're asking you to invest in your people, which is what we do. And then you hire instructional designer or consultants or whatever you want to help you design the material. And you might even have someone in-house that has an act for doing that. And then the last thing is then to implement the program. That's clearly very successful. But I'm sure that Aramco encountered obstacles during this drive to implementation. Perhaps you could share some of those obstacles with us at this point. You know, really, the biggest obstacle probably is getting started. I think with anything we see this even with new things that are coming online. But once senior management in a company like Aramco gives their I guess, say their vote and wanting it done, then it's pretty easy to get people. So I would say in the beginning to the second other major obstacle was just availing people's time. So when you're trying to get your key performers, so we like to we use the term key performer SMEs. So there's subject matter experts who are very knowledgeable in what they do, but they're not very good at like applying that knowledge. So we seek to find people in the company that are known for the people who are known for being a subject matter expert, but also knowing for applying that knowledge to the best and most efficient way. So you want those key performers to be the ones to help you train the next generation. So this is what we look for when we're developing other courses that we teach and then also to teach those courses. So we went to those same key performers and we asked them to avail time to help us with this program. Now, as you could say, one of the biggest obstacles is every time we run a cohort, we're asking those SMEs to come in for a week and give us each day there's different SMEs. But let's say, for example, you're asking these key performers who are relied on heavily in the business line to give you a day's worth of of their time. Well, that's a lot of times hard to get. So when I took over the program myself, it's right about the time COVID happened. And I was thinking to myself, why don't we record these SMEs? I mean, I'm mid career. I'm getting towards like career now. But even myself, I recorded myself answering questions that I get asked all the time about my specialty. That way I can just refer somebody to that question and not have to answer that question over and over and over. So I put a probe. I mean, basically, with my colleagues, I pitched it to management and said, why don't we create something virtually? So to overcome that hurdle of availing people's time. Well, then, as you know, happened, COVID, you know, the pandemic happened and we realized a lot of us created new things from that. I mean, yes, it was a hard thing, but we couldn't stop doing our training. So we ended up building an ad hoc studio here in our building and we recorded these SMEs and the SMEs were obviously wanting to do something rather than just sit at home. So during that time, we recorded over 94 videos and probably, I would say, about 100 hours of information of our key SMEs. And now we utilize that on a college platform. I mean, some college universities use this. We utilize it on a platform called Blackboard. And so now we can run more participants through. We don't have to occupy the building with that and they can work at their own pace. And so this is the evolution of our program. Fantastic. It sounds like it was thought and it was very comprehensive from the beginning and well thought out. But given, you know, all of the efforts that you put in, is there something that ARAPCO might have done differently in implementation? You know, it's always hindsight's always 22, isn't it? 2020, isn't it? So I think looking back and seeing now the success, we were successful with the program from the beginning. I mean, we were limited on how many individuals we could put through the certification. So if I look back to statistically the numbers, even before I took it on, I think we were averaging maybe certifying 50 a year. And I mean, as you mentioned, we have over 1200 now. Actually, I think we surpassed or about to hit 1400. So because of taking the program online and allowing them and allowing our professionals to have access from multiple areas, because now when it's online, they can access it from the rig, from work locations, when they're just witnessing a job or even in their office, and they can work their own pace. We're now this year, we expect to certify if they all pass, which normally they do, we have 90, like 98 percent pass rate. We expect to service certify over 180 of our engineers this year alone. So each year we've increased that number. When I first took the program on, I think we certified 120. So each year it's driving more and more. So our only limiting factor is the number of books that they need to study, because obviously the petroleum engineering series of books that SBE puts out is also important. We do have a collection of those. We've bought sets of those books and we have a library here in our center and our participants can check those books out. So the only reason we haven't gotten more than 180 individuals this year is we do three cohorts and each cohort we are limited to 90 people based on books. And at some point we'll probably get some more books and do more. But right now that seems to be we've met the demand of our business line. So as the business line is sending more candidates, we will add more resources. Fantastic. You know, that sounds very comprehensive. Now we've discussed the importance of training for all of this. How does the SBE certification program impact other aspects of training at Aramco? So, you know, we're kind of looking at talking to think looking at some of these questions, talking about it, that not to sound, how would you say, not to brag too much on Aramco, but really we never looked at the SBE certification as a means of training. And from an educational standpoint, you have two ways to approach things. You can have a test and you can teach people to pass a test or you can teach people to be experts in what they're going to do and then you can give them a test to prove that they are experts. So we choose option two. So our curriculum is not based on what SBE has in their exam. So our curriculum is based on what we know our petroleum engineers need to do to execute their jobs effectively. And we do the same for our geologists and the same for our data managers and data scientists. And there's a lot of thought and effort that goes into those programs and how we create them. And then what we look for as a company is then, OK, well, we've done these things. We see our we see our participants, we get feedback from our business leaders and their supervisors saying, yes, this participant is doing what they need to do on the job after receiving the training. But we want another external data point. So one of those external data points is a third party system called Metrics That Matter that we do surveys after every course and they give us feedback. And currently we were ranked in the top 10 percent of all global universities in the world. And but even more is an industry respected data point. And that industry respected data point is the SP certification. And so our our my colleagues, our petroleum engineers, they can complete our curriculum and then they can take the SP certification exam and then they can hold that as a certificate and maintain that as a leader in the industry. Very, very interesting, very interesting. That's great to know. I'm going to change topics a little bit here about the future of the SP certification exam, because it's important to engineers to keep moving forward with technology. And one of the areas that has become very important recently and has been a major topic of discussion in universities is the role that data analytics and and forward looking computer science, machine learning, things of that nature. And and also sustainability in the broadest sense on petroleum engineering and petroleum engineering careers. Where do you see the role of analytics, machine learning and or sustainability in an SP certification process? So so we've actually been going through quite a of our own internal research and analysis on what we need to do to future fit our upstream professionals. You might say even revamping our strategy here at the upstream professional development center. And a big part of that is what are we doing with data? And now what are we doing with sustainability efforts? So I'll comment on each of them a little bit separately and based on some of the learning I've had, because I'm a production engineer and specifically I'm a well intervention specialist. And so I know that area really well. But if you ask me about data science applications, data analytics, machine learning, IR four point all these terms that are thrown around, what we came to realize is that even at the university level and publications, the industry still grappling on what what do you call it and what is it actually and how do you use it? So we did a proper analysis of that and we have actually launched a data science job family or discipline at our training center. And we have our first cohorts going through data science curricula. And the reason I say data science is because data science is a more broad term that incorporates machine learning data analytics, different programming softwares that you utilize to do these things. So to me, it's very analogous to the fact like when PCs came out, we all had to learn how to use personal computers and what can they do for us? And what we're seeing is are all the different advancements in these tools that are used within the data science realm. How do they affect and apply to what we do in the operation? Now, as far as knowledge of how you would test it in S.P.E., I'm not so sure that that's something that needs to be on the S.P.E. exam because we're still engineers. And that's what we're testing is our engineering knowledge. Our core business does not change. It's just that we're getting new tools to do that core business. Then when you look at sustainability, we're recently that we've been going through this process to see what sustainability trainings do our people need to know. Well, sustainability is a massive word. It's a very broad topic. You could talk about sustainability workforce. You could talk about sustainable energy. You can talk about sustainable environment. It is so broad that it's hard to nail down. So what we begin to realize is that really what's more important is what our industry is focused on, at least us, we're looking at is what are you doing with carbon? What's your carbon footprint and how do you reduce that? And then how whatever you are producing, how do you become carbon neutral? And so essentially what we're doing is upskilling our professionals to look at what we do and how can we take these techniques? For example, we extract hydrocarbons from the reservoir. Now we're looking at how do we put carbon dioxide back into the reservoir? And so that's a different topic, but similar. So is that sustainability? Maybe, but really we're taking our what we already know about the reservoir and what we reservoir engineering techniques and completions and drilling. And we're applying it to do things in reverse to mitigate an offset. What happens when you're exploring hydrocarbons? So I guess my answer would be that I don't know that it's fit for S.P.E. I will say as part of our data science curricula, we're pursuing right now a company that has a data science certification. We also have a data management job family discipline. So we have data managers in the company and there's a nationally recognized in the kingdom and globally group called DAMA. And we've actually certified now 28 professionals in that and DAMA certification. So I think those two topics are they complement what we do, but they're standalone. I don't know that S.P.E. needs to take it on. Well, that's very interesting because there is, as I said, there's a lot of discussion in academia about the whether they should we should be taking that on or not. You know, you mentioned earlier about the need to enlist managements. First, let me remind people, please, if you have any questions for Todd, please write them in the chat and we'll ask Todd the questions, but we will have some time for questions. So you mentioned earlier about the need to have management engagement and fully fully committed in order to get access to your S.M.E.s to provide training and recordings and input for your program. But I imagine there's a difference between having your boss tell you to do something and actually getting your your S.M.E.s fully engaged behind the program. Is there anything that you needed to do in your program to enlist the wholehearted support of the S.M.E. community? You know, Aramco is a unique environment, and I can say that one of the key things for us is how our center, our training center, the Upstream Professional Development Center was set up in the first place. And it was set up from sponsored by upstream president. And we were separate where organizationally we are part of upstream, but we're standalone and we don't report to any one department for per se. But we serve all the departments within upstream and giving them training. And so we also have provided value by upskilling and increasing the time to competency of our participants. So, for example, our value add to the business line from the beginning is say, let's take a fresh graduate from X University, whatever university. And although these universities are phenomenal, they're not giving them hands on experience. And there's no book or no professor that's going to be able to train somebody on how to deal with some of the things we deal with on the job. And this is any career, not just this is why medical people go to have interns. You know, they go to medical residency. So it's no different. Well, statistically, it takes between seven to ten years for a professional to become independently contributing. In other words, they're not having to go to the supervisor to get input. So our goal from the beginning was to take these key performers and take their knowledge and to get our young professionals to where they are able to contribute independently within three to four years. And we've proved that over the years. So then adding on to that based on feedback from the line and seeing their performance and adding on to that when you bring in a certification program to complement that, it just fits right in place. So for us, it started with having things put in place. The second thing I would say is recognizing your SMEs. Now, there's two. We always have this debate, to be honest, in the industry. And then also our company is no different than others is what's in it for me. Well, most of us, I think by the time we start getting to my age and further, it has to be more about than just the money or just the career. I mean, you know, if you're successful and you've and you've made I mean, you've done well for yourself, then what can you do to make the world better? And I think we have a culture here in Aramco that we look to say, what can we do to help each other and help make the world better? And part of that's giving back. And I think other companies have similar stances. So if you're willing to give back, it's a lot more fulfilling. And this is what our SMEs find if you can convince them, which we do. Once they invest in a young professional and they see the fruits of that investment, it's contagious. And you want to do it for others. And so I think that's the other intangible that has to be woven into the DNA of the company. And it's something I'm proud to say that I feel like we have in Aramco, at least where I've seen. And and me as a professional, I owe a lot to Aramco and how they've trained me. And I'm just giving back. Great. Great. It's very important to give back, I think, in every aspect of your career, every part of your career. We have a question to ask for you from the audience. Todd, are you leveraging the domain knowledge edge that service providers bring around technology and expertise to improve training at Aramco? Absolutely. First of all, I want to say hello to Luis and thanks for joining. We're colleagues from way back. So, yeah, we do leverage the service companies. So specifically, there are some technologies that we've adapted that are everyday use by the service providers, whether it be Schlumberger Halliburton Baker or you name it, even some other smaller companies. And there's also I mean, I was trained and brought up as an intervention specialist by the service companies in which one of the courses I teach is training our I just taught one last week, actually, is training our professionals how to interpret the information they're getting from a service company proposal on on various disciplines. Because so this is very key. We have we have long standing relationship with our with our vendors, with our service companies. And many times our service companies have some SMEs that are our partners, valued partners with us. They come in and teach these courses or some of them. Most 80 percent of our courses are taught by our people. But even some of our people used to work for some of those companies. And then I would say 20 percent we rely on proprietary information. So, for example, if there's a software by Baker Hughes that we're utilizing and then we need Baker Hughes to come help us teach that software, we're not going to try to teach Baker Hughes proprietary software as an example. Thank you very much. We've approached that. Excuse me. We are approaching the end of our session. So I really want to thank you, Todd, for joining us today on SBE live. And I want to thank the audience for joining us as well and for the question we received. So we hope to see you all next time on SBE live. Thank you. Thank you so much, Todd.

SPE Live Podcast: Chemical Considerations of CCUS and New Energy Development,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the March 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast with Terry Palish, creating our energy future, maximizing your membership by leveraging SPE's multimedia content. And now your moderator, SPE Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Dana Otilio. Hello, I'm Dana Otilio, Vice President of Marketing and Communications at SPE. I'm pleased to join 2024 President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast episode. This month, Terry will continue to share the ways members can leverage SPE's published content to enhance their technical expertise. Terry, thank you for inviting me to join you on this topic. Well, Dana, thank you for joining me. And I thought, you know, what better person to discuss our multimedia than you. So that's why I thought you'd be a great one. So, you know, as you know, we're about halfway through the series now, this podcast series in my columns. And, you know, the whole goal of which was to help our members understand how to get the most out of their SPE membership. You know, I like to use the analogy of the gym membership. And I want to make sure that our members understand all the offerings and so that they can help create their own energy future. So far, we've, of course, covered the regional sections. We've covered technical sections, SP Connect. Last month, of course, we covered print media. So I thought it might be good to cover multimedia this month with you. So hopefully we can get through talking about SPE's energy stream, maybe webinars and training, SP live and maybe even work in a few thoughts on the Distinguished Lecture Program and PetroWiki. You know, I think multimedia is now kind of the future. And the content helps us run really the full gamut of our mission. It's not just connecting our members to technology, but it also includes members to members. But probably this is the one that probably helps us connect to our external stakeholders as much as anything, because we have a lot of external stakeholders that tune into our SP live and some of the other things. Yeah, that's very true. So let's start by taking a look back at how we got here with SPE's multimedia content. Can you share a bit about what led SPE to start creating more video and audio content? You know, SPE has offered webinars and online training courses, you know, for many years. I think we started probably in 2013. But this content was all kind of standalone, not necessarily, you know, kind of combined and relate to each other and certainly was not as well utilized as our SP events. So prior to the pandemic, as you know, SPE was looking for ways to, you know, kind of best capture some of the best of moments of our presentations at our events. But in many ways at that time, the AV technologies just really hadn't caught up. So one of the one of the very small benefits that came out of the pandemic was quick advancements in AV technologies because we all got thrust into that situation. So it was really during the pandemic is when SP live was born. Excellent. So can you share with our listeners what SP live is and what kind of response we got from members? Yeah, so of course, we all remember what happened in April 2020. And SP, to their credit, you and your team adapted very quickly to the strain that the COVID was putting on SPE and our members. You know, we couldn't meet for our events. We couldn't meet at our section meetings. We couldn't get together. And it was a huge issue for us in helping our members connect with each other. So SP launched the SP live series on LinkedIn. The ironic thing is, I believe LinkedIn had reached out to SP just before that and asked if they wanted to be part of a beta test on something they were going to call LinkedIn live. And we didn't we didn't do that because of the pandemic, but it was already at the forefront of our mind. So we were able to quickly adapt and put on our own. So, you know, the board was very supportive and still is. I know we were scrambling to try to find speakers and I think board members and people stepped up and significant members in the in our membership helped. But, you know, today the platform's kind of evolved. The goal of SP live is now to provide timely content. But then, you know, content that's, you know, on interesting, probably hot topics of the day, but in really a more of a conversational tone. So it's almost like a live podcast. So, you know, of course, we're looking for global topics, topics that are important to all of our membership, talking about thought leadership, high level. They're also not huge production, so they can be a quick turnaround. Of course, the purpose called SP live. So the purpose is to be live. But so we do try to respond to questions and comments by viewers, but it's also available on demand. And again, this is one of our multimedia outlets that is available to both members and non members. So we have the ability to reach those that aren't in our membership as well. As far as popularity, I will say this due to popularity, we can we started something this last year called tech talks. And this is where we have the same conversational setting. But we allow companies or sponsors to provide sponsored content so they can have a conversational discussion about their products. Or service or topic. And these have been very popular. I think I think we're now doing like eight to 10 of these per month. We do like four to five SP lives month. And I think we're getting 16 to 1700 views between the online and demand. So it's really one of our growing outlets of multimedia. And then, of course, I just want to put a plug in one of the last one of the most recent successes is kind of taking our DL's and featuring a DL. In the current season each month. So it allows them to get their message out in their presentation out in another outlet. That's great. I mean, sometimes when I'm listening to an SP live, I think about someone, you know, in some far off country, because we have people that are watching the show, you know, at all times of the day and night. You know, someone eating popcorn on their couch, you know, before they go to bed listening to an SP live. I mean, that's that's kind of some of the response we've gotten globally on those broadcasts, which is pretty cool. So you mentioned how SP live and the tech talks are available on demand. Where can members find all this content? Yeah. So as SP, of course, expanded outside of just providing print media and we started creating all this multimedia videos, webinars, so on. It was, as you know, kind of located in different places. And so in twenty twenty two SP launched the Energy Stream, the Energy Stream website. And so the idea is that that website you can go to see all of our multimedia content all in one place. And so we continue to improve that. So I like to think of the Energy Stream as kind of the one petro of multimedia. So one petro is where we go to a lot of our print and energy streams where we can get our multimedia. It's accessible from the SP dot org homepage or you can go right to streaming dot SP dot org. Of course, when you get there, the system has links for webinars, for online training, for the SP lives and of course, our podcast. So if you're listening to this podcast, you can that's how you can access all my past podcasts. So and of course, we continue to improve it. We added the learning management system this past year. So that allows us to kind of combine this continuing education credits and allows you to go to one place to kind of see where you're at, what you've done for training. So it's kind of a one stop shop for that as well. So let's go back to something you mentioned earlier about the Distinguished Lecture Program. I think most of our members know that these selected experts visit sections around the world in person. How do these fit in with SPE live? Yes, let's maybe take a step back. You know, the DL program, Distinguished Lecture Program is really one of SPE's most probably popular and prestigious programs. It's a very rigorous process. It's a subject matter expert. And it's really it's very important to SPE. It's so important that it's actually partially underwritten by the SPE Foundation. The primary benefit of the Distinguished Lectures from a membership standpoint is, like you said, for them to visit the sections in person. For some sections, this may be the only times that they meet. So it's very important to the sections. It's very rigorous. Like I said, we select about 30 to 35 each year. I think we try to get two or three from each discipline. And these are subject matter experts in their topic. A lot of times it might start from an SP paper or a presentation that they gave. It is important to our sections. Each section gets two Distinguished Lecturers each year that's provided at no cost to the section. So it allows them a chance to meet, bring their section and members together. And like I said, for some, that may be the only time they meet. It's rigorous on the speakers as well. They have to travel the world. But one of the things we did this past year, like you were mentioning, was we added now an SP live feature as well. So in addition to making your travels and getting the benefits of being there in sections, we now have the ability to broadcast that live once a month. So that gives both the presenters another opportunity to get their message out, but it also gives the SP sections another opportunity to view a speaker. And I will say this is one of the, while SP lives are free to anyone in or outside of SP, the DL lives are not. That's a member benefit. So it's important to understand you have to be a member to see those. Yeah. And I would think too for the sections, since you mentioned they only get two of those visits per year, it gives those sections a chance to maybe hear other presenters too. Exactly. You didn't have a chance to hear in person. So that's great. It's great that it's been able to provide that value. So you've talked a good bit about SP live, how it provides a timely overview and conversation around a topic. What are SP webinars and how are they different? Okay. Well, first of all, an SP live is typically, I think we don't want to go over 30 minutes. So it's typically targeting a little bit less than that. A webinar is typically going to be 60 to 90 minutes. So a webinar is more of a, I'll call it a technical presentation. So it's not a conversational setting. It's a presenter speaking, probably has a PowerPoint going. So it's kind of more of a live technical presentation. Of course, webinars going to dive deeper into a technical topic, whereas the SP live is more conversational like we're having here. Webinars are also live. A lot of people view them live. They have the ability to have Q&A, but then they are also offered on demand. So all the webinars are on the energy stream. They have past webinars, so you can view those on demand as well. Again, member benefit webinars are free. So you can view any past webinar for no charge. If you're a non-member, there is a slight fee for that. And then lastly, webinars are then you have the ability to now earn continuing education credits for a webinar as well. So an SP live doesn't do that. It's not what its intent is, but a webinar, of course, is an education. So we have that ability. So I kind of like to think of webinars are to technical sections what DLs are to regional sections. So it's the ability for the technical sections to get some technical knowledge out to their global audience. Excellent. So SP lives, short conversational SP webinars, more of a technical presentation, lots of Q&A. So how do the online training courses, how do those fit in with these other two products? Yeah, online training is done kind of in a couple of different ways. But think of an online training as more of a course or a class. So a training class is going to be typically at least a day, probably multi-day, and it's not necessarily even broken up in days. It's just time. So it's always basically available on demand. So you can watch it at your own pace, pause it, come back to it. There's also typically tests and quizzes along the way to kind of help reinforce whether you're getting the material, things like that. And then, of course, as you would expect, you get continuing education credits as well. As I said, there's really two sources of that. SP puts on about 15 online training, has made about 15 online training courses with SP members as the subject matter experts. And they're really more specific to certain topics. But we also in 2019 partnered with IHRDC to basically link their technical content or excuse me, their training content to our members. And so if there's a discussion or a training you need and it's offered through IHRDC, you go through our website and you can get a reduced rate for our members. So that's kind of how we try to meet the all in training needs of our members and work in our wheelhouse, but also take advantage of expertise and others. So I want to say one more thing. There's also in-person training. That's not what I'm talking about here today, but we do provide in-person training. That's usually run alongside of an event. So that's only a live event. And so those are unique to a specific event or workshop or so on. So you've covered a lot of different content that's available on the Energy Stream website. You know, we know that our members can get content, technical content, and lots of different shapes or forms. So as an extension of Energy Stream, can you tell the audience a bit about PetroWiki? Yeah, PetroWiki, you know, a lot of some of our members may remember the petroleum engineering handbook. It's something that was developed many years ago, and it was really meant to be the reference manual for petroleum engineers. It was actually last updated in 2007, and at about that time was when Wikipedia started becoming very popular. And so it was thought, well, why don't we make this more of a living document and not necessarily a living document, but a living idea? And so we developed PetroWiki. And so PetroWiki is meant to work like Wikipedia, where members can update and add content at their will. And then, of course, there can be debate and, you know, that type of work. But again, it works just like Wikipedia. PetroWiki gets a lot of traffic. There's a lot of people who access it. The one unfortunate thing is we just really haven't had a lot of updating going on, not as much as we'd like. And we've been working on how do we make that happen. And so we're looking for ways to improve that. I think it's a powerful resource for our members. Like I said, a lot of members view it. A lot of our younger members and even students use PetroWiki as a reference. Of course, then the other question is we have things like ChatGPT and some of the AI stuff coming in. And so then the question is maybe there's, you know, do we combine those two? Is there kind of a way to leverage one or the other? So, you know, I think that's kind of where we're at now and trying to understand the place for PetroWiki. But it's a powerful resource. You know, I would encourage if you have some things to add to that to please do, because we can always use updated content. Yeah, absolutely. And we know PetroWiki has a lot of content in there that could be leveraged. You know, we've got ChatGPT, as you say, you know, has entered the world and has really changed the world very radically in its very short time in existence. So since we're talking about AI and ChatGPT, what do you think is the future of AI as it's related to SPE? Yeah, I just want to remind everyone of one thing. Remember, in PetroWiki, everything is sourced, so, you know, or cited. So unlike ChatGPT, where you have no idea where the source came from, at least you know where that source came from. But look, many people probably don't realize it, but AI has been employed by SPE for many years. It's really the backbone of how we've been able to take our technical content, our print content and things like that, and make it searchable in our research portal. So if you go onto one Petro and use the research portal, it's using AI to find keywords and define the articles that you need. So SPE has been looking at AI for a while, but we're also now, of course, starting to look at other ideas, particularly with the advent of large language models. You know, right now, I will remind everybody that large language models like ChatGPT, whatever, can only access free content. So everything behind our paywall, which would include one Petro, is not in ChatGPT or available. So, you know, I think there's some opportunities for us. I can tell you that we are currently working and looking at, you know, how does SPE leverage large language models? How do we incorporate one Petro? We've had many companies approach us with trying to collaborate. So times are changing really fast in this, and we're still continuing to get our arms around it. But I think there's a lot of opportunity. And our goal is to use AI to help our members. So whatever we do will be to do that. Wonderful. So we're just about out of time. Thank you so much for today's discussion. This is really things that are near and dear to my heart. So how do members use what we talked about today to get the most out of their SPE membership? Yeah. So obviously, that's my most important point is I want to make sure our members understand how they use it. The first thing I would recommend is if you haven't been to it, go to the Energy Stream website, explore the site, see what's available, you know, explore the webinars, look at the SPE lives, you know, be on the lookout for SPE lives that are of interest to you. I would follow SPE on LinkedIn if you don't already, because then you'll be able to get the immediate links for that. I would also, though, make sure you, you know, kind of think about what are areas of education or technical training that you need. And first step might be to search the webinar library. There's a there's a ton of webinars in there and they're all sorted by technical discipline. And you can go in and look at what you need. And those are free. I would shoot. I would even recommend maybe make a goal of watch a webinar each month, pick one. Maybe it's in your discipline. Maybe it's something you hadn't don't know that much about and you want to explore it. So that'll help advance your professional development. Of course, whatever section you're in, be on the lookout for the DLs when they come to town. I go to as many of them as I can here in the Dallas section. And then look, if you're a seasoned professional, I just ask that you do a couple of things. One is maybe go into the Petro Wiki site and see if there's some content that you can add or update. But also, don't forget, you can be on SP Live or you can be on do a webinar or be a DL. Speaking of which, by the way, the deal application is ends here in a couple of weeks, March 15th. So if you want to be a DL in next season, now is the time to do that. So, again, I think it's a matter of going onto that site and looking and how do you invest in yourself? How do you invest in your professional career and ultimately create your energy future? Well, it was really great speaking with you today, Terry. Can you give us a sneak peek into what you'll be covering next month? Sure, Dana. First of all, thank you for joining me. I always enjoy visiting with you and my congratulations to you and your team for everything you do and you adapt. And I know this is quickly changing technology. So I know I appreciate it. I'm sure the members do, too. As far as next month goes, I think we're going to try to dive into, you know, how does you know, answering one of the questions I get a lot is how does SP help us improve us as an industry, improve our public image? And so we'll talk about things like the Energy for Me program and some related topics. But I hope that these podcasts are helpful to everybody. Again, encourage you to get the most out of your SP membership, just like you do your health club membership and ultimately create your energy future. Thank you. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the SPE Presidents podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org. Thank you."
"SPE Live Podcast: Well Intervention: Industry Trends, Innovations, and Technologies Support","Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Fostering Future Leaders, the Impact of Mentorship on Women in Leadership. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on March 25th, 2024. And now your moderator, Meral Taufiq. Welcome to this SPE Live, Fostering Future Leaders, the Impact of Mentorship on Women in Leadership. My name is Meral Taufiq and I'm a lead reservoir engineer at Chevron. I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guests, Selena Hioja, who is a diversity and inclusion professional specialized in gender diversity. Her consulting firm, Seli Hioja, advises and works hand in hand with organizations in the process of cultural change involving a diversity and inclusion perspective. She has worked for 15 years in energy companies and in the National Ministry of Energy and Mining. Selena is a mentor and champion of vital voices in the Nukon province, an international NGO that fosters the social, political and economic empowerment of women. Selena has a degree in human resources, is a certified business coach and has also postgraduate degrees in strategic organizational communication, diversity and gender. Emily Firth is the Europe market and business analyst at Halliburton and is passionate about staff development and mentoring. As global mentoring chair for Halliburton's Women Chairing Excellence Employee Resource Group, Emily advocates for the importance of mentoring, technical and soft skill enhancement and matches mentee and mentor pairings globally to increase learning opportunities for staff. With a master's degree in geology and experience as a frontline leader, Emily is versed in motivating technical talent to consider their personal strengths and aspirations and align personal growth with organizational needs. Selena and Emily, welcome to this SPE Live. Thanks for having us today. Thank you. First, I would like to start off with you Selena. Can you share your thoughts about why it is important to promote inclusion and foster women leadership? Yes, of course. Good morning, Miral. While promoting inclusion and diversity have become a must in the business world because it is a request from society, from employees, from investors, stakeholders in general. Also, this agenda is a fundamental part of the ESG agenda and mostly nobody is challenging anymore the value added by having a diversity and inclusion culture, which benefits go from fostering innovation and creativity, improving employee engagement and retention, helping to attract top talent and to delivering better business results. Also, there are several papers that evidence that companies that have women in leadership positions perform better than those which don't. Great. How about you, Emily? Through your work with Helbert and how do you witness any measurable positive effects of targeted women mentorship? Yes. So I wonder if people have heard of the dream gap. So it's the gap that comes between girls and their full potential. So from age five, girls stop believing that they can be scientists, engineers and CEOs. And from age seven, girls are more likely to believe that boys are smarter, three times less likely to be given a science related toy. And parents are twice as likely to Google, is my son gifted rather than is my daughter gifted? And that's a sad state of affair. We need to see brilliant women being brilliant and see how they got to where they are so we can imagine ourselves doing what they do. And that can't happen alone. It requires the support of each other, our mentors, our managers and company leadership. It is up to all of us to close that dream gap. So that example is specific to children. But all the you know, the experience that has shaped the understanding of many professional women navigating career ladders today will be the same. Representation and seeing yourself really matters. And in April last year, Bloomberg announced that the number of women CEOs finally outnumbered the male ones specifically called John. So progress is being made, but we still have a long way to go. So at Halliburton, inclusion is part of our culture and our corporate strategy to attract diverse talent. Diversity and inclusion fosters creativity, innovation and diversity of thought. And studies that Selena alluded to really show us that diversity can help your team become more agile and better equipped to pivot and adapt as necessary to real life. And you asked about measurable effects there. Companies with representation of women exceeding 30 percent and thus in the top quartile are significantly more likely to financially outperform those with 30 percent or fewer. So beyond being the right thing to do, there are strategic reasons to support diversity and inclusion. Very interesting. Yes. And Selena, in our efforts to tailor those mentorship programs to women, what unique things do you see in women's leadership? What unique challenges do women face in our industry and how can those mentoring programs address those challenges? OK, well, women in the workplace in general face different challenges than men. And these challenges are the well-known glass ceiling, the unconscious biases, the maternity tax, the gender pay gap. And we are more prone to be victims or to suffer situationals of harassment or discrimination. In fact, there is a study that shows that in male dominated industry, such as energy, women are more likely to suffer this kind of abuse or situations. So mentoring programs can help to reduce the impact of this barrier as long as they acknowledge they exist. And also, it's very important to mention that most of the time, women, we go through all these situations alone and maybe thinking that we are the problem. We have a problem when actually systemic or structural issue. So through mentoring programs, we can support each other and foster a support network to overcome these barriers. Yeah. And Emily, through your experience with the WISE program at Halbert, do you have anything to add to those challenges? So we still see that the oil and gas industry remains a very male dominated space, and particularly when we consider our field based roles and leadership roles. So to create a more inclusive workplace, companies must consider the needs of pregnant women, women with families and women who serve as primary caregivers. So work environments need to be adapted for pregnant women and companies that offer sort of childcare benefits and services and benefits that benefit all employees. So there are initiatives and mentoring programs that can help to the companies address these sort of gender gaps and to sort of demonstrate how some of these challenges are still present. I wanted to share an example from a 2012 study completed by Moss Raskusen et al. where they sent identical applications to multiple institutions to have them assess the talent. So the only difference between these applications was the name on the applicant. Some of them were submitted underneath the name John and some of them were submitted underneath the name Jennifer. And so that allowed the reviewers to sort of only assess them being different for the gender. So the feedback showed that the likelihood of hiring the candidate was 18% lower when the applicant had a female name. And institutions were 12% less likely to mentor that female and wanted to offer them 13% less with regards to the salary compared to that male counterpart. And remember that all of the education, the experience and the skills mentioned on these CVs were completely the same. Only that name varied. So we still see that biases continue to play out in our workplaces with women being called upon to perhaps take notes during meetings or asked to organize events or purchase gifts for colleagues. And I personally know women who don't take pens to meetings anymore to avoid being asked to be the note taker. So we see that mentoring really helps to address some of these challenges and those biases through support. So employees know that they're not alone in the challenges that they face and they learn how others have navigated perhaps, you know, returning to work or as a new mother managing that sort of work life balance with family. And that's really important, particularly for those field based employees. Yeah, very, very eye opening study there. I think one important aspect here when creating those programs is to first understand what the key skills and competencies that the mentorship program should focus on to help women advance in those leadership roles. So Emily, what key skills do you think are most important in this context? So first and foremost, I would recommend play to your strengths. Women possess a wide range of professional and leadership skills that are highly desirable to companies. So this is slightly sort of stereotyping here partially. I hope you'll forgive me, but there are some sort of main examples that I would like to pull out that we see are quite typical within women sort of talent. First and foremost, it's understanding your audience and being able to communicate with them effectively. We also see a lot of examples from women where they are very natural in leading by example, and this is sort of embodying the attributes that you want to see in others. We often see as well that managing people and behavior and you know part of this ties into emotional intelligence, empathy, integrity, and doing all of that in a sort of inspirational and collaborative way. And partly also being strategic and flexible about long term and short term goals and adjusting those as necessary. So it's hearing the updated sort of project plans or the new information that has come in and seeing how the impact of that will have immediate effects, but also for your longer term planning and being able to adjust that accordingly to the needs of both time periods. And lastly here, I think one thing that we see really strongly within our talent and we want to further that sort of particularly in leadership roles is the ability to listen and respond. And that's not just listening to respond, but really being thoughtful about the response or taking in the situation and being able to have the discussion appropriate to that particular topic. So we build our mentoring programs to enable these and other skills and competencies. So we select mentors of a high caliber that are able to sort of impress the importance of sharing their experiences and their career journeys and what they learned along the way, and help their mentees to uncover their strengths and perhaps identify what areas that they need to make further improvements to. And we do this through, you know, providing resources. I always find that personality and skill assessments are really useful for uncovering these if you haven't really considered what your strengths are first. And then our mentorship sort of helps provide support for that as they continue through that journey to sort of strengthen on those skills. Great. How about you, Suina? Anything to add to this? Yes, I absolutely agree with what Emily said. And just to add some information in general, when we talk about leadership or development programs, we speak of two main aspects. Number one, self-knowledge and number two, relational skills. And if we talk about specific skills, women, we have a space to improve in negotiation, public speaking, building and managing influential professional networks. Great. So now we talked about the challenges and we talked about how to create those programs to best serve women. I guess, Suina, can you also share examples of mentorship success stories where women have progressed to significant leadership positions in our industry? Yeah, well, there are many examples of the positive impact of these mentoring programs. And I would like to mention that mentoring programs brings benefits from mentees, from mentors and for the whole organization as well. One example that comes to my mind in which a person was able to be seen by managers, senior managers from other departments, and she was offered a promotion in a position she was willing to be. Or other instances in which through the stories and experiences shared by the mentor, the mentee was able to see things from other perspectives and come up with some new ideas that she shouldn't have thought about before. Great. How about you, Emily? Any specific examples of success stories you would like to mention? So one case that stands out to me is when we launched one of our product service lines within the Europe area. So we did not initially have any operations there. So we were starting from the ground up with hiring, securing the facilities, everything that we would need. So at that time, no one on that team spoke German, and that was a requirement for this. So coincidentally, the VP of the product service line that was trying to set this up was paired with a female candidate on our leadership career path, who mentioned just in passing that she was from Germany and was fluent in the language during one of their mentoring sessions. So from that, the VP asked if she would like to work at the new facility. And that conversation helped her advance into a leadership role. So in a matter of months, she completed the country manager boot camp and started her new role in Europe. So, you know, prime example of just how that wouldn't have happened had they not been in that pairing relationship together. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So, Emily, based on your work in the WISE program, are there any best practices or lessons learned from implementing this mentoring program that our audience can apply to their own mentoring programs? Yes. So the mentoring program that I'm currently involved in has been running for more than 20 years. So we have a lot of experience with managing those sort of mentorship journeys. And one of the most common hurdles we see and why people may not think that a mentorship program is successful is because they haven't considered what they want to get from it. And, you know, you really do have to set yourself up for success. So identify and choose the skills that you want to be developed. So a couple of things that you can think about to sort of help you get your mind in gear for that. What skills do I need to achieve my objectives? What is my current level of mastery in these skills? And how do I develop them? And we encourage all of our mentees to focus on SMART objectives. And SMART there is an acronym standing for S being specific. So in this, we try and answer the sort of five W questions. So what do I want to accomplish? Why is this call important? Who is involved? Where is it located? And which resources or limits are involved in that? For M, we move to measurable. So a measurable goal should address questions such as how much, how many and how will I know when it's accomplished? And that's really important because we need to make sure that our mentor and pairings have a sense of achievement through this program and feel like they're getting something. And that's very hard to do if you don't know what you're aiming for or when you can consider it completed. So A in SMART is for achievable. So it needs to be realistic and attainable. We want it to stretch your goals, but we want it to remain within the realms of possibility. For R, we want it to be relevant. So this is ensuring that that goal matters to you and aligns with the other goals you're trying to achieve. So, you know, is it worthwhile? Is it the right time? And does it match our other efforts? And again, part of that is just to ensure that you are setting yourself up for success. We don't want to dissuade you from taking on a sort of extra sort of tangent goals or skills, but you will have much more success if you can tie in your goals into what you might be doing in your current day to day job or focus it in those sort of skill sets that you already have. And the final one there is T for timely. So this is the fact that every goal needs to have a target date so that you have a deadline to focus on. So we just like to make sure that when our mentee pairings are setting their objectives, that they are time bound again, just to make sure that they have that ability to come back, reflect on them and decide if they have achieved that or not. Great. How about you, Selena, through your work with different organizations? What kinds of best practices and lessons learned would you like to share? Yeah, in my opinion, good practices at the beginning. Look at your organization and at your employees so you can identify where and what are the real needs. Other good practices is to properly structure the program to warranty at least five or six meetings between mentee and mentor. Share guides, forms, presentations, do a follow up and support the participants during the program is also very important. Great. Yeah. So as you both can probably imagine or attest to those types of mentoring programs can be met with some potential resistance or skepticism. So what strategies are would be effective to overcome those? Maybe Selena, start with you. Yeah, well, women represent, I mean, only the 24% of the total workforce in the industry and in leadership positions. So in this context, I think that, well, taking into consideration this context and that the barriers we mentioned before exist, we need to make them visible and commit employees to take action to reduce their impact. Mentoring should fit in a greater, greater D&I or development strategy. It's a great tool that it can generate a positive impact if it's a part of a bigger program with support of the senior management. And also it's important to show a positive aspect of mentorship that it helps generate role models for other women in the organization. So this is important to more junior female members of the team can see that it's possible to reach leadership positions. And for those. Okay. Yeah, Emily. So what strategies do you think can be implemented to overcome skepticism or resistance? So I think one thing we touched on earlier was sort of tackling unconscious bias. And actually there's a lot of different training programs available that sort of tackled that topic. You know, and part of that is breaking down the value on why we need to be aware of them, sort of getting over some preconceived ideas that people have that they might not have any biases themselves. You know, and that's not true. It's our natural way to sort of be able to process the world around us. We just need to make sure that we are conscious of our unconscious biases and how they might be affecting the decision making or the feelings that we might have towards such mentoring programs, such as when people have a bit of skepticism towards them. So we are trying to champion that at the minute within Halliburton and try to make sure that that training is completed by as many people as we possibly can. And, you know, it's not just our mentees who need to be sort of aware of that. It's our mentors as well. We need that to happen at all levels across all different roles as well. And another strategy I would really say is very effective is awareness campaigns. And as part of that, really celebrating the success stories that we have and not just when it's International Women's Day or perhaps a sort of a day of celebration that would be deemed as appropriate, right? We want to make sure that we are having regular communication from all different levels of leadership across our organizations so that people can see the value of talking about such programs, the value that these programs bring to individuals and to the company and how we can sort of break down some of those, again, some of those perhaps biases of that women can't be seen in those leadership roles and sort of eliminate the hurdles for them to get there. Yeah, great. Maybe we'll expand a little bit on one last part that you mentioned, and what value can we get out of those programs and making sure that this is visible? So how can companies measure the success and impact of their mentoring programs in advancing women into leadership roles? No problem. So the first assessment, I would say, of a successful program is the feedback that we receive and the awareness of that scheme spreading. So in our women's group mentoring program, we had six times more applicants to our 2024 pairings than we had in the previous year. But that does, you know, bring us challenges as well. As that program has expanded, we need to introduce sort of more detailed application forms so that we can move from coordinator matching, which was quite time consuming and often required personal awareness of each participant to a sort of more automated matching based on the areas of interest and the mental strengths. So we're going to be checking in with our mentoring pairings throughout the year to make sure that we're continuing to receive the feedback from them and can sort of assess and make changes to that program as we need to as we go through. In certain cases, we can be a little bit more insightful in measuring the success by tracking the roles and the role changes of our mental pairings. So, for example, we have a mentorship program where female employees are paired with executive leaders to help prepare them for country manager roles. So we can reflect on how many of those mentees now hold that position and what was successful in those pairings that we can re-replicate or look to sort of set up again for future people and continue to build on that success. Absolutely. Selena, what kind of measures or metrics should we track to understand the success of the mentoring programs? Yes, adding what Emily said, also, KPIs can be established to measure, for example, number of promotions, number of women in leadership positions, female turnover, and include some questions related to D&I in the work environment surveys. Great. So how do these mentorship initiatives contribute to breaking down gender barriers and promoting a more inclusive culture in a company? Maybe Selena, we'll start with you. Yeah, I think that it's about what we've been talking now. As I say, first of all, it's taking into consideration that these barriers exist. We need to make them visible and take action to reduce their impact. Yes, and as Emily said, you can make campaigns to train the people to understand that this is not a matter of opinion, but it's a fact. Yeah. And Emily? So in my mind, one of the most valuable factors of mentorship is the sharing of different perspectives. So considering challenges from an alternative point of view, really strengthening empathy and awareness of how the same situation can affect people differently, depending on their prior experiences or their current emotional state. So to give an example, at Halliburton, we start all of our meetings with a safety or a value moment. So this is a quick discussion on a topic to share awareness that everyone can learn from. And in a recent training course regarding business acumen, I noticed that the trainer was using male only examples when speaking about customers or decision makers and the business development employees, all using the he, him pronoun. So I shared a value moment there on the importance of gender inclusive language, and it was a really great way to open up that conversation about more inclusive language that could be used instead. And I mean, how many people on this session now have been in a group of people, including women and perhaps even non-binary employees, and being addressed to with morning gents? And we can so simply change that to good morning team or good morning folk, something that is a lot more inclusive of the audience that you can see. So in the examples of that training for when we're talking to about the customer, we can just refer to them as the client or they instead of having to use he or him. And the effect of using that male only language just wasn't something that they had personally ever considered. But after sharing the perspective that women need to be included in that conversation, they made the changes to the training course. And I think that that was a really positive way that we saw that by having that little moment of mentorship sort of opening up a bit of vulnerability and an ability to have that conversation really benefited everyone in that situation. Absolutely. And I guess what one thing we need to talk about is what role can male mentors play in supporting the professional development of women in our industry? So, Emily? So at Halibet, all employee resource groups are open to all employees. So within our women's group, we actively encourage men to get educated, to ask questions and learn to become better allies. And we foster that safe space for people to ask questions and better understand other people's perspectives. So in terms of what role male mentors specifically can play in supporting the development of women, we want to see them supporting initiatives that focus on women employees and follow through on those actions. We want them to be conscious about hiring women, building teams that include women and inviting women to the table. As you know, as we opened up this conversation, we talked about the strengths of having diverse teams and diverse thoughts in the room. And that shows us actually a strategic benefit to the company as well. We want our male role models to be advocates for women and not just when they are in the room, but, you know, discussing them in the meantime, you know, pulling up their name when people are looking for, you know, people who are interested in other career opportunities or to get involved in projects. And we want to see men included on panels and at events that relate to women's issues. We want to see that active allyship. So, you know, recent example, we recently celebrated International Women's Day. We want to see them involved in those discussions, championing those success stories that we've seen and celebrating with their team. So we think that that really shows that that topic is important to them as well. And it's not just, you know, lip service to the company. They're really trying to make sure that this is a change that is actively happening. Yeah, well, I share Emily's opinion. I think we need to make mentors being allies. Their participation is key and other value. And it's important that they take this perspective of we face different challenges. For me, it's important that they are willing to participate and they are willing to drive and be a part of this change. Very well said. Great. So thank you so much, Emily and Selena, for such great insights that you shared with us today. And thank you to our audience for the questions and comments that I'm sure Selena and Emily will address after the live and see you next time. If you enjoyed today's show, don't forget to subscribe and review. Join us next time on the SBE Live Podcast."
SPE Live Podcast: Fostering Future Leaders - The Impact of Mentorship on Women in Leadership,"This is SPE Talks to Trent Jacobs and I'm Jason Notouris. Welcome to the SPE podcast and Happy New Year's Eve. Trent, any big plans at midnight? Family traditions? Yeah, I might go out for dinner. Family traditions, we do we do something in our house. So we eat 12 grapes. I think it's like a Spanish. It's also Mexican tradition. So 12 grapes for good luck for the next 12 months. What about you? Nice. Tradition-wise, we have our Christmas tree and we take the Christmas ornaments off said Christmas tree and put New Year's decor on now New Year's tree. Okay, okay. I actually never heard of that. So but the tree's got to come down shortly after New Year's still though, right? Yes, very much so. But kudos to my wife. She had the idea. It looks great. She handles the decor. I stay away from it and our house is awesome. Okay and you've got some resolutions? A couple. Big resolution for me. Exercise a little bit more. I know it's cliche but got to keep the heart healthy. Yeah, no, I'm with you. I want to start trying to take walks after work and just you know get out into the outdoors especially when the sun's going down earlier. Try to get some more vitamin D while the sun's still up. Hey, it's free, right? That's right, at least for now. But on a serious note, I know that we've resolved to make this podcast reach new heights. The reason for this episode, the one you're listening to, is to say thanks for 2019. We loved launching the podcast in these first few months have created amazing memories but also we're looking forward to what else we can offer heading into 2020 and beyond. Yeah, no, I think it's been real exciting. It's been a sort of a growth exercise for the Society of Petroleum Engineers and we're just trying out this this new medium to see if we can bring some life to what otherwise is really covered with the written word and reach you guys wherever you are driving on the road, listening to this at the airport, that kind of thing. I mean, I know that we're making a difference already because we've been reading your comments online. We really appreciate them. Let's look at this one on Apple Podcasts from Konstantin Viedma. Says, a must for oil and gas professionals. Awesome! Exclamation mark. Very professional and deep podcast about the important trends and technical problems of the oil industry today. Guests are very experienced, knowledgeable, and bright personalities. Both exciting and extremely useful. So thank you, Konstantin. It's a nice little kudos and Trent, it's really a big reason why we made this podcast and why we offer a variety in our episodes. Yeah, yeah, we've talked about that a little bit. The SPE is not one thing, right? And so we have, you know, different programs. We reflect different disciplines and so for lack of a better term, you know, it's good to have the variety shows where we try to cover all those bases because we do have a very diverse global audience that's interested in all sorts of things. So talk about the episodes that you host. Yeah, well the first one was, you know, with George King and we talked about a pretty nuanced technical issue revolving around casing failures and unconventional wells and I think that was an episode that sort of typifies what we're trying to do here which is there's a lot of high-level information out there for everybody to gleam from but we wanted to spend some time and experiment with this podcast to see if we could get into the weeds on really technical subjects and do them some justice in a, you know, 25-30 minute format. And another interesting episode that you had that was very technical was Andrew Pepper. Yeah, yeah, Andrew Pepper, that was a cool one for me especially because when we think of oil and gas, you know, if you're a layman, you think that sort of all of its created equal and for those people in the industry they know that's not true but when we start talking about unconventionals even very knowledgeable people in the industry are still having, you know, issues and challenges trying to characterize the oil that's actually in the rock. How much is there? How much will actually come out? And Andrew's among a cadre of experts who are trying to figure that out with new techniques and analysis methods. And then so I navigate more of the career advice, our monthly SPE President episode, stories about contributions. As a whole I just want to share what our members and companies are doing to improve the lives of regular people on our planet. That kind of lines up with another one of our initiatives from 2019 that's launching the Energizing Our Lives website. So I'll leave a link to that in our show notes if you guys want to go check that out. And another interesting avenue that we're exploring is becoming even more global. We want to look to expand on our global guests. I was lucky enough to have one of the first international guests though. We had Canadian Kirstie Boyle come in from Interface Fluidics. We talked about startups, business tips, and I guess technically you could say that the President episodes are also they have a little bit of an international flair since Shana Noonan, the 2020 SPE President, also has some Canadian roots. And then on the side as another venture that we've gone out to, Trent, both you and Stephen Rossenfoss have this really interesting banter about some of the topics that are really trendy in oil and gas right now. Yeah, no, we, you know, Steve and I, our job is basically to go out there and look for emerging technologies. That was our mandate when both of us joined the SPE and, you know, emerging technology is a broad term, but it includes emerging techniques and emerging understandings as well. And so, so yeah, you know, you know, me and Steve like to nerd out on these things. And so it's really fun to take some of that cubicle chatter into the podcast world where we can sort of spread our passion for this business. Neither of us have an engineering background, but we've been spending years looking at these issues and really have a, you know, the respect for all the nuance that goes into what professionals in the SPE are trying to do. So, so yeah, we're really excited to just kind of, like I said, get out there and nerd out in public. And I think something that sums that up is what someone has written for us on LinkedIn. Jehan Shafi with the kind words, first class podcast. There isn't anybody better regarding the dissemination of PhD expert level, ONG content or information. I'll be sure to spread the word about hashtag SPE podcast. And that goes into Trent, just what you were saying about how you and Stephen can kind of break some of the staff. Yeah, yeah, I mean, exactly. I think that, you know, we live in a world where I think people just consider some things too complicated to really get across in a short amount of time. And I think a lot of oil and gas, technical issues and these physics problems that people are trying to solve, they fit into that category. Well, how in the world can you talk about that in such a short amount of time? But, but really, we know we think that we can, and we think that there's all sorts of ways to package information. We see that in a lot of other areas, whether it's, you know, sort of the mainstream media talking about, you know, complex economic issues. You know, there's a niche here in the oil and gas business for that kind of dialogue. And, you know, we're not the only ones feeling it, but we're really happy that we have our voices out there trying to be part of that conversation. We've discussed more of the why for creating the podcast. Let's get into the what. Some comments on specific episodes illustrate that just a little bit. Let's start with something from one of yours and Steve's episodes, real time fracturing, pressure monitoring and cube drilling. John G.M. writes, excellent topic. It's totally true. We have to be prepared to new oil industry. They may be switching the preposition to for so for the new oil industry. And and I know people were raving about your discussion with Nathan Meehan on the end of petroleum engineering as we know it. Yeah, and that one, you know, we we we picked that one as an episode because it was the most downloaded S P paper of the year and and had a very provocative title. But we think it's a good conversation to be having the industry is going through a lot of change. It's coming from, you know, various drivers and, you know, as we look into this world of automation, as we look into a world with possibly lower commodity prices, you know, people have to think about what that means for their careers. And obviously, our members are. And so we want to have those debates. We want to have those that that dialogue and the S.P. sort of the exact place that that should be happening. And for one of my episodes with yoga street per Don B. Hagee writes, this was an eye opening podcast on networking and throws a little bit of exposure on the oil and gas industry. Thank you. So I was thrilled to have yoga tree on the podcast. She's a reservoir engineer for Endeavor Energy Resources, bright young professional, well spoken, and she's really marketed herself well, specifically on LinkedIn. But she's really smart about growing her network at events and online. So she shared some of her tips and tricks during our discussion. And that's what makes a lot of these podcasts interesting, whether or not you're looking to build your career or you're looking to pick up some really interesting information that you need to solve a problem at your company through technical information. S.P. podcast is there to help you do that. And we do want to hear what you think about our topics in the podcast in general. So we do invite you to join the discussion on social media using the hashtag S.P. podcast. Let's read a few of those hashtag S.P. podcast shout outs on LinkedIn. John Burwell said membership value for S.P. has just shot through the roof for me. I know S.P. has been recording podcasts in September. I'm excited to add this to my current podcast lineup. And we got another one from Michael Bossette who said enjoyed the recent Society of Petroleum Engineers International podcast with Trent Jacobs and Stephen Rassenfos discussing the top 10 list of technologies and ideas to keep an eye on in the coming year. Pleased to hear a couple of nods to expertise and technologies being developed here in Alberta. So that's one from Canada. That's nice that we're getting all the way up north. And those are among the many more comments like those from Rogelio Herrera saying very good podcast. And Rob Bond said love this podcast. So just thank you everyone for listening. We just hit our 10,000 download milestone. Looking at our statistics, people from 134 different countries have tuned in. Just thank you. Thank you so much. We release episodes most every Tuesday morning. Yeah. And it's always a good time to download us and listen in on your trip to work, like I said, or if you're transiting to the oil field, you know, this is a podcast for people who are trying to learn more about this industry. And again, we just we love hearing from you guys and keep giving us your ideas and your reactions. And Trent, I've had a blast. Thank you so much for everything. Both you and Stephen have contributed to the podcast. This has just been a wonderful experience being able to work with the both of you. S.P.E. for facilitating us with the ability to do this podcast and reach the members and reach anyone who just needs to know more about oil and gas. Yeah. Well, thank you, Jason.

SPE Live Podcast: Hydrogen as Part of the Energy Mix ‚Äì Commercial and Technical Perspectives,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live addressing the energy challenge with fiber optic sensing. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on November 6th, 2023. And now your moderator, Dennis Dreha. Welcome to the SPE live addressing the energy challenge with fiber optic sensing. I'm Dennis Dreha. I am a Petroleum Technology Advisor for Midan Energy Consulting, and I'll be your moderator today. Today's SPE live will be lasting 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. Before starting our conversations, I'd like to invite you to attend the SPE workshop that's coming up on February 20th to 21st, 2024. Fiber Optic Sensing Applications for Field Development, Integrity, and Optimization, which will be held in London. At that workshop, we'll delve into the world of fiber optic monitoring technologies and unlock their immense potential in optimizing reservoir and field development and operations. We hope that you will join us at the forefront of innovation and exploration and well fiber optic sensing. To learn more about this workshop or to register, please scan the QR code that was in the graphic. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guests. We have a panel of three. The first is Andres Javarria. Andres is the Technical Director at Luna OptiSense, where he focuses on optimizing sensing tools in various fields, including energy, mining, earth systems, and infrastructure. He oversees a team of experts on fiber optic monitoring applications with over 20 years experience in earth science and engineering monitoring. He holds an engineering degree from UNAM and a PhD degree in geophysics from Duke University. Next up is Pierre Bettinelli. Pierre is currently the Reservoir Performance Fiber Optics Geophysics Technical Director for SLB located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This role consists of defining and implementing new workflows, both operational and software related, technical competency and training programs, hardware and overall digital architecture and boreholes seismic and fiber optic services. He has authored more than 20 technical papers and patent applications related to these topics. Pierre earned his PhD in geophysics from the IPGP, Caltech, and CEA. We also are very pleased to welcome Garth Naldrott. Garth joined SELIXA in 2015 in the capacity of Chief Product Officer, where he has led the development of the world's first subsea DAS system, as well as fiber optic subsurface stream monitoring systems and edge computing platforms. Prior to joining SELIXA, Garth was Vice President of Monitoring and Control at Tindika, which he joined through the Shell Technology Ventures Acquisition of FlowQuest, a software business he founded in 2006. Before founding FlowQuest, Garth was a fiber optic product champion at Schlumberger. Garth also serves on the board of the SPE Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Sessions. Andres, Pierre, and Garth, welcome to this SPE Live. Yeah, thanks everyone. Good. Thank you, Dennis. So we're going to kick this off and during the next 25 minutes or so, we're going to talk about the uses of fiber optics, what is new in the area, how it's being used in energy extraction and utilization, how it's extending the use in hydrocarbon energy reserve optimization and challenging, and then the progression of its use into low carbon energy and associated monitoring applications. I'm going to start off by asking Andres, can you tell us what is fiber optic sensing and what makes it so special? Yes, thanks, Dennis. And I think fiber optic sensing is super exciting and really what it boils down to is turning an existing fiber optic cable, the same fiber optic cables that we have in our phones, in our internet, but instead of transferring information from one point to another, what we do is turning each point along that fiber into a sensor that we can use to measure different things. So the way in which this works is essentially we connect to this and what we call an interrogator unit to these fiber optic cables. And this interrogator unit is going to be sending light down that fiber and a portion of that light is going to be reflected back. And what will happen is that when there is a change, whether it is on strain, on vibration or temperature, that character of that light is going to be changing. So the beauty of this is that all of a sudden we have all of these access to tables, but we can turn each point in them in a virtual sensor, not just turning it into a tool that sends information to one point to another. And what is very exciting about it is that we can detect very, very small temperature changes, very, very small strain changes, which makes it an incredibly sensitive tool. So whether we're looking at fluids, whether we're looking at seismic waves, we can detect a wide range of physical processes with these types of tools. So I can tell you from a seismic point of view, that data has become very versatile because all the sort of simple cable that you can bend, that you can put into very harsh environments can give us basically the response from other conventional geophones or other conventional seismometers, but at a fraction of a cost and with very high receiver density. So I think this sensitivity to again capture like tiny temperature fluctuations makes it into a super thermometer that can really allows us to see what is happening along that trajectory of that fiber, whether it is on a well or whether it's on a trench fiber or on a surface fiber or a submarine cable. We are really able to turn this into very sensitive tools over a very long range distance. That sounds like a lot of very interesting and potentially useful, extremely useful applications, but in an industry that is so conservative or quite conservative, what is the uptake with the operators that you're seeing? Yeah, and I think the uptake on the technology has been really massive. The first temperature applications was for temperature sensing almost 30 years ago in basically Wells, where it was impossible to acquire data with conventional tools. And again, nowadays there's entire instrumented fields that have fiber optic embedded in them that allows us to monitor the production, to monitor injection processes. From a seismic point of view, that's, we use what we call distributed acoustic sensing, and that's a little bit newer. That started almost 15 years ago when we were essentially monitoring pipelines over very long distances to look things for leaks or look for people who may be tampering with the pipeline. And someone had the idea of, oh, well, what happens if we turn that pipeline inside a well and start listening? And we started to record seismic. So now it really, DASC has become the go-to technology to do seismic measurements inside of Wells. And it really has replaced in many places conventional geophone technology to acquire seismic. And of course, seismology and earthquake applications have really taken off by using this type of technology. So increasingly more and more assets are making use of these tools, not just for temperature, but also acoustic and strain sensing. So as new processes are introduced, new challenges arise, new technology and technology enablers help meet these challenges. Pierre, could you give us some examples of these? Yes, thanks, Denis, and thanks, André. So I would like to extend a little bit on what André covered already on our site, but also importantly on the software side. So first, let's discuss about fiber optic hardware. So we are now enabling acquisitions, which we are not even discussing in the past due to logistic issues, such as shutting wells, removing completion, to running all geophones. Now with permanent fiber, we can perform such acquisitions without any different production. And this is very important thanks to the development on production noise removal during the production. Enabling time-lapse VSP for reservoir monitoring, but also compartmentalization to optimize production. On the other side, as André mentioned, we also have temporary deployment capabilities, allowing us to acquire seismic also almost transparent to rig time, which also fits to everyone's objectives on sustainability by reducing acquisition time and therefore CO2 emissions. So this is enabled by the hybrid wireline cable, which embeds fiber optic strength. And this is also, and here I'm not talking about fiber in metal tube, but really fiber that is embedded into the cable for a best transfer function in order to optimize the data quality. And André mentioned also about the interrogator box. I would like also to just mention that the interrogator itself is also improving on the regular basis. I'm used to say that it's like the same thing as I thought, you know, with the new improved version every six months to one year, which is also contributing to the overall improvement on the technology. Now, as I said, moving to software side. So we have a free sub-cadere, I will say, the pre-acquisition software, the acquisition software, and the post-acquisition software. So these three sub-categories allow us to provide a full end-to-end solution to achieve the objective. So let's go into more details by starting with the pre-acquisition software. So knowing what we can expect is a critical step. And we need basically to do a pre-survey modeling and to get capabilities to assess the image coverage. So as an example on seismic, considering also the cosine square analysis, because fiber optic amplitude recorded is linked to the cosine square of the incident angle at the receiver location, so at the fiber optic location. We can also perform that acquisition to assess the coupling of permanent cable as coupling will be also a key for seismic acquisition. So we need to know which interval is well coupled to the formation to determine what will be the outcome of that acquisition. And such operation should be performed while you install the fiber to optimize your chance of success. Coming back weeks or months later will be too late to react to the fiber expansion. On the acquisition side, there is also a very important key enabler that will be the QC in real time, the acquisition waveform. Source driven mode therefore acquisition will allow us to cross correlate in stack in real time. So this is also a critical aspect of the successful acquisition. As you cannot wait for weeks to QC the operation, so real time aspect is very important and software enable this QC in real time. Another important aspect for source driven mode acquisition is the volume of data. So you may know that that acquisition generates terabytes of data per day while recording in continuous mode. And this is basically the source driven mode is minimizing what you are recording because you are using basically the time zero of the source in real time and chopping the data that is just needed. Finally moving to the post acquisition side on the software. So the synthetic creation has been the key enabler to optimize the turnaround time allowing interpretation to take a critical decision quickly. So let me provide you two simple examples from simple to complex. So for example, VSCO elastic modeling is in one of the edge enabler. So we can now in depth and perform in a few minutes the VP and Q attenuation profile thanks to the fiber optic acquisition. Automatically without any human intervention. So without any picking you can now get VP and Q attenuation profile. So this is quite important to mention. And to basically add another example, the 2D elastic foo-boe forming version has been a key for complex designs such as walk away or multi-offset creating 2D VP, VCE, Repsilon, Delta, Tomogram as well as pseudo-reflectivity image in less than one day. So an important achievement on the market to take decisions in almost real time. So I hope I provided an overall aspect on the technology and what is done to enable it. Thanks Denis and I give you back the floor. Thank you Pierre. Garth, can you tell us your thoughts? What impact do you think fiber will have on the energy transition? Yeah, Denis thanks. Yes, I think that's a great point and actually I'll talk about exactly that. I think that's going to be a transition. So we're going to go through three phases I think with fiber optics. There's the conventional oil and gas that I think can optimize as a first point. Then there's alternative energies, there's geothermal applications and then there's the role in carbon capture and storage. So I think each one of those fiber optics has a role in it and I'll start off with the conventional oil and gas and I mentioned that as part of the energy transition because we will need conventional oil and gas for many years to come. So it's a question about how do we make those operations more efficient? How do we reduce the CO2 per barrel on those operations? And yeah, I think fiber optics has a key role to play for many of the reasons that Pierre and Andres they have already addressed. You know, I think for one we've got these multiple physics, temperature, acoustics and strain and they all have a very dense recording. You record them every one meter in the well bore and continuously in time. So we have very dense spatial and temporal information and we can use that information on the subsurface to get a better understanding and improve our optimization because you can't optimize without data and suddenly you've got this fiber optics system in place that's going to give us vast amounts of data. So how can we optimize this conventional operations? I think there's key areas that we touched on, seismic. So you know, by having this vast array it becomes very efficient to acquire seismic acquisitions. So rather than, you know, maybe acquiring seismic acquisition every two years or every five years, we have some customers acquiring seismic on a daily basis. So that time lapse understanding of seismic becomes far more powerful. Because these receivers, the fiber optics are in the well bore, we also get a much better seismic response via higher frequency content, so higher resolution in the subsurface. So that gives us a much better map of that subsurface, we're able to better position the wells, target our brilliant programs and understand how to optimize there. So I think in the seismic aspect there's huge benefits. Then there's production optimization and with production optimization we can look at things like the artificial lift, how can we use it to optimize artificial lift, better use that lift energy. So things like gas lift understanding how the gas lifts are operating, understanding which gas lift valves are operating at one time, when do they need replacement. Fiber optics have shown great case studies and potentials here. ESP monitoring, listening to your motors and your pump, you know, there's a lot of surface application in process plants when you've got rotating machinery you'll have a lot of measurements on that. But in the subsurface we haven't tended to do that, but suddenly with fiber objects we can have this dense array of acoustic strain and temperature. So again with ESP monitoring we can improve a lot. And then again across the reservoir production logging isn't applied very often. A lot of wells will go many years without a production log placed, but with a fiber optic in there you can run the fiber across the reservoir and understand the flow profiles. You can see where the production is coming from. If you've got any phase breakthrough water or gas you can understand that very quickly without having to wait for a production log. So I think just as speaking around these conventional operations even in the energy transition I think we can use what we're doing much more efficiently and lowering the carbon footprint because we don't need to deploy people to these well sites to take these measurements. All of this is done permanently installed without putting people on the well site. And then we move into carbon capture and storage and I think there this is a very very rapidly developing area. We know the importance of taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and storing it in geological formations, but it's relatively young and not really completely understood industry. And I think fiber optics has a key role to play there in one for around green lake requirements, but making sure that we inject in the CO2 safely that we're not causing any events that cause the industry to slow down or stop. So I think kind of making sure that there's good integrity during the injection, making sure that the CO2 stays in place, the fiber optics we can monitor the movement of the CO2 boom through the seismic techniques I explained previously. We can listen to induced seismicity to make sure to say that it's a safe injection of the events. So I think in the CCUS industry we've really seen a great update of fiber optics to make sure we can do this safely and efficiently. And then on the alternative energies geothermal I think begin that combination of DTS so we can understand the thermal transfer and geothermal fields, understand the injection of production process. For the distributed acoustics we can understand the stimulation of the reservoirs, we can efficiently design the wells, the spacings, how far apart they are. So I think in those three key areas fiber optics has got a big role to play in the energy transition space. Dennis, we can't hear you at the moment. Sorry about that. In our discussions we've heard several new technologies and technology neighbors. What are some of the latest developments in neighbors to help bring fiber optics to relevancy in the energy transition? Will we hear about some of these at the upcoming workshop? And I'll start with Pierre. Thanks Dennis. So yeah, I mean one of the latest developments that I found very exciting is a real-time micro seismic monitoring enabled by machine learning. So I mean it has been mentioned by Garrett. So I mentioned previously the DAS technology generates terabytes of data per day. Therefore it is very difficult even, I will say impossible to transfer all this data in real time. And this is where the machine learning embedded into the interrogator box play a huge role. So automatically detecting the event, sending to turn only the usable data, avoiding sending unwanted data such as the background noise. So this is also, I mean removing the need of the full processing unit at age as fiber optic monitoring will be the technology, cost-effective technology for CPS and geothermal live projects. So consequently automation will be needed to achieve self-ambition and I'm glad to mention that we achieved the first step with the machine learning embedded in the interrogator box. Oh, thank you Pierre. Andres, your comments. Yeah, I think at the end of the day what fiber is enabling Dennis is that let's say in these areas like CCUS, geothermal like these newer sources of energy that the longevity of the fibers, I think that's what makes the technology so exciting that it really makes them suitable for very long-term surveillance. We now have validated that these fibers can detect all types of induced events. Of course safety is a very important aspect of everything we do with any source of energy. It doesn't have to be oil and gas. It can be nuclear. It can be wind. We want to make sure that our operations are safe and I think the ability of having a sensor like a fiber that can last for, I don't know, 2,500 years and you can continue to use it. And now that we have validated it against conventional tools, I think really should bring peace of mind to society, to our regulators that we have basically the tools to monitor things, to monitor the process, to monitor the operations that we are conducting in our reservoirs. Certainly as you're injecting things into the ground, whether it is water to generate geothermal resources or CO2 for storage, we want to make sure that it is conducted safely. So I think fiber optic technology does provide that type of sensing capability that allows us to really keep track of what we are doing. Thanks Andres. Those comments, Garth, your thoughts? Yeah, I think probably to wrap up some of the thoughts that particularly Pierre and Andres have captured over there. I think it works hand in hand very well. I think it's a very with the data science and engineering analytics applications. You can't do data science without data and world wars traditionally haven't had a lot of data installed in them. They've had one pressure temperature gauge. Suddenly we've got this vast amount of data, so it really supports data science applications. But also we can't use fiber optics without data science as Pierre mentioned there. There's vast amounts of data. We've got to use tools that are efficient and touched on artificial intelligence, you know, being able to automatically detect and identify data. I think that's going to be very key. Digital twins, you know, these can be a lot more efficient if we're using some measurements to constrain the digital twin rather than the optimization. So I think that part goes hand in hand. And then also the visualization, I think the efficient visualization techniques so that we can effectively mine this data will be very important part too. Thanks, Dennis. Great. Thank you, Gareth. We're like to getting close to the ending here and I'd like to open up to some questions. The first one we have is from Steve Mathias. And the question is, a lot has been said about distributed sensing. What are the thoughts on the use of discrete optical sensors as well for a complete optical system? For example, eight pressure and temperature sensors, flow sensors, and three component seismic sensors. I can go, I can take a stab at it first. And then certainly I think distributed sensors are very important because they provide us again a very wide aperture of linear acids, whether it's a whale or a pipeline. But of course point sensors they are going to be giving you an absolute measurement. Oftentimes we need other types of sensors to complement our measurements. So I don't think we are fully replacing a lot of conventional point sensors, but really enhancing and basically providing a wider illumination. But I think conventional gauges, some certain types of flow meters that really can allow us to separate certain types of signals will still be important for different types of aspects in our acid monitoring. Great. Okay. Yeah, I can also add to what Andres has said there. I think if you make an investment of installing fiber optics into the well board, then I think the point sensors add a tremendous amount on top. And in the same way, if you were running a production logging tool, you would ideally put as many sensors on that production logging tool as you can. If you're running a permanent system, you want to put as many sensors as you can there, including point sensors and now with pressure temperature sensors. If you put optical pressure temperature sensors onto the cable, of course you can potentially remove the electrical cables in the well. So again, it makes sense to go to an all optical system. Optical flow meters again, they're probably going to provide you better accuracy. So very easy to deploy those if you already have made the investment of putting the fiber optic cables in the well and better constrain things like your flow estimation. So I think it has a perfect place in combination with the distributed sensors. Yeah, I have another question that I would like to add. I mean, we are all very excited on this topic. So I would like also to add on the workflow side. So there is already workflows that are incorporating the discrete and distributed measurement. So let's say on microstatic CT for example, where we basically develop some workflows where you can basically combine both in order to minimize uncertainty. So there is some workflows available on this aspect. Okay, we have a question that's come in from Daniel Hinger. What is the maximum temperature rating of the fiber optic systems currently in the market that can be used in the geothermal applications? About 500 to 700 degrees there, Dennis, and they are high temperature fibers that will go up to that. Okay. Degree Celsius that is. Okay, that's quite impressive temperature range. From Doug Walser, can you talk about industry improvements related to distinguishing fiber optic strain inside the fibers protective casing from strain caused by movement in the surrounding rock or tubulars? So it's a question about strain transfer and what are you actually able to pick up the rock strain from something that is isolated by several layers? I can take that one now. Go ahead. Take any questions from my colleagues. Yeah, there are a couple of systems that have been installed for measuring rock strain, compaction subsidence type measurements. There's good transfer from the rock onto the cable, particularly if it's casing conveyed systems. So yes, these systems have been around and I think a handful of these systems installed and some of them have been published as papers. Yeah, if I may add just one comment on that is that now we understand that different types of fibers may transduce certain signals a little bit different. So oftentimes we make coupled temperature and strain, but now we have special fibers that can basically separate more of the pure strain response. And the same, not just the fiber, also the interrogators that can track absolute strain versus absolute temperature. So increasingly we're doing a very good job at separating signals of interest depending on the application. Okay, we have, although we have other questions, we're pretty much out of time. So I'd like to just wrap this up and thank our panelists for and also for attending to consider joining us in February and Arctic sensing applications. That's February 20 to 21st. Thanks everyone and we'll see you next time. Yeah, thanks, Dennis. Thanks for the SP. Thanks for the invitation. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast.

SPE Live Podcast: Application of the UNFC to Geothermal Energy Resources,"You're listening to the SPE podcast. I'm Paige McCowan and we're talking about how current technology can help us through this downturn with Duncan Blue. Welcome everybody. And Duncan, thank you for your time for joining us today to talk. Oh, absolutely. I enjoy these kinds of things and I think it's needed for us to figure out what's happening out there. Exactly. It's the way of the future. I think we're going to be doing virtual stuff for a while, I believe. Yeah. So I wanted to kind of dig into your background because I thought there were a few things that were pretty interesting. You say your most famous accomplishment is heading up the team that rebuilt the Baker Hughes rig count system. You hold a patent on that process. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah, it was an interesting story. This, if you think about when Baker Hughes switched to the new site, God, look, night is probably almost 20 years ago, but the president of the company had, I was working for Hughes Christensen at the time and the president of Baker had gone to some conference and he got buttoned told by a president of a fairly large oil and gas company and said, you're lying. The numbers are wrong. You're misrepresenting what you're saying. And that didn't go over very well. I can imagine. So I was sitting in my boss's office and he came storming in and he was yelling and screaming at my boss and they, he said, we've got to do something about this. Take care of this now. And they both turned around and looked at me and said, okay, you're in charge. Fix it. And they both walked out at the time. It was from just around World War II is when Baker Hughes or Baker, or actually Hughes Christensen was counting the rigs and it was done on a very informal basis. They, a bit salesman or a bit runner would run out to a rig. He would mark down a little piece of paper. I was on H and P one 27 in Brazoria County, Texas. And that was about all they knew. And they would come back and compile all that. And once a week publish it. Well, rigs, rigs move, things happen. Things go up and down. Over the years, they had to define what a, the rig count really was. And it's quite different than most people think. The Baker Hughes recount is the active operating rigs that are actively drilling. They're not doing work over work. They're not doing completion work. They're not stacked, but getting paid. So a lot of the different rig count numbers that you see will vary for the Baker number simply because they're counting different things. Well, Baker said it's not active unless it's producing a revenue for service companies and various things and opportunities to make more home. So we decided we needed to look at how that account was being taken. And we made a decision to go from a counting system to an accounting system. The debits and the credits. Yeah. So if, if, if a salesman were assigned a particular group of rigs in his, his sales area, he had to know where all those rigs were. And if it moved out, we had to figure out where it was moving out too. So it, it, it debited his account and credited another salesman's account. So by following that rig, we were able to better, uh, justify where all those rigs were. It was a very interesting process. And I came up with the idea. I said, wouldn't it be cool instead of having columns and rows, let's put it on a GIS type map. And that was when the GIS systems were just starting to come out so that we could actually follow where those rigs were moving from one area to the other, from one week to another. But it was a, it was, it was a really fun project and I'm kind of proud of our team because we actually came in under budget and under time and presented a fairly, uh, important piece of information. I think we did some tracking on it. It is the, at the time for probably 10 years, at least it probably still is one of the most widely used websites, uh, in the oil and gas industry on a daily basis. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's always being quoted, um, you know, when you're looking at statistics and stuff. Well, yeah, that was quite a project. And come in under time and under budget. That's rare. Yeah. Of course it was good that I didn't have a budget to start with. I could fine tune it as I went along until I said, yeah, here's the number. Yeah. And made sure that my number was less than the number I turned in. That's a good project manager. Yeah. It's always good when you've got control of that. Yes. Um, also what I find interesting about your background is how you actually got into the oil and gas industry. You didn't study to get into the oil and gas industry, but you, um, but you got into it and you have a pretty long history in there. Tell me a little bit about how you got into it. Yeah. I have a undergrad degree in business and, and, uh, I actually started to work first right out of college. I worked for a bank. Uh, I discovered I didn't like working in a bank. And, uh, uh, a friend of mine, you know, uh, well, actually my roommate at the time, his dad was a geologist and he says, Oh, I can get you a job as a mud logger and I said, great, get me a job as a mud logger. What's a mud logger? And so I started working for the original mud logging company that slumber J had, it was called the analysts and, um, went to work for them, ended up going, uh, spending about a year in Singapore, working in Southeast Asia. Came back, moved up in the company and, uh, uh, have bounced around since then. So my background has always been mud logging. I have a, I have an MBA, uh, and I'm one of the few people, I guess, in the industry that is not a geologist, not an engineer, but at any one given point in time, when I was heading up the bud logging operation for Baker or the help mud logging operation for Halliburton, I probably had a thousand geologists working for me, so I don't know that as many asset managers out there, they can say the same, uh, so it has been a very interesting career. I'll yeah. And I also hold several patents on some down-hole tool technology, some managed pressure drilling technology. Uh, again, it's, it's, it's been in the right place at the right time, having some very good engineers working for me. But, uh, uh, also, I actually contributed quite a bit to several of those patents. One of them, I happen to be in the room and they had to put my name on the, on the patent, I'll, I'll fess up to that one, but, but, but, but several of the others I had direct input as to, uh, uh, what, what the technology was doing and what it needed to be done. So it's been fun. Good. SPE is proud to co-sponsor the energy and data webinar series, engage and connect with the energy and data community from anywhere in the world by participating in our monthly webinars on the 30th of July at 8 a.m. central time, tune in with Sashi Gunturu and learn about subsurface data engineering. Join us for this great learning experience by visiting energyanddata.org to register. Now the energy and data webinars are powered by AAPG, SEG and SPE. Before we delve into technology more talking about the opportunities in the oil and gas field, this is a question SPE gets a lot from our student members and our recent graduates. Why should they go into the oil and gas business? You know, especially right now with the downturns, um, it's a very cyclical in, uh, industry and a lot of people who haven't been in it as long as you have, or maybe possibly I have, um, they don't see the ups and downs. So what kind of advice would you get them about pursuing a career in the industry? Well, I think if, if the students that have come out do realize that it is a very cyclical industry, I mean, you're, you're living on top of the mountain one, one week and you're living under the bridge another week and it's going to be like that. I don't think there's, unfortunately, I don't think there's going to be a lot of changes in that, but my advice would be it's, it's probably, and I have a lot of friends that are in aerospace and medicine and a lot of other areas, but there's no other industry that I've ever seen that a young grad can come out, go to work for a company, be it an oil and gas, an operator or, uh, off field service company and be given pretty much a green light with large budgets to, to bake it or break it. And you won't, you won't get fired if you fail, um, until you get higher up at the organization, because you're not supposed to fail at that point in time. But as a young engineer, you, you are able to do a lot of things that a lot of other engineer grads cannot do simply because of the fact that that's, that's how they all feel works. You go out there and try, make, make, make things happen. And even if the project's a failure, technically, sometimes a lot of information is learned from those failures that are as valuable to the company as anything else. Right. And it could lead to a breakthrough, you know, major breakthrough technology and the way we do things. Correct. Absolutely. Absolutely. Some of the best, some of the best things that I've seen happen is because some bright guy's idea didn't work and we figured out how to, how to make that better, completely different from what that original concept was. Right. And it's all the point in the road that we get to, right? Absolutely. Okay. Well, let's get to our main topic at hand. Uh, so we reached out to you, um, for this podcast about an article you wrote in the May issue of the journal of petroleum technology. Um, you talked about oilfield life after the COVID-19 crash. You started your article by saying, this crash reminds me of the REM song, the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine. Actually that could be kind of scary, but tell us why you feel fine about that. Well, I wrote the article basically because about that time when the entire world was crashing, we didn't know about the COVID-19, the full measure of it. It absolutely scared every government globally. Everything was, it was like, get out on the highways of Houston and you could drive 90 miles an hour and never see anybody for 15 minutes. And that's just unheard of at the same time, the earnings calls for the, the slumber, J. Halliburton Baker, Weatherford were all coming out. They were all preaching doom and gloom. They said they were cutting each company basically said, we're going to cut a billion dollars out of our spend. Having been in the technical groups of a lot of those companies, I knew what that meant. They were basically completely shutting technology down. That meant they were, they were, they were laying off all their technologists, their, their engineers, their R and D people. They were shuttering buildings. They were, they were completely slashing and burning budgets for any projects in the pipeline now or any future pipeline. So when I said the end of the world, as we know it, yeah, that was, that's what was happening. I put the caveat in there is I feel fine for a couple of reasons. Number one, there's a lot of great technology that has been developed probably in the last three years that are being completely underutilized in the industry, either the sales groups have not done a very good job of presenting that information to the operators and their need or the operators on the other side have been, had this concept of the factory drilling. Let's just punch as many wells as fast as we can. I actually got in trouble at an SPE talk a couple of years ago when I said, I am so glad to see that the drillers are starting to use technology, but a Xerox machine is the wrong kind of technology to be using. I got a lot of nasty looks at that conference, but, but I stand by it. And I think it was true. They were trying to do too many things too quickly, trying to cut, cut corners on everything they could and just not using some of the new technology that could help them find more oil and gas. So why I say it's a, it's a good thing is that maybe some of the, the pullback will be, we have limited budgets. The cost of production has not changed. Our economics have changed. We, we had no longer operating at $80 a barrel oil. We're down to doing evaluations on 25 to $30 a barrel oil. So when we drill a well, we better make sure that we have some good ways of making sure that we have some hydrocarbon down there that we can produce. So some of this new technology, both in down hole sensors, some of the surface measurements that are being taken on geochemistry today on cuttings and, and that type of thing, the, the gas chromatography and the various things that can be found with some of the new technology that's out is going to be a tremendous boon going forward for the next several years and potentially help the industry find some more hydrocarbons. So that's why I kind of feel good about it. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right about the technology. And I think we're going to be looking more towards technology to create efficiencies in the field. Well, absolutely. And, and, and I've always thought that, uh, God, this, this, this is going to sound horrible because I've made my living doing it. But most of the companies were overinflated to the number of employees they had. And, and thinking that the only way that they could get productivity out of employees is if you went into the office at six in the morning and left at five in the afternoon and had to be there face to face with everybody, I think if anything, this, this, this COVID pandemic has taught us just as you and I are doing right now, we can do a lot of things in remote locations, carry on meetings, um, uh, be just as effective. We have to, it's, it's a new way of a new way of working in a way of learning. But I think the oil and gas industry is probably one of the last that have done this, uh, you look at medical, you look at, you know, if you, if you're in the medical industry, if you're a, uh, uh, an X-ray specialist, you'd never go into the office, you sit at home and look at your computer and do your analysis. Petrophysicists and geophysicists could be doing the same thing in their own home. Looking at the logs, look at the data that's coming across and making it just as many good, good decisions as possible. So I think we're seeing some big changes that are good. The remote operations I've been involved in remote operations for many, many years has never been taken very seriously, but all of a sudden it's come to the forefront. And, and the companies that are doing that right are being very successful at it. And, and their productivity are there, their customer's productivity is going way up on that. So we're, we're seeing some great things happening in that respect. So yeah, the, the digitalization is particularly the way we work is, is, is going to be changing to be a big impact on, on the future for us. Yeah. And especially if you compare it to other downturns, um, you know, 2015, 2016, we cut a lot of people and we never really got back up to that point. We were before that. So I think, you know, being lean and working, um, with, uh, more production and less employees is kind of what we're looking at moving forward. Now, how do you compare this downturn with some of the others? I've heard you compare it to the 1983 downturn before. Yeah, that was more of the economic side. Uh, if you look at the, the 80 to 83 crash, uh, which was pretty dramatic at the time, that's when, you know, prior to that, we were running almost 4,000 rigs in the U S whereas this time we were running just around 2000. So that proved that with half the rigs, we could still outproduce anything we ever did historically, which is a good thing, I guess, but economically it's like, it's a lesson that we keep hitting ourselves in the head with a hammer. And we don't seem to learn it. Uh, the, the, the, the, the point I brought up in several other conversations I've had on the 82 83 crash was how the industry had been financed. Uh, by the investment bankers and the bankers. And yet at the same time, um, they, they screwed that one up. They screwed this one up as bad as they did that last one. Uh, and what I'm saying is the investment community doesn't, they're not experts in oil and gas. They rely on us as being experts. We think we have the next best thing and very often that next best thing really isn't any better than the last best next thing and, and, uh, our, our, our, uh, find rate is not much better than it was 50 years ago. Uh, we still drill, you know, for, for every exploration well, this drilled only one out of 10 is a fine that we still screw up nine of them. Uh, we have the right technology very often. We're not using it properly, uh, in that fine. But we still, there's people with a lot of money that think that, you know, they, they believe us when we say we're going to make millionaires of them overnight. Just give, just give me, just give me $10 million and I'll drill that well. And it'll, and you're going to get a hundred million back. There's a lot of gullible people out there. I related it back to a book that was written back in the eighties called funny money about a little bitty neighborhood bank in Oklahoma city called Penn square bank. Uh, when I say a little bitty bank, it's the kind of bank you go to, to, I need a new roof on the house or I want to buy a car. That was a traditional loaning lending that they would practice. And one of their VPs came up with the idea of, of, Hey, we're in the oil and gas country, let me start making some oil and gas loans. Well, at the same time, McKinsey and company, uh, was, was, uh, consulting with chase and, um, Oh, I can't remember the other bank at the time. The other bank was the seventh largest bank in the country. They said, you need to get an oil and gas. They turned to Penn square because this guy had written some articles and had given some talk, excuse me, given some talks and they were literally Penn square was writing loans on a guy sitting in the broom closet with a board on his lap, signing away loans and immediately turning around and selling them to chase and, and, and, uh, Continental Illinois. Well, there were all bad loans. The whole thing collapsed around. Continental Illinois actually went out of business, the seventh largest bank in the country. It nearly dragged chase down into bankruptcy. Uh, so we're seeing that today where I think a Reddit article from, uh, it was published last year that there were only six operators in a positive cashflow situation in the Permian. Uh, that's scary when you consider there were probably over 3000 operators in the Permian basin. The rest of them were either, uh, losing money or trying to beg for more money. And, and, and the only thing that kept production up in the Permian was the fact that they were drilling well, so fast that the, the, the decline rate was, was almost outpacing the drilling rate. So that was, that was a very bad situation. And then consider that the economics, you know, the, the operators are constantly pounding the service companies over the head to reduce their costs. And yet the economics were bad from the start when they were, they were leasing properties in the Permian for anywhere from 60 to $90,000 per acre. Whereas if you drill a conventional well in South Texas or South Louisiana or Mississippi, you're looking at $200 an acre. That's, that's, that's where the money was going. So it, it, it, it, it was a, it was a bad situation from the start that it, it just ended up, we ended up burning ourselves out. So we have, we have to do a better job of that in the future. Cause right now I can promise you, you're not, you cannot raise a single dollar to drill an oil gas well pretty much anywhere right now. No, not right now. You've got to go with what you have for the time being. Much of the work of the society of petroleum engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SPE programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other SPE members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location, or experience level to learn more about the world of petroleum. And if you're interested in learning more about the world of petroleum, or experience level to learn more about the league of volunteers, visit spe.org slash volunteer. So if we talk about the technology again, you had mentioned that technology, probably the development of technology is probably halted at the moment. And then it'd probably take a few years to get it back up and running. Do you think we could do more with less? Yeah, I think, I think the secret is, and it's, it's not, not a big secret. It's something that we've, we've seen over the decades in the only gas industry, the real technology developments haven't come from the very big major. Companies. Uh, the big major companies sell the big, the technology. What ends up happening is a small, uh, niche company, a boutique company, a brilliant guy with a great idea, develop something, and then he sells that technology to the major company. Um, so all of the real big developments over the years have come from that. And, and I see some very, very good small boutique companies like that. Uh, right now, uh, one, one that comes to mind is, is, and it goes back to the data center concept and artificial intelligence, and it's, it's a little company called Corva. Carver started up a couple of years ago with the concept of trying to do what Baker slumber J and Halliburton were doing with their data centers, but they looked at it and said, we are getting tremendous amounts of data coming across every day, let's use some of the artificial intelligence and machine learning that these guys had learned from other industries, hired the right expertise, a small group of how do we use this in oil and gas and built some very good artificial intelligence machines, taking in the data that, that there, that was available and turning it into proper answers. So to take that workload off of the engineer, let the engineer do the thinking and not the monitoring. And so you see little boutique companies like that, um, that have done, you know, things like the top drive, uh, when I started in the industry, all the drilling was done with rotary systems, rotary tables. Well, the top drive came along and everybody said, Oh no, I'm not, I'm not going to put that on my rig. It costs too much money. A lot. You're going to be hard pressed to find a drilling rig today that doesn't have a top drive. The same thing with rotary stirruples. Everybody said we've been drilling rotor directional wells for the last 200 years using a single shot survey and a, and a, and a mud motor. Well, again, rotary stirruples came along and, and it has tremendously boosted LWD, MWD, all of those things have been developed and a lot of them were from, from smaller companies that were bought up by the major OFS companies to sell back to the industry. So that's where I see, that's where I see the future. The small real smart people coming together, putting their ideas and developing it out. I think where the, the big, the Halliburton's, the Slumberjays and the Bakers messed that whole concept up is from the direction of the operators. When the operator said, Hey, let's see if we can bundle all of these things together, give you a red rig, a blue rig, a light blue rig, so that we'll get a better price. Well, what ends up happening is they're buying the technology. For example, the rotary stirruple system and, and forcing the off-field service company to throw in things like mud logging for free. Well, I guarantee you nothing's for free. Either, either they're going to increase the price of the rotary stirruple system or the ones that they need are, it will be for free, but that means that there's no investment in the mud logging group. They're not training their people properly. You're not going to get the highest quality service. Whereas the independent mud logging companies are going to come in. They can't bundle because they don't have MWD, LWD or rotary stirruples, but end up giving you a better job and a better bang for the buck. So I think there needs to be a, another shift back into let's get away from this bundling prospect, put the right service company for the right prospect or project together, and then evaluate it as we go along. And not necessarily, you know, you've got a 10 year contract with everything and, and just, and that never works. It never really works. Yeah. Um, and, and plus you're seeing a lot of the, um, large OFS companies merged together. So a lot of it out there, um, you know, you've got one or two to choose from and these smaller companies, like you said, maybe they're really good at, at, at one little niche thing and they can get in and make a big difference. Absolutely. Uh, yeah, yeah. Cause what ends up happening is, uh, I going back to the mud logging, cause I don't know that the best, but there are measurements of the rocks that only a mudlarker can give you that even the best LWD or wireline is, if you think about it, it's an indirect measurement. It's sending a, some sort of electromagnetic wave out or recording the electronics back of what's happening down hole. Whereas the mudlarker actually touches the rock, sees the rocks, tastes the rocks, analyzes the rocks, they're analyzing the gases coming out. It is the direct look at those rocks of what's happening down there. It's the only look up the rocks. Uh, cause if you face it, we don't core that many wells anymore. So you don't get the full core. Sidewalk, sidewalk cores have their own problems. Cuttings have their own problems, but it's a lot cheaper. I used to, when I, when I go out and make, make presentations said, Hey, you're, you're, you're creating the cuttings for free. Why throw them away? Let's analyze them. So we're starting to see some of the new technology come out, scan electron microscopes, all the geochemistry, uh, methodologies that are out there, rock properties that we can actually measure from those cuttings that used to take months and weeks or months. Now it can be done at the well site real time. So there's a lot of really good information that can be available at a, at a cheaper price than LWD wireline, a little bit more of the traditional mud logging, but give you the right answers. Cause after all the hydrocarbons are in the rocks. We don't just happenstance fall upon them. So we need to know where we are. Right. Yeah. It's not the Beverly hillbillies anymore. No, just comes flowing out of the ground, shooting at some food and getting some crude, right? Yeah. A lot of young people don't understand that reference. Are you considering becoming an SPE member? When you join SPE, you join a society of dedicated professionals, just like you working to address the technical challenges of the global oil and gas industry, SPE membership gives you the opportunity to make local and global connections and build a network of influential technical leaders from every discipline, learn more at SPE.org slash join. Let's get your crystal ball out. Sure. What, what do you see happening over the next, I don't know, 18 months or so, you know, through production and through cutbacks. Yeah. I think what, you know, we're in a pretty dodgy situation right now. We don't know what the demand is going to be. We, we, we, we saw the demand go through the floor when historically the futures market went to what $14, negative $14, which is, which is stupid, but it's pure speculation and scare. But I think we're at a base now of about 35 to 40, it'll fluctuate like that. I don't see it going up much faster. I think the demand for oil is down quite a bit because of the continued lockdown that we're seeing globally. We're not, we're not moving in air. Airlines are, are, are suffering horribly. So we're not flying anywhere. We're seeing a few more cars on the highways and roads, but not anywhere near they were. So the demand for the liquids are not there. We are seeing some movement in the gas and I think that natural gas is going to, it's going to be a little bit stronger. I'm, we're doing, I'm doing some work with, with a, with a group. We're trying to raise some funds for some drilling and we're seeing that nobody will even look at us with oil prospects. All they want to talk about is gas. So that tells me the money is, is right now looking at the gas side of it. Uh, because I think this winter we're going to see a pretty good demand rise up for, for our natural gas. Um, but my question, do you think that's because of the cost? Um, or why do you think that? Yeah, yeah, part of it. I just think it's the demand that the liquid, the liquids are not there. And, and, uh, and, and what we're seeing is once the permeance started shutting down, all the associated gas with that, they were either flaring it or trying to, they were paying people to take it away. Some of that payment was to, for companies to take it away and burn it off at a major site or to pay just to fill into pipelines. So I think with that production and the Permian dropping off, all of a sudden, the gas pipelines are going to start, uh, pulling on vacuum and they've got to replace it because, you know, we're getting off a coal and, and, and a lot of the power plants now have, have moved back to, to gas. And, and, and we know as much as we'd like to see renewable energy work, it's just not there yet. Um, uh, it has its own problems and the only way you can stay alive is through government subsidies. Uh, the future, the future may be there, but not yet, but right now we're stuck with, with gas. The good thing about the gas is it's, it's probably the cleanest burning hydrocarbon that's out there. Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's cheap, it's reliable, and we have a lot of it. Um, unfortunately, I've also discussed the, the lack, the complete lack of energy policy in the United States. If we really had a true energy policy, uh, that doesn't mean that we would nationalize the oil and gas companies. It would mean that we would, we would force them into a situation where we have certain goals, then goals are rewarded or penalized based on, on those goals. And if the government were serious about it, we would give a tax break to everybody to convert their, their automobile from gasoline to natural gas. Um, it's about a $1,200 conversion. Uh, it's, it's, it's a lot cleaner. The natural gas is a lot cleaner burning. It's not quite as efficient, but tremendous opportunity there for us to, to have a true energy policy. That's something I'd love to see, but we don't have that. But, uh, but I think the future does, it's not, it's not a very bright future. I don't see any big expansion. I don't see any big movement. Uh, I think you're going to see some consolidations, uh, both in the operator side that we're already starting to see and, and particularly in the oil field service company side. There's, there's just, there's, there's, there's too many service companies doing the same thing. We're going to see a reduction in the number of drilling contractors, and we're going to see a dramatic reduction in the number of operators that are out there. So, uh, it's, it's a pretty bleak future as far as, uh, anybody trying to get a job in the next year or two, um, other than them creating their own job by starting their own company, being one of those niche companies that they can do something a little bit unique and, and, and different, being an innovator of some sort, you know, coming up with. That was one thing, um, you know, we had a, um, an SPE live event talking to, um, department heads of petroleum engineering, and they said the one qualification they're looking for are problem solvers. Yeah. So that's absolutely. And it can be anywhere in the industry. Just someone with a bright idea that realized they can't boil the ocean, but they sure can boil a coffee cup at a time, uh, solve the problem, uh, come up with some unique ideas, realize you're going to, you're going to have some failures in there and, and, uh, and, and, but, but be innovative and, and be brave, because I guess what, you know, they, they say when you're at the bottom of the barrel, you, you don't have much to be brave about, you just jump in and do what you got to do to get out, you know? So I think we're at that stage right now, but I see some, I see some good things happening, uh, I, I stay on LinkedIn quite a bit and I see, I see a lot of colleagues that are starting to get some jobs. They, you know, as the companies are reopening, they won't need as many,"

You're listening to SPE Live Pre-ATCE Series, Fueling Innovation, Navigating the Oil and Gas Startup Journey. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on April 22nd, 2024. And now your moderator, Naeem Chowdhury. Hello, welcome to SPE Live Pre-ATCE Series. Today's episode titled Fueling Innovation, Navigating the Oil and Gas Startup Journey dives deep into the tumultuous waters of oil and gas entrepreneurship. From birthing an idea to prototype development, the challenges are just beginning. How do you bring a new product to a colossal industry like oil and gas? We'll explore effective strategies to introduce innovations to the market, manage early customer interactions, and move from diligence to partnership. With insight on navigating engagements with behemoth clients like large independent and national oil companies, this conversation is packed with invaluable advice for turning a startup into a success. Stay tuned as we decode the complex journey of oil and gas startups right here on SPE Live. My name is Naeem Chowdhury and I am the Director of Integrated Climate Solutions at Honeywell. I will be your moderator today. On today's episode, we will also introduce you, our viewers, to the upcoming Startup Village Pitch Competition coming up at ATCE on September 24th, 2024 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Designed to ignite the entrepreneurial spirit in the energy industry, this competition showcases a remarkable gathering of emerging startups in the energy field. If you are or know someone who is part of a startup catering to the oil and gas industry, please consider being part of this competition. Today's SPE Live will last about 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guests. First off, we have Bryant Mueller, a Senior Vice President at DataGration. He has been an active volunteer with SPE for more than 25 years in roles such as Chairman of the Gulf Coast Section, Regional Director on the International Board of Directors, and is currently Chairman of the SPE ATCE Startup Village. Bryant earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Tulsa, where he serves on the Mechanical Engineering Industrial Advisory Board and is a member of the Athletic Hall of Fame. Our next guest, Ervil Boyd, is a financial professional for Devon Energy's Corporate Venture Capital Group. In this role, he serves two primary functions, learning the critical business challenges of the organization and connecting innovative solutions to Devon's subject matter experts. Their CVC Group has made three direct investments and is an LP in three venture capital funds. Through the funds, Devon has been able to pilot various technologies and software that aids their core business. Along with matching SMEs to relevant technology, Ervil also informs their investment committee on the progress of each investment through regular reporting. Our next guest is Josh Evans. Josh began his career as a consultant focused on electric transmission and distribution systems, where he led the development of over $2 billion in electrical and oil and gas infrastructure projects. Throughout his career, Josh has transitioned into commercial and operational roles and founded multiple businesses and organizations, including the Oklahoma City Pipelineers Club and a real estate development company, among other startup ventures. Josh is currently the founder, CEO, and chairman of High Volt Energy, a company which owns and operates electrical infrastructure to deliver power efficiently and responsibly in areas where electrical demand exceeds capacity. Bryant, Ervil, and Josh, welcome to this SBE Live. Thank you. Great to have you guys. I'd love to start off our segment with a little bit of a warm up, but very importantly, talking about getting in front of oil and gas customers. So let's start with Bryant. Bryant, many startups struggle to get their foot in the door of oil and gas companies. Based on your experience, who should these startups target and what's the best approach to get noticed? Thanks, Naim. Yeah, it's quite frustrating sometimes as a technology provider in our industry to get to the people who have the challenge you're trying to solve. We have to remind ourselves that they're usually busy working on the problem and challenged with time in the day to give themselves some time to even look for new technology and solutions. So I think our industry is probably whipsawed a little bit too far to the other side in using AI and chatbots and things to send out marketing material and technology, search engine optimization, etc. While that's important, nothing replaces good old fashioned networking and meeting people. My advice to any technology startup is you've got to get out there. You've got to meet people. There are technology buyers in the industry, subject matter experts who go to trade shows, go to industry events. They're seeking new ideas and new technologies, but they're not going to find them just through Google or in their email inbox. I would encourage any technology startup that while you probably have a very strong hypothesis of what your solution can do and you maybe even came directly from industry and said this is a problem I used to have, now I can solve it, go with some humility and be prepared to ask some questions face to face to learn what really are the challenges our customers face, how they buy and who the true buyer is, while also planning to establish your own credibility in a face to face setting that says I know what I'm talking about. I've done my homework. I know your company. I understand the industry, but I want to learn more and test the hypothesis that maybe I've developed a solution or technology that can solve problems for you, Mr. and Mrs. Buyer. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that, Brian. To follow up a little bit, maybe a question for Ervel. From an energy ventures perspective, what is the best way for oil and gas startups to get in front of the right people in your organization? Yeah, that's a great question. I echo a lot of what Brian said. First thing is to attend events like the Startup Village where you know that operators will be present. Second thing is to really participate in all the pitch competitions to really get your name out in front of the decision makers. When you attend both of those events, it's really great to network, but network with a purpose. So getting on LinkedIn, understanding and finding who those decision makers are is critical. To get to know them, to understand what the challenges are that they are facing. And then study the companies who you want to be a customer of yours in the future. Really understand what they're working in and what challenges they might be facing. That way when you do present your solution, it is clear, it is focused and it speaks the language of the operators. That's great. Makes a lot of sense. Let's move into the next challenge. Converting these initial discussions, as you guys have put together very well, into more of an implementation stage. Josh, maybe you can help me with this. How would you share how your company approached this particular topic? Sure. Thanks, Aimee. Converting the first deal when you have a new idea is one of the biggest challenges of a startup. You're basically asking someone to take a career risk by recommending your solution or your offering over just the status quo inside their company. In our case, we're asking companies to allow us to be their all-in-power solution. If we don't perform or if we don't deliver, those oil and gas companies lose all production capability and their losses in some cases can be orders of magnitude ahead of ours. I didn't put that backdrop there to say this is a really hard ask. We're asking them to trust us and not only trust us, but trust a startup organization or a newer company that doesn't have a track record of success. A big thing that we find is educating our customers is critical. We have to explain clearly and simply what we do. We have to listen to what they say as feedback. We've got tremendous opportunity to get input. People tell us if you could tweak this, if you could change this, it would make it easier. Then we adapt to what feedback they're giving us almost real time to make sure that the solution we're providing is something that they need. Then of course, executing on what we say we're going to do is critical. It builds trust and it just continues that relationship with the customer. Whenever we're looking at customers in general, there is a few things that you can do. You've got to cast a broad net. You'll find there's a lot of customers that have higher probabilities of saying yes. You have to be willing and able to identify those that have a need, a willingness to try new technologies. Then one of the most important things is finding an internal champion at that company that will be the guy that pushes or the guy or gal that will push for you and your solution. In all of this, you may be sure that you're moving quickly, you're able to identify and move on if something is heading towards a dead end. Eventually, you find those people that are willing to take the chance. They see you as value. You've educated them on your product and they're willing to go to bat, to their management to say yes to you. This is interesting. You talked about education. You talked about getting in front of the right person. You're talking about having the right solution identified to the right person. To follow that thread a little bit, Ervel, for you, could you add to that a little bit? How important from your perspective, from a CVC side, is it to have a well-structured proposal so you can evaluate and implement these ideas and even take that to the next level as Josh brought up? One of the big things that we try to do at Devon is to find that internal champion. That part is very important to, one, to get the buy-in and, two, just to have that leader on that new proposal. One thing that I try to tell our startups is to come with a well-structured but not perfect proposal. Sometimes perfect can be the enemy of progress. If the proposal is well-structured but maybe not exactly what an operator needs, it can still get part of the way there. That part can start to push that progress bar a lot further, a lot faster, and it opens time for iteration and for changes to be made. It's also important to just have a clear roadmap on how to get from initial pilot to full customer. Again, that doesn't have to be perfect, but having that laid out and continuing those discussions with the operator is very critical. Another part that's sometimes overlooked is the data that comes from the trial or the pilot. Having a way to document that, having a way to track that, and showing that in a clear, concise format to the executives of the operator is very important because maybe the solution solves half of what the operator needs, and that's going to be great. Having a way to document that and to show how the pilot is progressing is very important. Thanks for that great insight. We've covered that from the beginning. It's important to get in front of the right person. It's important to find the right companies as a startup to cater your technology towards. It's also important to really do some research and make sure that you are aligned with the people you're trying to get to invest or partner with you. Just looking outside of the standard, finding clients going in, maybe this one would be great for Bryant. Bryant, can you give some context on, since we're talking about SBE Startup Village, how can SBE Startup Village help these new technology owners bridge that gap between their products, their business models, expertise, and then maybe even potential investors or collaborators? Thanks, Naim. Many people may not be aware that the Society of Petroleum Engineers is putting so much effort and energy into encouraging startups and entrepreneurs. As our world increases its hunger for all types of energy to bring prosperity to all corners of the earth, our industry is striving to produce and be more efficient than we have in the past, increase profitability while increasing sustainability and, of course, safety. It might be daunting and a little bit scary for startups to believe that they can break into such a mature industry like oil and gas, but as we strive to help with improving the earth's energy needs, etc., I want to encourage everyone to believe me that there are technology buyers and investors out there that are trying to encourage startups and more entrepreneurs to take the gamble and take the risk, as Josh was talking about. There are methods for reducing this risk. We believe that our partnership with the Rice Alliance and putting on our Startup Village event at our industry's flagship event, the annual technical conference in September, is a way to encourage and teach startups and entrepreneurs how to get out of the gates and how to get off the ground and start going. Our pitch competition really does several things. It enables you to connect as a startup leader with industry leaders and potential investors. Our main goal is to connect you with other people who can help you get further down the road, but a key factor that we get feedback from every one of our competitors every year, probably their favorite piece of the Startup Village, is the coaching session we do before the pitch competition. We take the time to spend 45 minutes to an hour with every one of the startups in our competition and walk them through the competition itself, have them give a dry run of their pitch. They get industry leaders like people on this call to give them feedback on their market approach, their messaging, their financial models, etc., to do multiple things. One, to just strengthen them. As Ervel said, they don't come with a perfect solution. We actually have the opportunity to give some coaching and feedback. But then when they get live in the show, in the event itself, their brand is being put out there, they're increasing awareness of their solution, their technology, their name. They're getting to put the SPE logo next to their logo. And it really as an event is a great starting place for many of these startups. And it's a bit of an incubator. It gets things moving. And we've had great success. I think we're going on our seventh year or something like that. Applications open today for all of you startups out there to get into the competition. We are hosting it September 24th in New Orleans. We're very excited about this year. And we think that the momentum we've built over the last several years of doing this event and the feedback from the startups who have competed have taught us that this is a really great place for you as a startup to meet future buyers, future investors and increase your brand awareness. All makes sense. I'd love to get a first hand conversation going with Josh here. Josh, you're the CEO of a startup. You guys have been through a lot of these growing pains. I can't imagine. I can only imagine what the first few months, first few first few steps on your journey has been. Can you give me your insight on programs such as this that allow more kind of exposure to startups? Yes. I mean, the short answer is I wish I had known about SPStart at Millage when we were getting this started. Many of the things Brian said just about the wide offering, having all the resources available. And one of the key things I think, Brian, that you said is having the logo and some recognition or some exposure with backing of a well-known organization absolutely helps in pitching. You know, I find success is not an individual journey. Every successful company in history, whether they admit it or not, has had tremendous help along the way. My journey started with hours of connecting with other successful people with different skill sets and different experiences that filled the gap that I had in my career, things I didn't have exposure to or didn't understand how to think about. And it took hours and hours of just understanding a much broader audience and skill set to pull together a new company. They made introductions for me and reviewed models and listened to pitches, all the things Brian was saying earlier. So, you know, starting up a new company, you need capital, you need a network to even make introductions to oil and gas companies and get in the door. Multiple skill sets required. So organizations like SPStart at Millage offering all of these resources in one place, I think is an invaluable resource to tap into if you're thinking about starting up this journey. Well, Josh, before I go on with my next question for you again, I want to remind the audience that are watching this live, if you have any questions, no matter which platform you're looking at and watching this from, please go ahead, or if you're watching it live, please go ahead and ask your questions. We've got a few lined up. And Josh, since I have your attention, I wanted to kind of start with you. The question is, what's your advice for handling a conversation with a potential customer or investor that is having a very hard time believing the efficacy of your novel technology? Sure. Well, first off, I think it's important to accept you're going to hear more no's than yeses. It's really hard to get to those first yeses. And you need to be good at reading the room and understanding how you're spending your time and resources. What I find is there's really three different types of people, and you can expand that to companies. You have early adapters. You have the first to go second, which is what I like to call them. And then you have the do-it-myselfers or the not-evers. So it's important to find the early adapters and really focus your time and energy on those people, because that's where, I mean, just like Ervil said, how Devon tries to find and help some of these early adapters. You've got to find companies like that that are willing to try something new. On the first to go seconds, we run into a lot of those. It's like, hey, go prove it. Show me it works and show me there's no risk. And then I'm going to jump all over this. You want to keep those in your pocket because you're going to want to scale and grow your company. So find the early adapters, save the first to go seconds, and don't spend too much time getting bogged down trying to convince somebody that will never be convinced of your new technology, no matter how great it is. Resonating an earlier concept about just educating your customer is very important. I mean, education process and being able to relay your technology very simply is key. If you overcomplicate what you're trying to sell, nobody in the room is going to understand it, and it's going to be harder for them to take the chance of implementing. So even in really complicated solutions or structures, try to simplify and have a one or two or three line intro that very easily tells your audience, this is what we do, this is how it's going to help you, and this is how we implement. Use data. I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do to help prove that. I think several others have talked about de-multiplying data to prove the results. Erbil mentioned that earlier. And then I'm going to go back to that idea of champion. You know, when you're handling the hard conversations or somebody that is opposing to your technology, it's easier to get across that hurdle if you have somebody inside their organization working on your behalf. So if you've done a good job educating your champion, and then you run into a speed bump say with one of their managers or even one of their board members who have to approve your proposal, having that internal champion that understands your technology and can also easily explain helps you get through some of those hurdles. So there's no silver bullet, but certainly what I've outlined there I think helps with some of those difficult conversations. Now, this is great. Interesting question that just came through. I'm going to put my own spin on it. Erbil, this one's probably going to go for you. So a lot of times, as Josh mentioned, you've got to read the room. You've got to figure out who you're talking to. And as a startup, you've got to find the right audience. Although from looking at it from the other side, you as an investor sometimes are just not aligning yourself with what is being pitched to you. Right. So the question here is as an investor, how do you have that tough conversation of telling a startup that their business model just doesn't align with your corporation's investment methodology? Yeah, so that is a great question. And these conversations are always difficult because as a founder, all you want is for your product to work perfectly, to grow the top line and to have a profitable exit. But when it does not work out or if there's no traction within the organization that you're trying to sell into, the first thing that we do is we are very, very honest. We solicit feedback from our internal champions. We determine what went well, what did not go well, what was confusing, and what can be changed. We share that feedback with the founders, which is my favorite part because how and how a founder receives that feedback says a lot about their grit and their tenacity and their willingness to take that feedback in and iterate on their offering. And so after we give that feedback, we really try to articulate what our expectations are and we try to set those early if we can or after that initial feedback. Every trial will not be perfect and with the startup world, sometimes that is a difficult conversation to have internally. A lot of times SMEs think that if there is a new piece of technology, it's going to work, it's going to fit, and it's going to solve every challenge that they currently have. And so from our perspective, there's an educational piece where we try to say, you know, this might solve 10 to 40 percent of what your challenge is. Once that's done, let's give some feedback. Let's tell the founder where they need to iterate and then let's continue to push the wall forward. If it's not working, then it's a great, great time to tell the founder, hey, this is not a great fit for us for these one, two or three reasons. And then it's incumbent upon us to reach out in six to 12 months and learn if the founder has implemented that feedback and now perhaps it's a better fit for us. Or it may not be a great fit and we share that company though with our venture funds so that they can work with the founder. Lots of opportunities, lots of different conversations, but at the end of the day, it's sounding like we've kind of covered all of the top few directions and initiatives that startups need to take. In order to get in front of our CVCs or potential partners or technology partnerships or investors out there. We are getting close to the end of our time, but before I wrap up, I'd love to go around the table one more time and ask you each to share one or two key pieces of advice for startups aiming to penetrate the oil and gas market. Brian, let's start with you. Thank you, Naim. Beyond me encouraging you startups to apply to compete in the SPD Startup Village in the fall, I just reiterate, don't lean 100% on digital marketing, digital media, AI driven emails. Get out there and network with the purpose. As Ravel said, show tenacity, don't give up. Always be thinking, what did I learn from this and what will I do differently next time when I speak to a potential buyer? Thank you. Ravel, how about you? Yeah, so I said it earlier and I'll say it here. Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress. Show what you've got, share what you've got, get that feedback and just iterate and as Brian said, learn from every pitch competition, attend the SPD Startup Village and just work with folks and understand how you can make your company grow to what it needs to be. Fantastic. And from a startup's perspective, Josh? Yeah, sure. Entrepreneurship, I'd say, is one of the most rewarding things that you can do, but it's not for the faint at heart. It is a tough journey at times. I'd encourage everyone to do enough market research to objectively and honestly make sure the solution you're trying to bring to the table has a marketplace and if it doesn't, I mean, much to what Ravel was saying, be willing to pivot, be willing to change your solution to fit the market. Don't just try to keep doing the same thing. And then, you know, Ravel used grit and tenacity, I heard that from Brian as well. I use the word persevere. It almost always takes longer. We hear in this world so many things that seem to just fly to the moon with ease on startup and I don't think that's a typical experience. It does take a lot of perseverance and grit. It almost always takes longer than you expect and the path is harder than you expect. But if you have a great product and you're willing and prepared to withstand that journey, the tough early years really do pay off and it's a lot of fun. So, great organizations like this help you along the way, take advantage of everything you can. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Josh. Great comments. Well, we are at the end of our segment today. Thank you for all your questions and your comments and for joining us today. If you are part of a startup and you would like to know or know somebody that is part of a startup and would like to know more about the Startup Village Competition, please visit the website listed on the screen right now.

SPE Live Podcast: Plug and Abandonment ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Big Deal?,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the January 2024 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast, creating our energy future with SPE President Terry Palish and now your moderator, SPE Completions Technical Director, Karen Olson. Hello, I'm Karen Olson, SPE Completions Technical Director and President of Olson Turner Enterprises. I'm pleased to join 2024 President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast to talk about how SPE facilitates technical collaboration, particularly with respect to our technical sections. As a TD or a technical director, I see the tremendous importance of our technical sections and the collaboration opportunities they provide. Thank you for inviting me to join you, Terry, on this topic, and I hope you had a great holiday and a happy new year. Thanks, Karen. I want to just thank you, first of all, for being a part of the episode. Last month I had a great time speaking with Simeon when we reviewed the regional sections. When I started thinking about who should I have host the technical sections, I thought what better person than the current chair of the technical content committee on the board and current Completions Technical Director. Thanks so much for doing this. I know having been in your shoes as technical director, I know that the technical sections as an SPE connector and frankly all things technical fall under your purview. It's good to have you here today. As we get started, I really wanted to talk about technical sections because I think similar to regional sections, they're a key to fulfilling SPE's mission of connecting our members. Sometimes I don't know that everybody understands just what all is available, particularly when it comes to technical sections and the communities and the SPE Connect. I think it's important that they understand just that this is a big aspect of advancing the technical competence by collaborating and advancing technology as well as ultimately impacting their energy future. You're absolutely correct, Terry. Just like you, I've had the opportunity to be heavily involved with the technical sections and I now think they are as important as the regional sections. But for people who don't really know what technical sections are, maybe you can explain a little bit more about them. Sure. So, you know, technical sections got their start several years ago or many years ago, actually, when we had something we called TIGs. You probably remember them, technical interest groups. We used to check the box for how many of them we wanted to be involved in. The first technical sections actually were in 2006 and 2007, which is it's hard to believe they've been around that long. But the first two were well board positioning, a drilling one and R&D. And then in 2007, we actually our third one was CCUS, which I think is probably a bit of a surprise for a lot of people that we've had CCUS as a technical section for over 15 years. But in the end, most of them are they're technically focused. I mean, they're usually a subset of one of the technical disciplines, something that's specific like flow measurements or well board positioning, like I mentioned before, or another one like artificial lift and gas well deliquidification. But what's interesting is they're gaining popularity over just the last year. We've added five. We currently have 22, but we added five. We added data science and engineering analytics, methane emissions, hydrogen management. And this year in 2023, we added plug and abandonment. So the membership is definitely taking a liking to these. I think they're important. At last count, we had over 65,000 members signed up professionally. Members signed up professional members signed up for technical sections. So obviously you can be a part of more than one. So that's duplicating some people, but they are becoming very popular. And we just added students this last year. And so now we have over 2000 or excuse me, 10,000 student members. So as far as what they are, I think the easiest thing to think about is just think about your regional section. You know, so like you have a section leader chair, you have a program chair, you have a technical section chair, and they do collaboration and put on events. Well, a technical section is very similar. It's a technical, you're working a technical topic, but you're putting on events typically virtual because you're a global membership. So most of what you're going to do is going to be virtual, but you might do fundraising. You might have a scholarship. You might put on an in-person event like several months ago at ATCE. Technical sections meet. They make that their in-person meeting once a year. So, you know, that's how they that's what they are. So just think regional sections, but on a global basis, putting together a technical topic. Yeah, that is a good point to make is that these are global technical sections and that we are trying to reach the audience, you know, around the world. But I think another thing to point out is these aren't just classic or drilling or reservoir topics like you mentioned. You mentioned CCUS, but they cover all aspects that what our members want to talk about or have meetings around, correct? Yeah, that's right. So there's like I said before, there's 22 of them now. And certainly most of them would be what you said, you know, more classic petroleum engineering related, falling specifically in a discipline. But there are some that are related, but they're not exactly in a discipline. So things like management or R&D or say human factors. I mean, those are obviously critically important to our industry, but they're not a classic petroleum engineering. But then we also have begun to lean into some of the related energy technologies. So we've got, like I said before, an old one CCUS, but we have newer ones like geothermal, hydrogen, methane emissions. So, you know, it gives our members a chance to collaborate in their specialized topics, both petroleum engineering related and advance those technologies, but also it gives a place for our non-traditional subjects to have a place to reside and really expand our tent into the related energies. So I remember back in, I believe it was 2020 when you were the completionist technical director, Terry, I was leading the effort to start the hydraulic fracturing technical section. And of course, this was during COVID. And there was a group of us that were really wanting to collaborate and pull everybody together in our discipline and especially when we're all sort of just stuck at home. And it was with your sponsorship that we were able to launch and form this hydraulic fracturing technical section. So how are new technical sections created or formed? Well, it's really not very difficult. As you know, it takes a little bit of work and some effort. But you first start with an outline for the purpose or the objectives for this section or this group. So essentially, it's a mission statement. So what is it you want to discuss and what is your technical focus? You obviously need a committed leadership. It probably takes a little bit more effort because since you're a global section, you're going to not be all sitting in the same region or city. So it does take some coordination, some commitment. So you'll need a list of your proposed members and your section leadership. Excuse me. You also need a governance model. So in other words, how are you going to elect your leadership positions? What is the criteria for membership? Things like that. And then the last thing, which is probably the most important for a lot of reasons, and that is you need sponsorship of a technical director. So all of these fall under one of the technical directors. That technical director will do a couple of things. First of all, he or she will help you with the process. So there is a template and so it helps you. I kind of helped you through the process. We kind of learned it together, actually. But the other thing is then the technical director will kind of make sure there's not overlap with another technical section, things like that. And then maybe most important is to make sure that this has broad appeal. You may remember with the hydraulic fracturing, you guys were, I mean, for what you were doing, you were pretty focused on North America. And we kind of discussed it and we said, well, can we kind of expand that tent a little bit? And so like today, obviously, you've got board members that are, excuse me, you've got leaders on the technical section that are span the entire globe and you broadcast across the entire globe. So it's not too difficult, but again, with the help of a technical director, they'll help you through that. Right. Yeah. We sort of started off, like you said, North America centric. And with your help, we broadened it and we have leaders on the technical section group. The current chair is actually based in the UK. And we now have quarterly international webinars as well as monthly webinars. And I believe they're also looking for liaisons now around the world too. So, you know, you continue, these technical sections continue to grow. Once you form them, they just keep growing in size and what we're doing in them. So those are technical sections. What about the SPE Connect? What is that and how does that sort of fit in with the technical sections? So as I mentioned kind of before, if you think about back, we had these technical interest groups and about the same time we were forming the technical sections, these technical interest groups were going on and what those were, were online forums. They didn't put on advance or anything like that, but it was just a discussion place, a place where you could discuss topics. So at the same time we're establishing the technical sections, there was also kind of an upgrade in kind of just that collaboration software. And so SPE developed what we now call SPE Connect. And it's really what it sounds like. SPE Connect is the way that we connect everybody and connect our membership. And so SPE Connect is now taking the place of the TIGs. But from a technical section standpoint, SPE Connect is now, they go hand in hand. So that is now the place where as a technical section, you have a site there and you have, first of all, that's where you communicate with your members of your technical section, but it's also the place where you have your discussion threats. So people can ask questions about some technology or a problem they're having or whatever. And it ends up being a discussion thread. So that's all happening on SPE Connect. The other thing on SPE Connect is that you have your online profile. You also have access to the eight technical communities. So those are disciplines, so like drilling or completions or whatever. And then there's also 10 non-technical communities. Non-technical communities are things like the young professionals or the members in transition or the volunteer portal or D&I. So there's also communities associated with those, I'll call them disciplines, but those communities as well. So again, SPE Connect is kind of exactly what it sounds like. It's the members' ability to connect with each other. And it has basically everything all in one place. So maybe just to ask, expanding on that, Terry, under the SPE Connect, the technical sections have their sites or their websites that people can go in and find the website, say for the hydraulic fracturing technical section or the CCUS, and find out what's going on under those technical sections, right? That's right. They can find that out. They can also, like your completions, there's a link to your completions technical director site as well. So it's basically one place that you can go to find all your connections. And like I said before, it's also where you connect with members. So the membership directory is located there. You have your online profile and things like that. So it seems like it's sort of the focal point. If you want to find any information, that's where you need to go is the SPE Connect. So would you say, why is SPE Connect and our technical sections critical? To SPE fulfilling our missions or its missions? Well, yeah. So, you know, again, I think it's similar to the regional sections. You know, I see this as another cornerstone of fulfilling the mission. Remember our mission, and I've said this multiple times, but our mission is connecting our members to technology, connecting our members to other members, and connecting our members to external stakeholders. And I think the easiest way to see kind of how this all fits together is maybe we could just take some examples of some of the technical sections. So let's just take your hydraulic fracturing technical section, which, by the way, is an award-winning technical section. Like you said before, they hold monthly webinars. Now you have a quarterly international one. So it allows you for some networking and technical dissemination. I think sometimes you guys have held breakout sessions so you can dive deeper into the subject or perhaps network a little bit more. I know you guys, I think, just started Outstanding Graduate Student Award. I think you're going to give your first awards at ATC, or excuse me, HFTC in February. So that's pretty neat. And then, of course, you put out you put on networking reception at HFTC. I know you've interviewed the legends and things like that. So, I mean, that's your that's you can see all aspects there. If we go to say the drilling systems automation, so DSATS, that's a drilling technical section. They're actually one of the more established again. So they actually have six subcommittees. I mean, these subcommittees range in all kinds of topics, things like open source drilling, data quality, things like that. It also has one of my favorite student programs, which is Drillbotics. And for those who don't know what Drillbotics is, Drillbotics is basically an international drilling design competition that basically promotes multidisciplinary approach to solving a drilling challenge. And it's super cool. It's really a neat program. But that's all basically put on by DSATS. And maybe the last one I'll highlight is the sustainability development, sustainable development technical section. So that's SDTS. And, you know, they've been around since 2010 doing multiple programs. But probably one of their most recent initiatives that most people will know about is the GAIA program. They established the GAIA program, they now host that. And they essentially had the first GAIA summit in 2021. That's an annual event. The next one's in March in Muscat, or April in 2024. So they basically now support all GAIA programming across all the SPE programs, including GAIA Talks. So, like I said, so if you think about the connecting part of it, the technical sections connect the members to the technology in that technical section. It also connects them to each other by networking, but also brings in our external stakeholders, whether it's energy related or the students or things like that. So really all in one place, it really takes care of our mission as a whole. That's great. That's great. So how can members then, young, senior, get the most out of these technical sections and SPE Connect? What should we be doing as a member of SPE? Yeah, that's a great question, Karen. So first thing I'll say is, you know, go into SPE Connect, go into the technical section website, and look at the list of technical sections. Again, you can join as many as you want. I mean, I would, you could do it. I wouldn't, I would guard against joining them all, but maybe shoot for like two to four, you know, the ones that maybe are of interest to your specific work, but maybe, maybe there's a couple in there that you want to stay on top of. That's kind of the way I do it. Then the next thing I'd say is go into, you know, as you're in SPE Connect, look at your profile, update your profile. You can put all kinds of information in there for yourself so that, so that that's in your member directory. But then also check out the technical communities I talked about. So you can join more than one technical community. Like I'm a part of the drilling, completion, and the production technical community. Also look at the non-technical communities. Those are going to be ways that you can stay abreast of some of the non-technical discussions. For frame of reference, I'm a member of three technical communities, three technical sections, and four non-technical communities. One of them, I think it's really important on the non-technical is a volunteer portal. So sign up for the volunteer portal. Then you'll get notifications on volunteer opportunities. So, you know, again, I think the important thing is to look at SPE Connect as kind of this one stop for connecting. So it gives you a chance to establish your online profile. It gives you a chance to engage with your colleagues. It gives you a chance to join technical and non-technical conversations. You can send in questions that you have. You can help people answer them. That's also, by the way, where you're going to set up your preferences. So you can tell SPE how often you want to get notifications, whether you want to get them every day, every week, things like that. So you can manage your email a little bit. But then, obviously, once you do that, then participate. I want to also point out students can now join technical sections. That's something new within the last year. So as a student, take advantage of that. You can observe what's going on in the technical threads. You asked about YPs. I mean, if you're a young professional, the way I'd look at it is I would join these and I would observe. I would probably ask questions about maybe there's some technical topics you need to understand better. And if you're a seasoned professional, I would encourage you to help mentor now, help people answer questions, help them with whatever the challenges they're having. You know, the challenge we face are going to be many and going to be in order to meet those, we're going to have to engage in lifelong learning, but we're going to have to collaborate. And I think if we can collaborate and work together to advancing technologies, it'll help advance not only our professional development, but it'll help us create our energy future. Yeah, absolutely. Those are just great advice, Terry, for everyone to take to heart. I'm quite honestly, I'm ready to go back and look into SB Connect and see what I've signed up for and make sure I'm on that volunteer portal myself as one of them for sure. Terry, it's been great to talk to you today and I hope to see you at the hydraulic fracturing conference that's coming up here in February. So what are your plans to talk about in your next month's podcast? Well, first of all, let me just make a quick reminder out there. So the calls for paper proposals is now currently open for ATCE 2024. That'll be open, I think, through the end of the month, the end of January. So if you want to present a paper at the 100th anniversary of ATCE in New Orleans next year, it's time to get your abstract in. And then I guess speaking of papers, that's actually what we're going to talk about next month. I mean, I think it's one of the key ways, it is one of the key ways that SP disseminates technical information. So we'll talk about papers, probably touch on one petro, the journals and everything that kind of is associated with that. So that's what we'll be talking about. And I look forward to seeing you at HFTC as well. And Karen, look, I just want to take one more opportunity to thank you for being a part of the podcast. This has been great. But I also want to thank you not only for your service on the board, but also, you know, your involvement with getting HFTS started and everything you're doing. And, you know, I think you're a great example of someone who's creating their energy future. So thank you so much. Well, thank you, Terry. It has been great talking to you today. Take care. We hope you've enjoyed this edition of the SPE Presidents Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
SPE Live Podcast: Gaia Talk: Biodiversity - Perspectives on Current Issues and Challenges,"Talking to us today about the direction of technology development in oil and gas technology is Barbara Berger, who's the head of Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the industry's oldest venture groups that invest in startups and a lot of the new technologies that you've been reading about over the years in JPT. With that, I want to welcome Barbara. Thank you for coming in today. Well, thanks for having me. This is an extraordinary time in the industry. It's not just a crash, but we're also living through a pandemic. The mantra five years ago was lower for longer, and it feels like it's back again. As we think about the startup ecosystem and where a lot of new technologies come from, how are today's events going to shape the next few years to come? Yeah, so great question. First of all, hope that you and your family and all our audience are staying safe throughout all of this. When we think about the startup ecosystem, I think it's vibrant, it's needed, and they're trying to address really important problems. For each startup, the story is a little bit different, just like for each company and for each individual. We have a portfolio of companies that we've amassed over, we've been in existence for 21 years. Each company had to, first of all, assess their own situation, assess their employees, assess their operations, and then really understand the impact of COVID, of the market conditions on their business plan, and do some self-help, look to their investors for whether or not they're going to support them through that, and make the direction-changing actions that they needed to. Most of our startups, this has not been a positive message. They've done a really good job, but most of them, COVID and market conditions have made it tougher. But that's not the case for all of them. There have been opportunities in all of this. So good opportunities come for startups, whether the market is tough or whether you have tailwinds. So we're there to support them. And when you say lower for longer, that's just one more challenge we've got. So we need innovation, innovation directed at how can you succeed in those market environments. So obviously, it's very tough for the startup world, but for a VC, does this actually, in a way, make your job a little bit easier in terms of narrowing the scope on what you're willing to take risk on investing in? And if we look at this through specific lenses, can you speak to me about the different buckets that compete for your investment dollar, production technologies versus software? Right. No, good question. So first of all, our first focus was on shoring up our current portfolio. And I kind of went through the steps that those companies have. But we also have dry powder, as the industry would call it, for new investments. And there's a lot of opportunities out there. The problem set is maybe a little bit different. You talked about lower for longer. And so we're looking for technologies that can lower cost, increase cycle time, lower emissions, all of those problem sets. I think a couple of things that have happened in this is, one is some valuations came down. So that's always good as an investor, particularly a new investor. Most investors are staying the course, but there are some that have flown. So that gives us opportunities. We're having to do due diligence and having to do our early engagement with startups in a different way. We always want to go and see them, kind of see what's there, kick the tires, meet the team. And we're having to do that virtually. There's some positives to that, in that you can get a lot more introductory meetings done and engage. And I think the velocity is increasing. But we're having to change some of our processes in terms of how to do that. That's an interesting point. I was actually talking to a startup founder recently who said the same exact thing in one of their early fundraising series and saying that we love to get intimate with potential investors, but we're actually able to finish the job a lot quicker according to everybody because we're doing it remotely. Just as an aside, I'm curious, is that because the startup world and the VC world, it's a very close-knit community. Almost everybody knows each other. And you guys go to a lot of the same events together and see each other all the time. So is this distance, work from home, remote conferencing, is that something that might actually stick around in this ecosystem? Or are you guys going to try to revert back to the mean and get face-to-face more often? I think it's an interesting one that's going to play out. And hopefully, all of us are not thinking back to when is it going to get back to normal, but we're envisioning the new normal. So I think some of it is we're adopting or developing practices that we will continue on. Even this kind of engagement, it's been a lot easier for me, the notion that I'm just going to be sitting in my study and do this rather than carve out time to physically go to a place. Now, the disadvantage is I don't get to see the audience, so that's not good. But I think the piece that we've got all kinds of technologies for networking and stuff, and a lot of the organizations are trying interesting things so you can pop into a table and have a small intimate conversation and so forth. But I think we've got to figure out how to do physical events in the future sensibly and responsibly and maybe even hybrid events. And I know there's a few trials and pilots that are going to be contemplated this fall here in Houston about, so how do we bring together the investors and the startups so that we can have some of that but still do it in a responsible way? I don't think we've all figured out how to do that yet. Yeah, I was going to say, I think that's a fair answer considering here at the SBE, we're going through all of those same challenges ourselves. But I wanted to also ask you about some of the themes that we've been seeing in the technology space over the last few years. And one of them is big companies like Chevron trying to embrace external technologies and find where they can fit in oil and gas. And the other circles back to startups and how in a B2B world big clients need to help foster those small young companies and give them not just the financial runway but the actual practical experience to grow and especially in such a risk-inverse business. So if you look back on just what we've seen since the last downturn 2015 to now, what grade would you give the industry on being able to work those two fronts? So am I giving a grade for effort or results? Well, you tell me, give me one for each. How have we done on external technology adoption and how well has the business really fostered this startup ecosystem and are there any shining examples of either? Yeah, so good. So I would give us, I'm a tough grader, but I'd probably give us an A minus B plus on effort. I think the doors are opening. I think company and in a time of change, I think companies look for, they become much more open in terms of what are the capabilities and what are the approaches to change. When times are good, that's actually when it's hardest to get new things adopted. Okay, so I think effort A minus to B plus, in terms of results, I think time will tell. So probably it's more like a B minus B with upward arrow. I think the opportunity in Houston, I don't know how many of your audiences from Houston, but I think one of the things that Houston can distinguish itself relative to the startup ecosystem is this connection with the corporates. There is a very high concentration of corporates here and corporates bring experience and understanding of the problems, experience and scale, and ultimately they bring their supplier dollars. And so if you can get the little guys and the big guys to work together, I think that really is a good recipe for success. I think the other thing is the small guys have gotten smart and some of the small guys are not so small anymore, but they've gotten smart and they've hired people from the industry. So they have domain knowledge, they know what the problem sets are, and they get credibility into the corporations. I think that's one thing Silicon Valley has even gotten, I think they've read that playbook and they've hired people from our industry to be able to help better define the problems and thus the solutions, particularly in software innovation. Yeah, early on that was a huge cause of divide was, do you have domain expertise, do you not? And it seems like over the years we have seen more companies, especially on the coast, hire talent from this business to sort of help make that translation easier.

But let me ask you about another sort of age old, you know, VC startup, operator problem, which is, you know, you can throw all the money you want at a new technology company, but if you can't get it to work in the Permian Basin, for instance, then it might die on the vine. And so, you know, how have you, what is your philosophy? What are the things you've learned about connecting what happens at HQ and the VC group to the wellhead? Yeah, no, it's a really good question. And there's a little bit of our secret sauce there, but I'll tell you a bit about it because you're right, just investing in companies is a necessary part of it, but it's not sufficient. And, you know, we learned that we had to take it through to what we would call use. So we needed to collaborate with our business units and our functions to really ask the questions, does the thing work? And will it add value to Chevron? Because it could work, but it doesn't really add any value because it doesn't either take costs away or produce more, or it's just one more layer that we put on of protection and control. And so, you know, we've worked on that over time and have, you know, fair amount of success. It's still, you know, it's not a slam dunk, but you have to do that. And also, the startups need that feedback. So what, you know, sure they want investment dollars, sure they want revenue, but they also want to know, does this thing work before I go and scale it up? And what kind of feedback do I get? So we kind of try to deliver the whole experience because that's ultimately what's going to have the biggest impact on Chevron. How often do you tell me is it that your team falls in love with a technology or a startup, and then you try to take it to the field and vet it against, you know, who would be the end users, and they actually come back and surprise you and say, you know, no, this won't work. Is that a regular occurrence or, you know, how often does that happen? Yeah. So there's a lot in there. So first of all, don't fall in love with the solution, fall in love with the problem. And we try to guard against that. And we try to guard against it. Even upfront, you bring me a solution, I'm going to say what's around it, what's the landscape, who are their competitors, all that stuff. Sometimes we even do a bake off where we might trial yours versus the incumbent or yours versus the other folks that are there just, you know, because we want to, you know, we want to pick the winner. You know, innovation, you know, people think it's all about technology. It's about people. It's about your willingness to try new things. We've got a number of different practices to try to collaborate. It is about collaboration. We've had some success in the organization across all the streams. And so we've got some credibility that when we bring something to you that, you know, we think it's going to work and we're willing to work with you on a trial, you know, that says something in the business. We also hire from our businesses. So we hire people that have experience in a refinery, out on a platform, in the oil field. And again, that's all building up the broader team that looks at these technologies. You know, if we're sticking to sort of these interesting startup and DC themes, you know, one of the ones that I enjoy debating with people the most or talking about the most with people is buy versus build. And this really comes, you know, centers around software investments and how big operators look at software solutions. And, you know, I know that there's a lot of sort of, it depends on trying to answer this question, but how do you reconcile the buy versus build conundrum? Yeah, so, and I think buy versus build sounds so binary. And it's actually, as we go along, there's more and more different pieces. You know, it does depend, but you told me you weren't going to accept that as an answer. You know, the reality is, is it something where we can have a competitive advantage? Or is it something where the pace of innovation externally is going to be so much faster? And I think we're evolving as a company and our comfort level in working with, whether it be a startup or, you know, one of the big tech companies in terms of, you know, where is going to be our competitive advantage? Is it the development or is it the application? So, I do think it does depend and it's ever evolving. And if you looked at our portfolio, you would see things from startups, you would see things from our tech partners, you would see things from the oil field service partners, and you would see things that we have developed ourselves. So, I think that's the answer is to look at each area and be able to have the facility to succeed with all those different tools. You know, sometimes I wonder if we're even asking the right questions all the time. And as I hear you talk about buy versus build, it's really, I think it goes back to something you said, you know, fall in love with the problem. And it was, you know, here it goes, which kind of challenges are you looking at for startups to solve? So, as specific as you can be, you know, what are the innovations that you're looking at for oil and gas? A couple of things, you know, on the subsurface, it's obviously being able to know more about the reservoir and your drilling operations. And it's, you know, it's better data, cheaper and more reliable. On the surface, a lot of it is around asset integrity. Again, there's a lot of digital plays relative to the surface as well. But let me also talk about, and this cuts across into the energy transition, which we have been investing in companies that play in this space for quite some time. But in 2018, we launched a future energy fund to really concentrate in this area. And so, it's, you know, how do you use less energy? So, it's energy efficiency technologies. It's when you do produce CO2, how do you, you know, either capture it, capture it and store it or capture and use it? How do you ensure that methane emissions are reduced, they're detected, reduced or mitigated? So, those are all things within oil and gas that are part of the equation. Obviously, it's production, it's cost. We're talking about lower for longer, so we got to do that. It's reliability, but it's also a low carbon footprint. You know, since you've talked about, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into your future energy fund. So, this launched two years ago. It's $100 million. Can you talk about, you know, any of the investments you've made so far? And with regards to those buckets that you just outlined, you know, are you looking, how much more are you looking at carbon sequestration and reuse versus emissions mitigation? Yeah, so the future energy fund initial $100 million. And we've made, I think, nine investments so far. And they run the gamut in really two large buckets to start with. One is lowering the emissions of oil and gas. And I talked about that area. And the other is low carbon value change. So, we know that the energy mix is going to be more diverse as we go forward. And by 2040, all, you know, most estimates are 50% of total primary energy demand is going to be oil and gas. That means 50% is not. And the system is going to be an integration of all of that. So, we also are placing bets in non-oil and gas. You know, I think there's, in that area are a few things that I'll talk about. One is just different sources of generation. You know, clean heat is a problem that, you know, if your innovators out there want to think about it, you know, hydrocarbons are used in a lot of heating applications. So, what can you do to lower the emissions in thermal processes? You know, carbon capture, use and storage, we focus mainly on the capture. It's a very costly part of the process. But utilization, so, rather than just storing CO2 in the ground, you know, what can you use it for? Sort of the circular economy. Hydrogen, so, can you either make hydrogen cheaper or lower the emissions? Then there's this whole area around mobility because transportation and oil are so much tied together. But as mobility goes, where's the innovation there? And then the power value chain is getting more decentralized. It's using different sources. And there's a huge part of software integration there. So, we've got investments in all of those. Some of them have a direct linkage currently into Chevron's operations. And so, we're working on, you know, trialing and so forth. And some have no linkage with the current. But we see them as important in the energy system of the future. And we want to make sure we understand, you know, what it takes to be successful and make sure Chevron is positioned to be able to capitalize on them.

This sort of gets to the persona of Chevron Technology Ventures. And, you know, the question is, you know, if you're looking at a seed round, a series A, B, C, you know, so these are obviously stages of fundraising and maturity. Where's the sweet spot for Chevron? Where do you guys like to come in on the startup? Good question. So, our first question is, you know, so our sweet spot for investments typically is an A and B. And that's where we feel like we can influence and where you need support. We do have a pre-series A milestone-based grant tool that we use when we see something that's not RSA, but we'd like to get a little closer to it, you know, get a little closer to the technology, but also the people. So, A and B. And obviously, as the company matures and grows, then, you know, we go along with them if, you know, we still see a good positive trajectory for the company. And I have another one that's coming from the startup point of view here. You know, what are the best practices that you would recommend to startup companies who are, you know, dying to get their first field test? You know, so they've done everything except for, you know, get into a well or get access to production data. You know, what are some of those things that will help them, you know, cross that chasm? Yeah, so that's, it's a really good question. And it's, and a lot of times a startup doesn't know where to go in a company. And that's one of the reasons that we have developed the capability within Tech Ventures, so that when we're looking at you, we're not just looking at you as a company, and are you investable, and what's the circle of co-investors around you, but also, so how might this go, you know, get into Chevron? So, you know, some of it is getting introduced to the team members that I have, whether it's in a local event, or we're going to need to do something virtually, and we get comfortable with the company, we get comfortable with what you've got, we understand the problem you're working on, and then, you know, if we see something we like, then, and, you know, we do all the landscape work, we understand the problem set, we think that, we think it solves a problem that Chevron has prioritized, then we would work with the startup, and with the business unit, and other experts in the company, to in fact design the trial. We can't help you if we don't set it up that way. Let me ask you another general question about, you know, a big topic, general trans-, digital transformation, and this is sort of, I'm going to ask you another, sort of like a grade here, but, you know, what phase, what inning are we in as an industry, and where are we seeing the most impacts? You know, we speak so often to generalities about this topic, I'd really love, like, what segment of the upstream business is being most impacted positively by digital investments? So, I think across all of the major functions in upstream, and even in downstream, but what I would say is that we're probably in the early innings from, you know, a number of the things that we've actually gone through to implementation have been more transactional, which is, I think that's where you start, and I think the transformational capabilities are being identified, but it's not, you know, it's not overnight that you can actually implement them, and implement them at scale, but I think that's the next inning, and then you just start to see, I mean, the rewards for all of what you've done, because the digital capabilities aren't just so you can do the current workflow cheaper and faster, it's that you get new workflows, and those are transformational by definition. They're very disruptive, and so they take some time, because they do cut across functions at that point. You know, how current circumstances influence the speed of the trajectory when we talk about, you know, making digital investments, like actually putting cash on the table, and as well as, you know, adopting these things into our workflows and processes, you know, we're facing an industry that's contracting again, you know, sadly, lots of jobs are being lost, lots of people in the field and in HQ, so what does that do to this drive towards digital? Yeah, I mean, it's a tough year, and I, you know, I feel it as a leader of an organization, I feel it as an investor, you know, I feel it a bit as an employee, you know, it's not an easy time. I think that the progress or the pace depends. When you, you know, one of your audience members asked about getting things down whole, so trials and hardware trials and things like that have gotten harder in the short term. Things that can provide a very clear picture of the benefits and things that are more sophomore oriented and stuff, I think those have maintained their pace, maybe some of them have been accelerated. The big transformational ones, we as a company and as an industry, you know, we're going to be very focused because you can't take them all on in a time when the, you know, when the market conditions are tough. So, you know, I think we're having to prioritize more, which means that by definition, some folks don't make the list. Barbara, I probably have time for one or two more questions with you, but this is one that I wanted to throw at you from sort of my personal experience. I sat through a lot of Shark Tank events and a lot of gatherings of startups, and it's been evident to me in my reporting and from what I've seen, is that there's been, you know, in addition to sort of a heavy interest in software, there's also been a lot of investment interest in onshore, specifically North American shale technologies versus say a deep water oriented technology. As the market is now in a little bit of flux, to put it lightly, do you think that the investment community at large will change the scales there of how much interest goes to onshore technologies versus something that's a little bit more smaller scale but possibly higher impact in deep water? And tell me if you disagree with my judgment, you know, in the first place. I mean, I think that, and hopefully this will be a general answer, that it'll scratch that it. I think you got to look at the investor pool and say who's going to be investing in that, in those technologies. They typically are corporates. Strategic investors have had a fairly high percentage of the investment, and how many of them are going to invest in core oil and gas versus the energy transition versus digital? And, you know, I think the, you know, the dollars are getting diluted a little bit. And so there's, you know, we continue to invest across all of that, but even some of our peer companies are not investing in oil and gas innovation other than digital. And so that does put, it puts some stress on hardware innovation and the number of investors that are really looking at that. I didn't do the offshore, onshore, but it's a bigger theme of, you know, who are the investors and, you know, what is the role of the corporates and what is the role of oil field service going forward? Because very early on in those companies' lives, you know, they need support from the industry or investment in the industry, and I think it's getting diluted. Well, while I have you, I'm going to get you on one last question because I think it's a really, really good question. And geographically, countries or continent, where do you see the innovation concentration? So, you know, has this, has it changed? Is it, are things coming from, you know, the Houston area more or less often? Are you going overseas to look at technologies? How has that shifted? So, you know, a plug for Houston is they're increasing here because, you know, we didn't have a lot in our portfolio here, but, you know, we will invest from almost anywhere. And we had a lot of concentration in Norway and, you know, the UK and Scotland. I think we're seeing more from the continent, from Israel, all over the US. And actually, that is, I think, a trend that I think is good is that we're seeing innovation, not just from the two coasts, but in the center and in lots of places in the center. As an investor and as a user of innovation, the more the merrier, right? So, it's a volume game for us, but we'll take that challenge. Well, Barbara, you know, I really thank you for sharing your insights and letting us, you know, get sort of an insider's view on what happens at CTV. And I think we're going to be at CTV. And we wish you the best of luck and I will bid you farewell. All right. Thank you very much."
SPE Live Podcast: Natural Language Processing in the Subsurface & Wells Disciplines,"I'm Jason Otouris and this is SPE Talks to Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SPE podcast. This month doing things a little differently. We are remote. I'm set up in a small space in my house. Shana, we have you on the phone. Thank you so much for taking the time to join us. Oh, thank you. Your April column is dedicated to technology evaluation. It's an area that you've spent a majority of your career and I do want to get into that a moment but first I just have to ask, how are you? Well, doing as well as can be expected under these conditions. I have been working from home since March 12th. I have a daughter who's a senior in high school who's pretty bummed about having a lot of her final year fun activities canceled and being stuck in a home with her mother. And then again, I got two dogs that are extremely happy that they get to walk all the time. So we're doing as best as we can. We're staying safe and that's the priority here. Before we get into April's column, I wanted to give a quick reminder that SPE has an app. You can get access to OnePetro, the latest technical content from SPE publications. I've got the app on my smartphone. It's a great way to stay connected while we're all living in this new normal right now. It's easy to access, easy to use. It's available both in the App Store and Google Play. Just search SPE International and download today. Welcome back. We're with 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan. And while we are recording this podcast episode in April, many reference points in the column that you wrote actually came from mid-February and that's before the whole pandemic declaration and work from home mandates came into place. Still, much of this is very applicable to our current conditions because we are being asked in many cases to embrace technology evaluation and to be more strategic in this arena. I agree, Jason. The column is still very much relevant, but as we go through, I'll just do some update or caveat to our current situation. And again, a lot of people don't realize that when the presidents write their columns, we're having to submit them six to eight weeks in advance because of the print version of JPP meeting the deadlines with the printers and with shipping. So this topic was very much on my mind in February. But who knew what was going to be occurring in the month ahead. But again, I'm still very excited about this topic because it's something I'm extremely passionate about. And you've already mentioned that I've done a good part of my career in technology evaluation. And so it's important as we're dealing with the economic and pandemic situation right now, that we can still, what we still can and should not lose focus on the technical advancement. And I really like how you do break down the technology evaluation because you set it up by asking yourself two questions. Let's go ahead and discuss that. The subject of my column is a compilation of the last several decades of my career, not only doing technology evaluations, but also dealing with weekly phone calls by young engineers or inventors who have discovered the next best thing, the silver bullet, something that's going to revolutionize our industry. And over time, I tend to ask two questions right off the bat. One is, do I or do you even need this new technology? And do you understand the root cause of your issue enough to determine if applying existing technology and excessive practices cannot solve it? And to be honest, probably about 90% of the time, the root cause can be solved just by applying existing technology in the right way. And I don't mean to be critical. I've always been critical for innovation. I've always been a champion for innovation and technology development. But when you can already solve it cheaply by just applying the fundamentals in a correct way, a lot of time a new tool or method is not even needed. And I do like that because those are two questions that are, at the root of it, simple for the most part. They can be asked across disciplines, across industries even. One, do I need this new technology? And two, do I understand the root cause of the problem well enough to determine if applying existing technology and accepted practices cannot solve it? So there's where we're starting. But for context, go ahead and provide me an example. Okay. Well, being an artificial list engineer, most of my examples do come from the artificial list side, but again, they're relevant across most disciplines. So let's start with the example that I gave in my column with the down-hole rod reciprocating pump. And by the way, this type of pump is called two different ways in the industry. It's been referred to as a rod pump and a beam pump. And just a side note, the term beam pump is pretty much a pet peeve of mine because the beam refers to the surface unit, which is a walking beam. But your down-hole pump may not be driven by a beam unit. So calling that down-hole pump a beam pump is kind of like nails on a chalkboard to me. But anyway, I digress. So rod pump technology has been around for over a century. And for pretty much most of that time, the design practices for determining the optimal tolerance between the down-hole plunger and barrel were basically just a bunch of theoretical equations and a lot of used rules of thumb. It got to be a point where some of the people in the industry couldn't even remember where those rules of thumb came from, which is not a good sign. But basically, if that opening, that tolerance was too large, it was thought that there'd be a lot of fluid slippage and then you'd have really poor efficiency of the pump. And then going the other way, if it was going to be too tight of a tolerance, the thought was it would lead to a lot of rod buckling and inability to handle particulates such as sand. And scale was also an issue too. So as an industry, we typically erred on the side of caution towards going higher tolerances because, oh no, we couldn't have poor pump efficiency. And so what happened was a lot of gadgets and accessories were developed to counter the issues caused by a really tight design philosophy. But it wasn't until the late 1990s when a group of operators in the Permian Basin really began to question these equations and these rules of thumb and really quantify is are we concerned about something that's really not there? But keep in mind, this was also at a time now where instrumentation could be accurate and the sample size at a fast enough rate that we could actually start doing experiments and actually quantifying this. And so this was the case of the consortium doing this research at Texas Tech to really understand the dynamics of the fluid slippage between the plunger and barrel. And they did it under a variety of conditions, fluid viscosity with gas. And over time, they were able to develop a new equation, which was later named the Patterson equation after my mentor, John Patterson. And they proved that the largest tolerances didn't lead to all this slippage that people had been thinking they'd been avoiding for years. And this understanding created a huge wave of positive impact in the industry once they published this information. Because now the problems that had incurred due to the tighter tolerances, now that we open them up, the pump could handle sand better. We didn't have a lot of rod failures collectively just by doing this one simple design process from now understanding the fundamentals. It is hugely increased rod pump run lives globally. Collaborations, spending a bit of time and some money doing some research. What they gained in improved run lives was well, well beyond their initial investment. And it sounds like, too, one of the great benefactors of this is the fact that it was just publicized. So globally, it did have an impact. Yes. And again, I'm an artificial lift engineer, so I can cite many examples. I spent seven years of my career doing validation testing of high-temp electric submersible pump equipment. And the learning that we had from that, again, far outweighed the benefits that we saw once we applied. And several of my papers were on that testing. There's a reference in my column to an article that Robin Beckworth wrote for JTT in 2014 that gives the entire history of artificial lift. If that's something that you're interested in reading, I highly recommend it. It's a really good background in chronology to my discipline. But anyway, on the GAP website, for those senior members like myself who remember the days of the SBE handbook. It was a giant book that was considered the Bible, and it was your reference to anything to do in our industry. And the GAP lift chapter on that had what was called the universal GAP lift design, where you follow this design methodology using the classic Thornhill-Craver equation. This GAP lift design would work in any well and unload to bottom. Well, the problem was, again, that was based off of theoretical equations. And another consortium that got started in the 1990s, it was the Valvol Form is Clearing House. And what they did was really try and understand the fundamentals of flow through a GAP lift not an orifice, but an actual live out. And what they came up with was unique equations per GAP lift model, size, and type that now those VPC, if anybody sees in design software for GAP lift VPC, that's where it came from. And it totally revolutionized the GAP lift industry and actually proved that that universal GAP lift design in that old SBE handbook was actually not the best design. And in a lot of scenarios, it wouldn't unload. So here is, again, another classic case of understanding the basic fundamentals and doing a whole wave change throughout the industry while still working with the existing technology, but now we could design it better. So then talk to me about the difference between the fundamentals and using fundamentals versus something else that you refer to as bandage technology. So bandage technology is what I use when accessories or tools crop up to help mitigate a situation that doesn't actually address the root cause. And there's many situations where we need a quick fix where bandage technology could be used, but again, it's only a temporary solution. And a lot of times the bandage technology, well, you think it comes up with a quick win economically. A lot of times just by doing proper design or operating practices, you didn't even need to buy that tool and then run the risk of it being a weak link in your downhole string as well. So there's a quote that I use in the article from Jack Nicholas, of course, the famous American golf throw, and it says, learn the fundamentals of the game and stick to them. Bandage remedies, never less. And even though that was a golf quotation, I thought it was very relevant to my column. But now also looking at that quote, I'm very remiss that with our current stay at work, stay home situation, I am not looking forward to when I first hit the golf course and doing those initial swings. It is not going to be free. And we do want to remind everyone that you wrote this in February. But with a lot of today's current circumstances, getting the funding for some of these initiatives may be a little bit more difficult. Exactly. We were just starting to see the funding return into research programs since the last downturn. It's sad because I was very fortunate for a big part of my career to work in a time when both operators and manufacturers funded research and testing programs to understand these fundamentals and validate the performance and operating envelope of the technology. And I also want to give emphasis to that last point. One concern that I have, it's twofold. One is manufacturers commercializing technology without really understanding the operating envelope or using theoretical equations to set the performance ratings. And then on the flip side, I also see operators forcing manufacturers or putting pressure on manufacturers to commercialize technology before it's well understood either. So that's a big issue. But you're right, with this time now, usually funding for any sort of research programs, that's usually one of the first things that get cut. And then the question is, in my article, who now is researching the fundamentals? Well, actually, that's a good question. Now, who is? Even through this economic scenario we're in right now, who is still continuing the research program to understand the fundamentals? Or once everything gets corrected, who should it be? And more importantly, who should be funding it? Are the model of the collaboration going to go away? Is there going to be expectations from the operators that the manufacturers will be doing this, even though we've already squeezed their margins to almost nothing? It's a question that I don't have an answer for, but it definitely needs discussion. And you also mentioned how one of the bigger issues that you're seeing is the apparent lack of interest by some of those operating companies to even try to understand the fundamentals. Again, a whole new layer added with the pandemic and the oil prices right now. Several years ago, I approached an asset manager. I had a research proposal. This is at a time early in the unconventional development where we were piloting all sorts of different completion designs. And I really wanted to fundamentally understand why one type of completion was outperforming the other. And I was flat out told by this asset manager, he says, I don't care to understand why one outperforms the other, as long as after 90 days of production, there's more oil in the tank. That's all I care to know. Whereas at the back of my mind, I'm thinking, but what happens a year from now or two years from now, is that completion design still going to outperform? Again, we need to understand the fundamentals to get the big picture. So even within your own company, per se, you can have differences of opinions and try and struggle to get support for that research. And when it comes time to do that research, where have you found it most useful to perform that validation testing? Most of mine, because I want to be able to fully instrument a system, as well as basically control all the variables except for the ones that I want to run sensitivity on. And so that usually leads me to a lot of the big research facilities. The one that I've commonly used is CIPR Technology located in Edmonton, Alberta. And when I was writing this column, I reached out to their managing director, Dr. Francisco Alanati, just to see what trends they were seeing with the commissioning of research and testing. And again, a little side note, Dr. Francisco Alanati, he actually has a gas lift equation named after him, mainly on gas lift stability. That was from his time doing gas lift research at University of Tulsa. So again, because a lot of the leadership there really understood artificial lift, I tended to grab a cake towards sending them at CIPR. And anyway, he provided a quote for the article where he stated that, again, keep in mind, I wrote this in mid-February. He said, they have noticed a decrease in demand for new technologies, validation testing. However, what they're starting to see is more working commission to qualify and evaluate technologies with the potential to improve operational efficiency and reliability. Now, again, I'll do a little side note because I mentioned, you know, if I can, I'd like to test more in the control laboratory facility, but also to on all four field testing as well. And the picture that's in the article, it was on one of these trials that we did on the North slope when we were trying to validate CO2 tracer tests. And again, this was a very unique collaboration that just kind of happened. Shell was known for doing a lot of research internal. And in several cases, then they would commercialize the technology. We knew Shell was looking at using CO2 tracers in lift gas to determine lift point. So you wouldn't have to use a click line crew. And we were patiently waiting for them to finish all their testing to commercialize it so then we could test it. But the problem at the time internally within Shell was they could not find a business unit that was willing to test it to validate it. And again, that was a big milestone for them to commercialize. They had to do the validation. So I phoned up my colleague, Joe Shell and said, Hey, I got a whole gaffer field in the North slope. You are more than welcome to come to Alaska and do your final validation test in conjunction with us. And in the end, it ended up being a great collaboration, great results that ultimately allowed them to commercialize the technology. So there are different ways that you can approach it. But whether it's in the field or the lab, it depends on the situation. And I'm hearing too that all of this really offers the opportunity to improve that operational efficiency, which in turn could reduce some costs. We're also talking about more reliability of the equipment. And through it all, I'm also hearing a resounding theme of collaboration. There are some companies that would prefer to keep it internal because they think it's a competitive advantage. But ultimately, the publication and the sharing of these results, yes, they've managed to help the industry, but also too, they've ended up helping the manufacturers even understand their own equipment and design practices. So we can stop focusing or turning out these band-aids and get back to supplying the fundamentals correctly. And there's one discussion point that I have a feeling some of the audience is going to say, well, what about data science? What role does data have to play in all of this? I'm a firm believer that data science will never replace understanding engineering fundamentals. It will supplement, but it won't replace. There's also added pressure on the petroleum schools to be adding data science courses, which could come at the expense of fundamental engineering courses, typically to add something, something else has to go. So I also went to Dr. Alernati for his perspective on this, and he provided this quote that, from our perspective, industry is learning that a pure data-driven approach has a poor chance to succeed for a variety of reasons, that you need to bring some subject matter expertise and engineering understanding of the application, any equipment to improve such a chance. So the current situation that we have now, thankfully, we have data science. And let me explain. When we had our last downturn prior to 2014, it was very cumbersome for companies to evaluate and react quickly in terms of cost reductions and making sure you're doing the right cost reductions in order to survive. And that is not the case today. Our industry has worked hard to consolidate servers, apply data analytics, remote accessibility to so many of our platforms that I'm seeing reaction times now just almost light speed faster. So I think that's why we are going to survive and thrive from this so much better because we have the data science. However, that is still not a replacement for understanding the fundamentals. You mentioned survival, and so many in the industry are being hit hard right now. And there are building concerns resonating within oil and gas. What can SPE do and what really is the society's role right here, right now, dealing with this new downturn? This is our time to show not only our members, but the industry, the importance and the value to what we bring. I'll talk about it in two segments. One is the technical dissemination. Even though many of us are in our homes and aren't able to do face-to-face knowledge sharing, we already bring the platform to get that knowledge dissemination out. And we were reacting quickly. We quickly turned our existing DL tours into webinars, getting that out to members. We are starting to, the first one is going to be end of April. It's a career pathway. It's a whole virtual conference, which is actually happening for the second time. But we're also looking at live streaming and all sorts of other virtual events to make sure that we keep that dissemination going, as well as setting up so much stuff through the app. We managed to drop the price of our papers in one petrol. And I have remote board meetings almost weekly trying to come up with a solution almost weekly, trying to come up with ways that we can still get that dissemination. Now that's from a technical standpoint. Now the other part of it is, this time, it's in a very emotional time. There's a lot of uncertainty with our job. We have students whose job offers are getting rescinded. We got people being furloughed. In my own case, I took a pay cut. It was mandated pay cut, but in order to help my company survive, I took it gladly. And again, emotions are high. There's fear, there's concern, there's anger. And within FPE, that's how to with our moderation platforms or a lot of our social media, we're trying to get the soft skill and allowing people to share their concerns. And one thing I love that's going on right now, too, through social media is people that were negatively impacted during the last downturn, but then survived and had a lot of lessons learned and even found they end up being in a better place than they were with the downturn. They're getting their stories out there and it's sending out all these positive messages really helping to alleviate a lot of the uncertainty and fear that's going on within the membership. So on the technical and also on the emotional support, I am so proud to be a part of this association because we're there in all fronts. Well said. And for all the resources you just mentioned, we will be including links to those in the description of this podcast, as well as you can find more about the online resources on FPE websites and by following the Society of Adjulian Engineers on social media. Final thoughts with Shana in just a moment. First one to get over to the question of the month, the research and development technical section will be reviewing FPE's five grand challenges that our industry needs to overcome. What additional technical challenges do you think we as an industry must focus research on? Please send your responses to president at spe.org. The question again was what additional technical challenges do you think we as an industry must focus research on? You can send those responses to president at spe.org. Shana, thank you so much again for joining us remotely for this podcast. Really enjoyed those sides of the message you were able to provide today. Do you have any final thoughts to share with the audience? It's important we stay positive. So I kind of pause there because again I'm in a home with a depressed teenager, so we're really working harder to stay positive in this household. And again just to stay strong because we're going to get through this and I firmly believe we're going to be through this stronger than ever just like we've resounded times before. Shana Noonan, 2020 SPE president, thank you so much for taking time. Wish you and your family the best and to remain safe. Thank you Jason. And again for you too, stay safe.

SPE Live Podcast: Pre-ATCE Series - Enabling Startups and Innovative Entrepreneurs in Oil and Gas,"Alan, thanks for joining us. It's good morning for me and it's good afternoon for you. And so to everybody around the world, it might even be good evening here. We have a lot to talk about. And one of them is the fact that you are the CTO of AdNoc. This is a new role for the company. So could you tell us a little bit about what you really do? Yeah, sure. Thanks, Trent. So look, let me start off by saying AdNoc has a long and rich history in innovation. For almost five decades now, we've innovated up and down the value chain, from upstream to midstream to downstream. And today, with the creation of the CTO, we're really looking to take that to the next level and really advance and accelerate the importance of technology all the way across our value chain. And so it is truly an honor to be the first CTO for AdNoc and to be able to carry the innovation flag for the company. And really what this signals is a new strategy, a new mandate in terms of the importance and the role of science, technology, digital, and sustainability across the entire company. And that's a unique aspect for the CTO role within AdNoc in that my responsibility covers all three areas, innovation or R&D, digital, as well as sustainability. And we brought all of those together because obviously there's a very, very strong and embedded technology focus to allow us to achieve our long-term goals, whether they're our long-term production goals, efficiency goals, or our long-term sustainability goals as well. Well, and as I hear you talk, you know, these are all very, very popular words that we're hearing in the industry today, but they really all boil down to modernization. And so a lot of people that work in the industry, whether it's on the front lines in the field or in the office, for the last several years, they're still wondering what modernization means and what does it really specifically mean for a company's culture? I think, you know, for us, it means staying relevant. It means staying ahead of the curve. The world is changing, and we all know that we're going through that now. Whether that's, you know, the current pandemic situation that we're all having to work through and to navigate through, or whether it's the current oil and gas prices, the world is changing and it will always change. And so to me, really the essence of modernization is ensuring that we're relevant, relevant not only for today, but relevant long-term into the future. And so there's a couple of key elements that you need to ensure relevancy. For me, the first and foremost is culture. In order for the company to maintain that leading edge on science and technology, you have to have innovation as part of the company culture. You have to be willing to take risks. You have to be patient and impatient at the same time. You have to have balanced investments from the short-term to the long-term. You have to set clear ambitions, targets, goals for what you expect that science and that technology to do for the company. What do you expect in terms of revenue? What do you expect in terms of profit? What do you expect in terms of efficiency gains? And then start to bring together all of the different pieces to build that innovation ecosystem. So what elements around upstream and what new R&D technologies do we need, for example, around drilling? Or what technologies do we need from digital and artificial intelligence? What big data opportunities exist? What machine learning, what machine visualization technologies exist? And importantly, how do we go deploy those effectively and efficiently across all of our assets? And really it's that continual testing, that continual updating really which embodies modernization and again, ensures long-term resiliency. What's interesting, you brought up some very salient points about the digital transformation that companies are going through. And as I listened to you talk, I hear a theme of future proofing. And so one of the decisions for people like you is, this is a fast moving, especially in the digital side, it's a fast moving world. So you have to decide, how do I marry myself to a product or a technology now when I think, there might be something coming up 18 months from now. And so you have to make these critical buying decisions. Does the fast pace of that side of the business make it more difficult? I always look at, say an innovation portfolio as investing, as a set of call options, if you will. And what I mean by that is, you need to place multiple bets across your entire portfolio. So if we look to invest today, we wouldn't necessarily invest all of our portfolio as a single investor in small caps or large caps, or equities or North American funds or European funds. What we do is we balance across all of those different asset allocations to achieve the end result that we want. And maybe that end result is a lot of security, but the trade off of course is very little gain, or we're willing to take much more risk, but the trade off is much more volatility. When we look at R&D, when I look at innovation, I see it much the same way. So today, yes, we need to make some strategic bets on those technologies that will allow us to navigate and overcome the current business challenges and the current macro environment. But we can't lose sight of the long game, so to speak. We need to continue to innovate. We need to continue to invest for the future. And so for me, it's about maintaining that balance, but equally about understanding how much we should invest in each bucket and when to stop projects. And this is always a challenge for R&D organizations and digital organizations alike, is when do we continue to fund? When do we stop? So having that continual testing, say environment, or that continual testing methodology embedded in your R&D portfolio is absolutely critical. So we're making the best decisions at the right time. It sounds like you have to put your venture capital hat on a little bit to think this way and to make these decisions. Want more insights from today's conversation? SPE Publications cover all aspects of the upstream oil and gas industry, from technology and careers to production and operations. Learn more about our peer-reviewed journals, magazines, books, technical papers, and technical reports. It's all at spe.org slash publications. You know, collaboration is a growing theme in the upstream world, and this includes oil companies working together on projects and also people working with small companies. So how is AdNoc doing that in the region? And what is your view on working with startups? You kind of alluded that you look at small vendors as well. Right, I would say partnerships and collaborations are a cornerstone of our company, of our culture, of our DNA, and ultimately of our society. And ultimately of our success. You look back from the earliest days in AdNoc, we have always embraced partnerships and we've embraced collaborators along the way as well. Whether these are partners that come in and help us from a production standpoint or today, partners and collaborators that help us innovate. So taking a couple examples, last year, for example, we partnered with Saudi Aramco and Cambridge University and TWI to establish the Non-Metallic Innovation Center out of Cambridge in the UK. This brought together two reputable oil companies. It brought together a world-class university. It brought together a world-class innovation center, all to solve some of the industry's most pressing challenges around corrosion and limiting corrosion and improving asset integrity for oil and gas materials. Likewise, we have partnerships that we've announced last year as well around the digital and artificial intelligence area. We announced a joint venture with a leading AI company. We also announced signing the world's largest predictive maintenance contract across the oil and gas industry and we signed that with Honeywell last year. We signed agreements on 3D, 4D, advanced seismic, as well as a number of other areas. So for us, partnerships are a true embodiment. And I think in order to be successful for innovation, whether that's the traditional areas of innovation or R&D or digital, we cannot solve all these problems alone and nor can anyone. And that's where the partners come in. They bring a different perspective. They bring in different technologies and they can bring in early stage technologies in the case of universities or late stage technologies. There's some of the more mature partners, but ultimately we need partnerships up and down the different value chain elements as well as the different technology readiness levels as well. Just staying on this idea of collaboration for one more minute, and going back to what we were talking about, cultural change, does the landscape of new digital innovation force companies to come out of their comfort zone a little bit on what collaboration is traditionally meant? And so this is working with companies that maybe have never really lived in the oil and gas ecosystem. Is that something that you're also trying to grapple with? Yeah, when we look at digital, I think the first thing I would say is a lot of people talk about digital and they talk about it at a 40 or 50,000 foot view. In order for the discussion around digital and artificial intelligence to be meaningful, you really have to drill down into the details to understand exactly what is the challenge? What's the problem that we're trying to solve? And oftentimes in R&D and whether there's traditional R&D or digital, the most difficult question is actually framing the right question. Once you understand exactly what you're trying to solve, the answer becomes relatively straightforward. It may not be easy to get the answer, but it becomes much easier to see the path to go from where you're at today to where you want to go. And we do the same thing on digital. So for example, when we start looking at predictive maintenance, we didn't launch predictive maintenance across every single unit operation or process. That's an intractable problem. So what we have to do is you have to understand where can digital have the greatest impact to begin with? What are those unit operations that predictive maintenance can come in today to really move the needle and also help the organization understand the value such that then we can continue to deploy it? And that's our philosophy, whether it's digital or whether it's R&D. And I think today a lot of people and a lot of companies are realizing the impact of digital. And many of them were forced into this into appreciation of digital, given the current pandemic situation. Whether it's working from home or remote working, getting access to data, insights, many companies realize that they weren't prepared for this type of situation. We, on the other hand, have embraced digital for many years. And through our Panorama Digital Command Center, for example, we have access to real-time data, whether we're in the office or whether we're working remotely. And that enables good decision-making, good judgment anywhere around the world. So we were well-prepared for this type of situation, even though we couldn't forecast it. And I don't think anyone could have predicted anything like this had happened. But we've embraced digital for quite a while. And we continue to embrace digital. And I think that's, again, coming back to one of my earlier comments, really what embodies a resilient organization. And I think AdNoc is such an organization. I think we're very resilient. Staying on this same track here, Alan, and since you brought it up about resiliency during the COVID-19 era that we're all living in, and that's the reason why I'm talking to you from my home office, and I imagine you're at home. And so does this current situation, does the price crash, does the societal isolation, I think you can make an argument either way that this could hurt digital adoption, because obviously it's hurting cash flow. But then I'm hearing you make the argument that this is a reason to speed up the rate of adoption. Yeah, I would certainly be in the latter camp. I think for us, we see the power of investing in digital and artificial intelligence coming to life today. Had we not done that over the past several years, we wouldn't be able to do the things that we do today. And so we're a living, breathing example of where you need to invest ahead of the curve, particularly around digital and artificial intelligence solutions. And all of these things are good for business long-term. For example, for a number of years, we've had a number of programs around process efficiency and production optimization. These are things, these are capabilities that we needed not only five years ago, that we need today, and that we'll need in another five years or another 10 years. These are things that pay dividend regardless of what the external markets throw at us or what the price of oil or natural gas is. You have to be as efficient and productive as possible, whether you're in oil and gas or whether you're in specialty products or whether you're in performance chemicals, making specialty goods, et cetera. These are cornerstones of doing good business. And again, I think today it's really opening up the eyes of many different companies, industries, to show them what the power and capabilities digital and artificial intelligence could really have. And again, I think we're gonna come out of this more resilient, I think we're gonna come out of this stronger. And I think the entire industry and I think the entire world is gonna come out looking slightly different. I wish I had a crystal ball to say what we're gonna look like coming out of this, but suffice to say, I don't think we're gonna go back to the way things were. They will be slightly different. And I think we'll all wait and see how much difference there will be as we try to return to some sense of normalcy here over the next couple of months. And I'm wondering if you could give me a specific example of an area of technology that you think is being really impactful, especially right now during this moment where you're maybe not able to send as many crews out to your assets. Is it remote monitoring or is it predictive maintenance? What is really filling a gap amid this current situation for you? So I would point to a couple of things and there's probably a very long list of things that I could highlight. But I think, first and foremost, it's having access to the remote data. So in a time where it's difficult to get out to the fields, to actually read monitors, to send people out there, to make physical tests or perform physical tests, we through our Panorama Digital Command Center have real-time data at our fingertips. This is data that is updated second by second. So we can track the performance of our assets all real time. And by that way, we keep our people as safe as we possibly can as well. So we're not having to put them in harm's way, whether that's with respect to a pandemic such as COVID, or whether that's just keeping them safe by limiting their exposure in potentially hazardous environments. And so that's one aspect of it. I think another aspect moving forward is really this whole concept of connected worker. To some degree, we're connected workers here today on this call. We're conducting this meeting virtually. We're both at home, we're conducting this. When we apply that same methodology in the industrial setting, we may have advanced tools. We may have glasses that have say cameras on them that we can then send that image anywhere across our sites or to our control rooms, but we adopt that same technology. So we can again, minimize the risk, minimize the exposure to our employees. They can go out there and feed back real-time visualization information on how that asset is performing. And then we can coach them through these various tools in order to take the right corrective actions to get that asset, to get that process, to get that pump, to get that compressor, et cetera, to do exactly what it needs to do at the end of the day. Those are two real world examples that I think a lot of companies are deploying today in response to the pandemic, because quite honestly, they didn't have much of a choice, but I think they will realize that these tools will create tremendous value for them moving forward. Fortunately for AdNoc, we've been developing these technologies and implementing these technologies for quite a while, so we feel very comfortable today using many of these technologies. But again, if you look across the industry as a whole, I think many different companies in the industry more broadly will start to embrace more of these connected worker and say remote sensing technologies as a way of working well past COVID. Yeah, I love the last example. The connected worker is, to me, as somebody who studies the technology arena, is one of the lower hanging fruits for you centralize an expert, and whether you're going out and fixing a compressor, and we've seen time and time again, the companies that have adopted that, they've reduced their maintenance times, their troubleshooting spreads across the organization. And so yeah, I can imagine how that would be a very useful technology under today's times. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members.

But let me switch gears for a minute here. With all this talk about technology, we forget that last year's giant theme in the oil and gas industry was all about sustainability and methane emissions and getting those under control. And so, yeah, I wanted to talk to you about the climate issue and how does, what's Adnox philosophy there, and what are you guys actively doing? So sustainability for Adnox has been at our core since our earliest days, since our founding. And this is something that the founding father of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed, really instilled not only in the UAE, but in Adnox. And we live and embody sustainability. And last year, we updated our sustainability strategy. And in January of this year, we launched our 2030 sustainability strategy. And around that sustainability strategy, we define a set of very ambitious targets. Targets that focus on climate change and environmental aspects. Targets that also focus on biodiversity, workforce, diversity, employment, as well as governance. So if you think of, whether you think of sustainability or you think of ESG or environment, social governance, our strategy encompasses all of those different areas. So for example, earlier this year, we had announced that we will reduce our CO2 intensity by 25% by year 2030, and we'll reduce our freshwater intake to less than 0.5% of the total water intake in Adnox. These are very ambitious goals. One of the key reasons why sustainability reports into the CTO is of course, these will require new technologies. Some technologies that we can see today and that we can scale up and implement. Other technologies that are yet to be developed, but that we need to develop in order to continue to be a sustainable company. And whether that's around CO2 or methane emissions, where we are one of the world leaders in low methane emissions and methane flaring, or looking across some of the other aspects, like I say, around workforce diversity and setting targets there. Sustainability to me is one of those things I often say, it's good for business. If we can do these things, we are a responsible producer, we're a sustainable producer, and we can build the confidence and trust across the different markets and across society. Well, on that thread, we have a question. Is solar and renewable energy, for example, keep utilizing new technologies to drive down costs? And we do not do so fast enough in the oil and gas world, we could be out of business sooner. So should petroleum engineers be concerned about this dynamic? I think anytime you consider the discussion around energy, at the end of the day, this does come down to cost. And whether that cost is dollars per kilowatt hour or dollars per kilogram of hydrogen, or dollars per barrel or dollars per million BTU, the numerator is always the same. It's always a dollar, a Durham, a Euro. There's always a cost element there. And I think, as we look to different technologies, whether it's solar or whether it's wind power, there's no denying that those technologies have made significant advancements in reducing the cost of say power energy production. At the end of the day, however, oil and gas is still the lowest cost producer for energy. And we continue to innovate, we continue to develop and launch optimization programs. And I think the entire industry needs to do this. But importantly, to also do so through that sustainability lens. We cannot forget how important that maintaining our focus on sustainability, reducing CO2 emissions, reducing water intake, how important those are, just as much as the overall cost equation side of this as well. So it's about addressing your footprint and doing all you can there, and then acknowledging that you're gonna live with this energy mix. And not trying to put it on a hyperbolic scale just to understand that's gonna be the new Venn diagram of the world's energy consumption. Exactly. And again, another way to think about this is the difference between the art of practical and the art of possible. We have to focus as an industry, as a society, on what's practical today. There are many technologies out there that are possible, but are not ready for broad deployment or are not ready to be scaled. That doesn't mean that there aren't niches or some markets in which these technologies shouldn't be developed or deployed. And we're seeing that today in a number of technologies. That's actually good for the business. But there's not one single solution when it comes to energy or when it comes to fuel that's gonna solve absolutely everything. It will be a mix of different technologies moving forward, depending on the application and depending on the end use. I got another question. This one takes us a little bit back to digital technology, but is AdNoc bullish on technology and innovation around data analytics to drive down the technical cost of producing each barrel? So maybe here, this is not as much about operations as it is about the exploration side. And so, could you comment a little bit about that? Yeah, when we look at, say, the digital landscape, we again, we come back to upstream, midstream and downstream. So we'll look at the upstream production side of it and understand how advanced analytics, how predictive capabilities, cognitive analysis, for example, can help us produce more efficiently, to help us increase the amount of oil that we produce per well, increase the ultimate recovery factor, for example, reduce drilling costs. We do that right alongside with optimizing our downstream assets, for example, to understand how we can improve efficiency and how we can end to end, maximize the value of every single molecule that we produce all the way from our reservoirs into our downstream and our refined products. So again, we use advanced analytics, we use AI, up and down the entire value chain to maximize the value from reservoir all the way through into our finished goods. Okay, let me just piggyback on that. Being an integrated company, does that give you more vision? Does it make this job easier than if you were just say a pure upstream player? As we have in the United States? Well, I think what it does is we have full end to end visibility, right? So, and we have all of our assets that are of course, located here within the UAE. So that provides a very unique advantage to us. We get full end to end accounting, again, all the way from our reservoirs and our fields, all the way through our refined products, and through our Panorama Digital Command Center, we can make real time decisions on how best to operate our end to end assets. The other aspect of course, with Panorama Digital Command Center, is we can use that to essentially create a digital twin of our assets. And then we can start to do scenario analysis, understand, okay, if we want to optimize a particular variable, whether that's cost of production, or it could be CO2, right? So minimizing CO2 emissions, we can do those different scenarios and understand what we would need to do to the asset in order to operate at that particular condition, to maximize value. And likewise, we can also do that scenario analysis to understand where there may be potential bottlenecks. And in that way then, we can go deploy our R&D innovation engine to go develop new technologies to solve those specific bottlenecks. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

Well, Alan, I got one more question and then I think we'll wrap it up, but let's see if you can tackle this one, okay? So what degree do you view business model or team structure innovation as part of the future operational innovation? So example would be having your staff become more entrepreneurial instead of process driven. We've seen this in some companies, the scrum teams, develop an MVP, these kind of Silicon Valley colloquialisms are moving into oil and gas. So what do you see there? I think this is a great question. And today it's often cliche to say, people are the most important factor, but that is absolutely the truth. We can set, as leaders, as a CTO, I can come in and I can set the innovation strategy. I can set the sustainability strategy. I can set the digital strategy, but without the right people, none of that is going to happen. None of it is going to come to life. And that comes back to that culture dynamic. We need the people to really embrace and embody these different strategies and these different aspects and really live it and challenge the status quo. Go after things, take some risks, but do so informed. Risks isn't, taking risks isn't necessarily being callous about what we do, but it's about taking those chances to say, actually, I think there's something here. I think we should study it. And then putting the kind of the guidelines in place or signposts as I often say to say, you know what, we're going to study it until we get to this point. But if we get to this point and it says yes, well then we'll continue. But if it says no, well then we're going to stop. So it's also about having that discipline. But I think having that business model, having that spirit, that entrepreneurial spirit is absolutely key, especially as you look to some of the more radical or longer term innovation. Because without it, you're really left with incremental innovation and you're moving month over month or week over week, and you're not going to be in it for the long game. And again, that's where that business model innovation really comes in. It's setting up resiliency. It's setting us up for the long term game. Well, Alan, thank you very much. As a matter of fact, you're taking a risk by coming on this live broadcast with us. You're living through a digital transformation experiment here at the SPE. And we really, really thank you for your insights and your time. But for now, Alan, we'll let you get back to what sounds like a very busy job. And so I really appreciate it. Great, thank you, Trent. It was a pleasure speaking with you and thank you all. Cheers."
SPE Live Podcast: Energy Transition Through Innovation & Technology ‚Äì How Europe is Leading the Path,"You're listening to the SPE Podcast, energizing our lives. I'm Paige McCowen. Today we are discussing how to have a successful career in the lift engineering. Our guest host today is Shawna Noonan. Now you might be wondering what the heck is artificial lift. By definition, artificial lift is a critical technology used to keep wells producing when they're incapable of providing that energy themselves, primarily in the form of pressure. Now in J.P.T. in 2014, October issue, if you're interested in artificial lift, you need to pull up that issue. There was a great historical background in artificial lift that we'll put the link at the bottom of this podcast for you to go see. Now, why would you even want to be interested in artificial lift? Well, even though there's no global database to tell us for sure the percentage of wells on this planet on artificial lift, we're pretty sure that estimates of around 90 to 95 percent of the total producing wells on this globe are actually producing by some form of artificial lift. Now I won't get into any more details on that because I have two of the best people to not only talk about artificial lift, but also give a little bit of insight into their careers on how they became artificial lift experts. So let me first read their bios. First is Greg Stevenson. He is a senior engineering advisor for artificial lift at OXIE's Worldwide Engineering and Operations Group in Houston, Texas. In this role, he provides technical support, mentoring, and training for multiple artificial lift techniques. Greg specializes in the various aspects of artificial lift, such as production surveillance, automation, and optimization. He has taught numerous industry courses throughout the world and has written a variety of technical papers and publications on the subject. He is very active in promoting artificial lift through SBE as he currently serves on the JPT editorial committee. He serves on the SBE production and facilities advisory board. And in 2018, he was the program chair for the SBE artificial lift conference, an exhibition of Americas. Outside of that, he serves on the board of directors of the artificial lift research and development council. And he chairs the API task group 19G, which manages 25 product standards, recommended practices, and technical reports related to artificial lift technology. Greg, he's a Red Raider. He's got an ambassador in petroleum engineering from Texas Tech University. I think you know a little bit about artificial lift, Greg. Now we get into Anthony. Anthony Allison, he is an artificial lift advisor for OXIE, where he provides in-house support for the analysis, optimization, and troubleshooting of sucker rod pump wells globally. He has 12 years of experience with sucker rod pumping systems, specializing in the use of automation hardware and software tools to optimize the performance of rod pump wells. Anthony currently serves as the chair of the 2020 SBE artificial lift conference and exhibition Americas and is chairman of API subcommittee 11, which oversees standards related to artificial lift equipment. The other artificial lift equipment from other than the API committee that Greg is the chair of. And Giggum, he holds a bachelor's in electronics engineering technology and a master's in petroleum engineering, both from Texas A&M University. So I am so excited to have both Greg and Anthony on this podcast. And with their patience, I have a series of questions that I would like to ask them. But first of all, I want to thank you for all your service you've done for SBE in the realm of artificial lift, primarily with the chairing of the 2018 and the 2020 artificial lift. And the one thing that wasn't in Anthony's bio that he provided to me is he's one of our wonderful distinguished lecturers this year. Of course, doing the tour, if you want to have any interest in rod pump wells and rod pump engineering, please check out Anthony's distinguished lecturer tour. Now, before I get into the questions, and this is something Anthony and I agree upon, you've been hearing me use the term rod pump well. Because one of the, it's like nails on a chalkboard to both him and I when we hear someone refer to a rod pump well as a beam pump. Little factoid, rod pump 101. A beam pump refers to the surface unit if it's a walking beam and not the entire rod pump system as a whole. So Anthony, you can give me a pat on the back for making that little factoid. You just made me smile more than I can express, just giving that little bit of education to everybody listening. And of course, I say beam pump anytime Anthony's in the room. Yes. So, okay, I've read your bios, but to anybody listening, it's more of they want to understand how you got to where you're at. So let me start with Anthony. How did you get started on artificial lift career path? So for me, it was a little bit by accident. When I first got started in the oil field, I was a field engineer working on flow measurement and well testing products. And Weatherford went through a little bit of a reorg that moved me into the rod pump automation side of things. And that's where I was from there forward. That's where I was from there forward. I was really fortunate in that role to work under a great mentor, Louis Ray, who taught me a lot about optimizing rod pump wells and doing surveillance using rod pump controllers and the SCADA software. And just from that and working in the field with the other projects that we had where we were integrating those tools with pumping units and rods in the down hole pumping system, I was in a unique place to kind of touch every piece of the system and get a good background and amount of experience in it that way. Okay, same question to you, Greg. How did you end up with a career in artificial lift? Okay, so my story kind of started really my first month majoring in petroleum engineering at Texas Tech. So I was I think the lone freshman that got invited or coerced to go to the SPATC in New Orleans, which was a pretty fun experience for an 18 year old. And anyway, so some of the seniors were taking me under their wing. And so we got on the exhibition floor and I see that there's this mob of people surrounding this little guy. And I'm like, who is this guy over there? So you're talking about, you know, I don't know. It's like Tom Cruise or something, right? You say, no, no, no, that's Wink. I'm like, Wink? What's a Wink? It's not a what, it's a who. It's Harold Winkler. He was the chairman of petroleum at Tech and he like invented artificial or invented gas lift. And I'm like, well, really? So they didn't really invent gas lift, but most of what we know about it, he literally invented in the 1950s and 60s. And he was in fact our first inductee as a legend of artificial lift. So anyway, so I got to know Wink a little bit, although not too much. She pretty much stopped teaching by that time. But I kind of at least got an inkling that there might be a career in artificial lift given that, you know, so many people kind of, you know, loved and adored Harold Winkler. So I actually, well, I'm kind of philosophical. One of the reasons I like artificial lift is because I like instant gratification. And if you looked at all the different petroleum engineering disciplines out there, it's like the one discipline where you can like turn a knob and see instant results. And sometimes those results are even good, which is even better. So anyway, when I graduated from Tech, it was also kind of a fortunate thing because we're in the middle of a horrible downturn. And it turns out the only jobs you can get were at service companies. So I went to work for CAMCO, which was the same company that Harold Winkler worked for years before when he, CAMCO gas of manual and all that. And so I went through a series of different roles at CAMCO that kind of got me a deep dive into artificial lift first in gas lift and then later in progressing cavity pumps.

So start shopping today from all of us at SPE. Thank you for your support. Truly, both of you are seen internationally as an industry recognized expert in your form of lift. So how does one or what does someone need to do to be considered a subject matter expert in artificial lift? So the kind of the path that I took and one of the things that I think is really critical is getting out in the field and working close to where this equipment actually gets put into practice. You can do tons of rod designs in the office and send them out to a rig to be run down whole. But if you're never out there while it's being run, understanding what happens to get this stuff installed properly and then what happens after you flip the switch and turn it on to see how it actually operates, you're missing a huge part of the picture of what's happening there. Seeking out mentors with a lot of experience in this. Greg and I both mentioned guys who came before us who spent decades doing this work before we ever met them. That's always been a huge influence on me and helped me move along. We talk about how small the oil field is sometimes and how you go to these conferences and we always see a lot of the same people that we know where we go. Inside of that, the lift community is even smaller. But there's a lot of great people working in this part of the oil field and it's a pretty open and inviting group. There's a lot of guys and gals that I bounce ideas off of all the time for different problems that we're having or new technology that we're looking at. And then teaching. Greg's bio talked about teaching courses in the industry. I've always found teaching is a great way not just to share knowledge that I have but also learn more from the people that are attending the courses. How does what we teach actually translate to what they're doing day to day and get new ideas about how problems are being solved out in the field. You both mentioned it was mentors or an individual, this big artificial lift expert that got you into the business and tables have turned. You guys realize that is now you. Not that you're getting old or anything. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to look at it that way sometimes, I guess. But yeah, it's one of my favorite parts of my job. It's hard to look at it that way sometimes, I guess. But yeah, it's one of my favorite parts of my job really is the engineers inside of OXIE that I talk to on a daily basis about either individual well problems or our regular meetings about high failure wells or new technology that we're looking at and helping them understand what looks good, what doesn't look good, what is the latest greatest new thing that some vendor has that we actually ran in the 70s and 80s and still doesn't really work that well. That's one of my favorite parts of my job really. So Anthony, rod pumps are the biggest population in demographics for artificial lift around the world. Pretty much every continent you step on, there's rod pump systems. But in the case for Greg, because now I'm going to do the question to Greg on how do you become a subject matter expert in nodal analysis and gas lift? First of all, gas lift isn't as prevalent around the world, but many would argue it produces more fluids for a smaller demographic. And I'll give it two parts because one, how does one become an expert in nodal analysis for artificial lift and then in gas lift? Well, that wasn't the question I was prepared to answer. But first of all, I'll just echo a lot of what Anthony said. He took about half my answers. I mean, so I definitely agree with the notion of get your hands dirty and sometimes literally by going in the field or even going back in the shop and tearing down pumps or setting up gas lift valves or whatever, but also seeing lots of different types of problems. And really learning as much as you can that way by solving different problems. So I think that going to work for a service company early in my career was actually kind of a blessing because I was in a global role and I saw some of the most interesting problems from all over the world and was forced to solve them. If you're working for a vendor, you don't necessarily have the luxury of getting to call a vendor. You're the guy and you have to come up with the answers. So that actually helped and that helped in terms of developing my understanding of nodal analysis and all that because I was modeling wells from everywhere, whether it be little, you know, tiny 50 barrels a day wells in East Texas or, you know, 50,000 barrel a day wells in the North Sea or heavy oil wells in this way or whatever. But you saw like every kind of problem that they could throw at you. So, I mean, so that was good. And like Anthony, I agree that one of the best ways you can learn is to teach. So, in fact, like I think when I was about two years out of school, I was forced to travel to Denmark and teach at the school. I've only been to like one myself and that kind of trial by fire really taught me what I didn't know and what I needed to know and really motivated, you know, some of my own learning. And so I think that's really, really valuable. Yeah, I mean, you talk about learning nodal analysis and I mean, I always kind of learned by doing and if I didn't necessarily know the answer, I would find a mentor who could help me figure it out or, you know, you know, read a book, read an SP paper, you know, these days we're fortunate enough to have Petro Wiki. But when I started out, you had this giant book that you could iron your pants with called the Petroleum Engineering Handbook, which makes up most of Petro Wiki. So, you know, I got a lot of information from there and, you know, a variety of sources. One of the things that I think has probably helped me the most in terms of growing, both technically, but also growing my network has been participating in ISO and API committees. So this is something, you know, that we haven't really talked about much, but, you know, Anthony, well, we've all been involved in lots of different things, lots of committees and volunteer stuff, you know, related to the industry. But I feel like the things that have grown my network the most and allowed me to grow them most personally have been serving on API committees. How important are industry standards for artificial lift and the involvement in those committees? You teed yourself up for that one. Okay, perfect. Well, so as far as that goes, so, you know, it's kind of a two-edged sword. So in terms of your own personal development, all right, when you serve on those committees, you have, you know, quality time and windowless conference rooms for days at a time with some of the best experts in the industry, both in terms of, you know, service providers, other operators, AEO consultants, university professors, whatever. And so it gives you an opportunity to really develop a personal relationship with all these folks in ways that you don't, you know, sitting on a steering committee for a conference or something, you know, because you just don't have that kind of time. So, you know, on a personal level, that has kind of helped me in that if there's a problem I can't solve just because I've never been exposed to it, I generally know the person in the industry that I need to call to answer it. All right. So there's that side of it. As far as the use of the standards themselves to the industry, I mean, I really do believe in them. I think that it's kind of a case where a rising tide lifts all boats. So that even if we're not using those industry standards, you know, in order to, you know, purchase our products and our contracts, although I encourage you to do so, even if you're not doing that, having that standard baseline for quality, you know, really ensures that, you know, the equipment across the board at least meets that minimum threshold. And it allows us when evaluating different equipment and different suppliers to have kind of an apples to apples basis for comparing them. So in general, yeah, standards are good. Yes. And well, both all three of us, we utilize, we walk the talk. So Greg and I, over the past several years, when we've gone into audit certain artificial lift manufacturers, we definitely do refer to those industry standards. Now, Anthony, I'd like you to respond to on how important are industry standards for artificial lift? I mean, I think it's critical, kind of like Greg said, of setting a good baseline for all of our vendors and the products that we use. Like he mentioned, you know, it's kind of a, I look at it as a base building block to start from and build your requirements on top of that. Right. So there's nothing in any of our standards that tells our vendors what bearings we should use in a pumping unit. But, you know, based on our experience at Oxy, we have certain requirements that are a little above and beyond what you find in the standard. And that gives us, you know, our starting point and then add our own experiences and our own technical expertise to make sure that we're getting good quality product. And Shawna, you had mentioned, you know, going in and auditing vendors, you know, that's, I've, that was a new thing for me after I came from a service company to Oxy and having that opportunity to go and visit different vendors and, you know, I think that's a really good take parts and audits and understand how they do their processes. And I think that's a great way to learn more in the industry and to build a good relationship with your vendors who are using those standards. Right. And it's not a, some people hear the word audit and their skin crawls, right, because it can be a very negative experience sometimes. And we really try to promote it as a way for us to really understand how their business runs better and how it influences the product that we receive and how we use it in the field. And just a good learning experience for both sides. Greg said, you know, getting involved in the development of these standards and working on these committees, you don't have to be the world's greatest expert in downhole rod pumps. I guarantee you, I'm the chairman of the committee and I'm sitting in these rooms and I am by far not even close to, you know, a world renowned expert on a lot of these standards that we work on. But, you know, you learn a lot from the guys that are those experts that are taking part in that and providing feedback to them on, you know, how do we as an operator use these products that are covered by these standards in the field? And, you know, just to plug that just for a minute, we really need more involvement from people at operating companies to, you know, the people that actually use these products on those committees. Sometimes, you know, we're one of the few in the room that isn't a, from a service company, and we really need to take part in defining those standards as the people that actually use them at the end of the day.

Now, I had mentioned early in the podcast that about 90, 95% of the total producing wells on this planet are producing with some form of artificial lip and the artificial lip systems, they can be in the wells for a really long time and there could be a lot of external factors that affect it. So the question is, because there's so many disciplines, we've got reservoir drilling facilities, how important is it for anyone in oil and gas to have a basic understanding of artificial lip concepts? Greg? So my view is that unless maybe you're a geologist, you know, you basically need to understand artificial lip because every single discipline touches it in one way. And in terms of being able to kind of maximize the value of that asset, you really need to design your wells, build on those infrastructure and so forth in a way that can accommodate artificial lip and allow it to perform properly. So, you know, for instance, you know, if I'm drilling a horizontal well and I have a really skinny well bore with five and a half or even four and a half inch casing, you know, I've probably limited the number of lip methods that will work to like one. The good news is that it's mine, but, you know, that may not necessarily be what's optimal for the asset. And, you know, the same goes with reservoir and so forth. So I've been involved in kind of field development planning, studies and stuff where the reservoir engineers say, oh, well, we're going to put these wells on a sucker rod pump and we built our model, assuming a 500 psi pump intake pressure. And so, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, how did you arrive at that number? Well, it just seems like a good one to us. It's like, well, with the, but your well has like a 2000 to one gas to liquid ratio and you're in five and a half inch casing. You know, it's not possible. We'd have to have like a thousand or 1200 psi pump intake pressure in order to just be able to get the well to produce, you know. So, you know, you need to have that kind of marriage between the disciplines. Okay, Anthony, same question to you. Why should people have some basic understanding of artificial lift, even though they don't want to be an artificial lift engineer? Yeah, I mean, kind of like Greg said, one of the best examples for us is our work with our drilling department. You know, it's five and a half is cheap, right? But it has lasting impacts on the cost of how we operate wells. And for the life of that well, and we've really seen better designs of our wells, not just the size of the tubing, which, you know, we don't always get seven inch casing that we'd like it, but sometimes we do. But sometimes we just get better, smoother well bores. And that has a drastic impact on the life of our rod pump systems down the road. Look, artificial lift touches just about everybody out there, right? It's not just the engineer in the office doing the designs, but it's the guys on the rig who are actually running the equipment in the ground. And even if they know just a little bit more than the basics about what do these rods even do and how does this pump work, then when they're running it in the ground, they have more care of the equipment while they're handling it. Whenever we have a failure and they're pulling it, they have a better idea of what things to look for. So we have a better idea of what caused the failure so we can make sure it doesn't happen again. And that cascades to, you know, the guys in the truck running routes to check their wells every day. The better you understand what's happening down hole, the better you can interpret what's happening at the surface. And when you're having problems with a well, either troubleshooting it yourself on location or how you communicate and how you work with other either well analysts or engineers back in the office to optimize that well. Excellent. Well said. And let me add to business development and asset development because these are people that are making decisions whether to proceed or not based on a lot of assumptions with artificial lift. And we're not saying you have to necessarily be an expert, but you should know enough to ask the right questions and know at what point you need to go see an artificial lift expert in order to answer that question. So well said. So one thing, one of my earliest classes I taught at OXIE, I had pretty much everyone from our supply chain group that deals with rod pump equipment sitting in on my class. And they came to the day one, the basic class and didn't come through any of the design stuff, but they didn't need to. They came and got a better understanding of what are these products that they're buying and what does this actually mean when a vendor comes and talks to them. And I thought that was fantastic to have them there as part of that. So for people that really have not had this basic understanding, obviously there must be some misunderstandings. So Greg, what are some misconceptions that people seem to have in the industry about your area of artificial lift? Yeah, so in gas lift in particular, there is kind of a misunderstanding, particularly amongst pump guys, that gas is really simple. You just put a hole in the tubing and inject gas and presto, you got yourself a well. And it's actually quite a bit more complex than that. You know, to really try to design and optimize a gas lift installation, you have to understand well performance probably in more detail than any other artificial lift systems because where an ESP is going to basically give me the amount of rate and head I ask it to. In gas lift, you really have to know both the inflow performance, outflow performance, PBT, multi-face, all those things. And then there's the complexity of trying to get an installation with 10 or 12 unloading valves to work in harmony. So that can be challenging. One of the other misconceptions, even amongst the so-called experts, is that what Harold Winkler taught us in 1960 about how a gas lift valve works is how they work. And the truth is that was actually a lie. It was a white lie. It was the best he could come up with in 1960, but it's wrong. It turns out that gas valves are not 100% open or 100% closed. They throttle. And to really understand how a gas installation works, you have to understand that throttling nature of a gas valve. And, Anthony, I'll ask you the same question, but since Greg already opened the gates as to little white lies, if you want to talk about static gas separators or anything else, the floor is yours. So the number one thing I think is that people think rod pumping is old and boring and stale, right? That this is the same technology, that nothing's changed in the past 40 or 50 years, okay, now it's got a big metal pumping unit, but it's the same as the old wooden beams that we used to run, and some of which are still running out in Bakersfield. In my master's program, one of my professors, who was one of my favorite ones in the long run, actually said, we're not going to talk about rod pumps. We're just going to talk about gas lift and ESPs. And it just broke my heart. But there's a lot of problems that we still haven't solved, especially around rod pumping unconventional wells and horizontals. You talked about static gas separators. The rule of thumb out there that everybody uses of six inches per second velocity for your gas separator and size everything off of that is an absolute lie. It works really well in a university lab with water and air at atmospheric pressure. I don't know how many rod pumps we have that move nothing but water at atmospheric pressure. At least if they do, someone should probably shut them in for good. That's a big area of my particular interest for us to better understand as an industry. There's always new technologies and new materials that we're looking at. It's been interesting to see even just the last couple of years with sucker rods in particular that metallurgies and processes had not really changed for a long time. And in just the past four years, there's half a dozen new metallurgies that are available to us to solve different problems. There's a lot that's still changing and developing and ongoing with this simple, basic, boring lift system that we call rod pumping.

Now, one of the main reasons why we're doing the timing of this podcast when we are is because we want to talk about the upcoming Artificial Lift Conference and Exhibition Americas. This event first began in 2014. I was proud to be chair of it in 2014-2016. And then I mentioned in the bio that Greg was the chair of this conference in 2018. And now, keeping up the tradition, we have Anthony coming in for 2020. And yes, it's actually gone virtual, like many of our other events, which is kind of putting us into some unknown space. Anthony, I'll put the question to you. So why should someone even consider attending our ALCE this year? So I believe this is our industry's premier event that's focused on artificial lift. There's lots of SPE conferences that talk about reservoir-focused things, drilling conferences, completions, and that sort of stuff. There's not as many, there's certainly not the number of events that focus on artificial lift. And this one, I think, in particular, is very, very high quality in terms of the people that are involved in it, the knowledge that they bring to it and share. And that's really what these conferences and workshops inside of SPE are about is sharing our experiences in the oil field and this particular, in this conference, artificial lift in particular, and learning from one another. I always feel that whenever I go and present at a conference like this, I always learn a lot more from the other participants in terms of the questions that they ask or the discussions that we have afterwards than when I gave the paper. And I feel that events like this give you real-world results and practices that you can take back to your company and implement in your own operations very easily, I think. Okay, Greg, same question, but I'll throw a bit of a twist too as we're very hands-on. We like to see our equipment. We're a very tight community. We like to be together to network, and you've not only chaired sessions, you've presented how in this virtual environment and also what we should get from the upcoming virtual ALCE. Okay, so why should you attend the virtual event? Why not? What else do you have to do? You're stuck at home in the middle of a pandemic. No, I mean, like Anthony was saying, virtual or not, the Artificial Lift Conference and Exhibition is the premier artificial lift event in the industry. Prior to 2014, we really didn't have an SPE international event focusing on artificial lift. It was just a bunch of smaller little events, and they tended to be specific to one lift method. The ALCE covers all major forms of artificial lift and brings together experts for each of them, both in the technical sessions and in the exhibition. You're not necessarily going to be able to physically put your hands on equipment in the exhibition this year, but we will have a virtual exhibition with virtual exhibitors and booths, and there'll be networking opportunities there. It's the next best thing, I guess. You still get all the same great content, and you save your shoe leather not having to climb stairs or ride the escalator up and down to the exhibition hall. Greg, I've done those events in heels, okay? Until you put on my shoes, you don't need to be talking about shoe leather. Sorry, Anthony, you were going to say something. I think the switch to virtual really gives us, attendees, a great new opportunity where, in the past, I would have had to make a decision between staying for another technical session or going down to spend time at the exhibition. If you want to ask Q&A, you need to be there at the time that the paper is scheduled to be presented, so you have that time with the authors. But if you just really want to see the presentation and hear that part, they're all being recorded, so I think it's going to give people a lot greater opportunity to see more of the event than you otherwise would have if you were having to move back and forth from the presentation room and then go down to see the exhibits, or you get caught up talking to somebody in the hallway and miss something. You can kind of go through things at your own leisure this way, so it'll be interesting to see how we all experience that with this switch to virtual. Well, one thing uniq"

We are speaking to you from Abu Dhabi in the 2024 SPE HSES Conference and some of the themes that we're talking about for the ATC will be threads in our discussions from Abu Dhabi. Before we start, I would like to invite you to ATC 2024 Powering the Future of Energy with a Century of Innovation. You'll notice the 100-year anniversary of the ATC, which is a, of course, significant milestone. And so I'd like to invite you to attend our special session, 07, on Tuesday, September 24th at 1545 to 1700 Central Time. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Thomas Hinterseer is the Managing Director and President of the Board of CDEP. He runs safety leadership workshops around the globe. Thomas obtained his law degree in Austria in 1987 and a Master's in Law from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, European Community Law Section. For his 25 years in career in the oil and gas business, he's held various senior management positions with SLB and TransOcean. Thomas was involved from the broader HR perspective in the follow-up of Macondo accidents in the Gulf of Mexico. Thomas, welcome to the SPE Live. Thank you, Tom. Thanks for the invitation to SPE and a pleasure to be here and have an exciting 29 minutes. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you again for agreeing to participate on this and on the panel in New Orleans. And so I'd like to start with asking you a question about what do you think the hard and soft skills are that leaders are required to have to be better safety leaders in oil and gas? Excellent question, Tom. And I think there's a fundamental shift going on with the ever-changing environment we're working in, right? I think some of the certainties and some of the things leaders have been deploying and demonstrating which got them successful in the past are changing quickly. And I think there's different skills required from a leader as well as different mindset while how leaders behave, how leaders interact with teams, how they connect to the stakeholders and the society at large. So some of the tools and some of the skills people need to think about is vulnerability, authenticity, building trust, creating a culture of care, as well as building on the power and the usefulness of AI and connecting to the next generation. So if you think about the whole set of skills and the mindset is shifting and accelerating. And I think a fundamental element, a fundamental point I like to make is that, well, what got us here will not get us there. So if you're truly wanting to create a culture of care and getting us to zero accidents, I think we need to unlearn certain of the behaviors. And it's difficult because some of those behaviors got in specifically senior managers and leaders successful. So they continue repeating but get them into the comics position, a CEO position or higher position organization. And unlearning, letting go some of those behaviors is probably one of the most challenging to tools and things a senior leader needs to learn and do and make space for acquiring new tricks, new behaviors and demonstrating some of those attributes, which I think will make a modern leader. One of the things that we've been talking about this conference as well is that a lot of times we'll provide training around safety leadership to frontline supervisors, middle level managements, middle level managers. And as we've discussed, the senior leaders then have to change their tactic and how they deal with people coming back into the organization with new ideas, strategies, ways of leading safety. What is your advice for those people who are going through the safety leadership training and then coming back in the organization and trying to convince the organization to adapt and adopt these new ways of doing things? It's a very difficult question because I think if unless the senior leaders and if you're talking I think about the board level, Comex, CEO level organizations or leaders of business units, unless they are really convinced and supporting the initiatives of training programs, allowing people to learn new things, it's going to be difficult when people come back highly excited, highly motivated from a few days, a few weeks of training. The danger is they will find the kind of the same environment, the same culture, the same behaviors which they saw when before they went to the training program. And I think the challenge is they are highly motivated, they are fully engaged and they're full of energy wanting to make a change, applying some of the things they have explored, they've learned, they have exchanged with the colleagues and make them reality right the next Monday morning when they get back to the office. And I think part of what it takes is courage. I think as well of debriefing with the senior management and making some constructive proposals, suggestions, some experiments, trying to provoke the system, you won't overturn necessarily and make a completely new thing the next Monday morning. But I think by provoking a few experiments, by challenging a few of the status quo and demonstrating some quick and early wins as to how a new way of doing things is actually accelerating results or getting us better results or getting us the desired results. So I would say pushing a few experiments, communicate largely and creating a kind of a community of change. So I think when they come back, their little snowball and the idea is really to creating an avalanche of change out of those few people who have participated. So communication, experiments, tinkering and going for some low hanging quick wins, which convinces the organization and senior management that they're actually it's worthwhile listening to those people coming back from the training and applying and changing some of the behaviors. Yeah, that's fantastic suggestions. And it makes me wonder that do we afford our leaders enough time for reflection and introspection to where they can think about how we are doing things now, how we used to do things and how we should be doing things in the future. And I think you're just hitting the nail on the head, Tom. I think we have heard it over the last two days here at the HSS conference in Abu Dhabi that one of the big challenges of senior leaders is actually taking the time to reflection, stepping back, making space to actually think broadly. And it's kind of the shift from the superhero leader who actually has all the answers, get the result quickly, delivers, acts, reacts towards the more reflective leader who takes time to introspect, creates an environment which allows people to actually challenge a few of the things and getting the juices flowing with the gator brainstorming, learning from each other, peer coaching. So I think there's a fundamental shift required to make time for reflection. And I think it is extremely critical that you're making decisions based on some acquired knowledge and not knee-jerk reactions. I think the time to actually reflect is why did we have the accident? What were some of the root causes? What are some of the cultural contributing factor which got us into this difficult situation and taking the time of saying, well, what we actually need to change rather than have those knee-jerk reaction, the immediate scene as doing something about it. The campaigns, flavor of the month, those kind of busy fools where we try to demonstrate that we're doing something rather than taking the time to really addressing the root causes and making some fundamental behavioral or cultural changes to prevent reoccurrence. So time, time out and reflection, I think, is one of the key elements leaders need to take and encourage their teams to actually take. Yeah, and I would think that that would also lend itself well to overall industry introspection because we talk about an individual or maybe even a leadership team introspection. But one of the things that we've been hearing about here in Abu Dhabi is how do we benchmark with what other industries are doing where they gather in safe spaces where they can talk about what issues are they seeing as an overall industry. Aviation is one of the classic examples. And they cooperate, even though they're competitive entities, but they cooperate with the government, with NGOs about issues that are common to all the companies. And so my question for you is, do you think that we have opportunities to improve in how we cooperate across companies, across the regulators in our industry? Do we have trust based venues where we can have these conversations that we ordinarily couldn't have in a more open forum? I think that's a key question, Tom. And I think events like the S the S.B. conferences or other industry gatherings are key elements to actually open those floodgates of exchange, of learning opportunities, of sharing best practices, of provoking, of challenging each other. And I think we are still in a very relative early stage because I think oil and gas companies and operators have made a lot of progress. They are actually communicating and exchanging, having some forums with Chetan House rules and rules of confidentiality, including involving and inviting the authorities and the regulators in certain in certain areas around the world. I think where we still have long ways to go is bridging the link towards the subcontractors. All the suppliers or the business partners of oil and gas companies, I think, creating an industry learning community where we are really involving the contractors to the full extent of aligning and discussing and learning from each other. And I think there's a lot of room still via those forums, via joint programs, via joint brainstorming sessions. But I think we need to involve the wider oil and gas community into the think tanking and the exploration. And then, of course, the final step or the next step then would be to reaching out to other industries. You mentioned the aviation industry. Absolutely. Huge learning opportunities. I would think about the nuclear industry, right? Again, a high risk environment, but also going into industries which seem completely unrelated. The luxury industry, the pharma industry, other industries which have very different challenges. But at the end of the day, whatever industry we are in, it all comes down to about people, how we motivate, how we engage people, how we help people to actually wanting to do the right thing for themselves, for their community, for the organization. And I think as our business is about people, it doesn't matter which industry or which company you're operating in. And I think this human performance element, we heard it this week, is an extremely important movement from a way from behavioral safety into let's talk about human performance and what does it actually mean? And that element, human performance, is very independent of whether you're an operator or a contractor, whether you produce perfumes and beauty products, champagne, or whether you're bottling water or planting seeds. And I think that would be the ultimate aim to really learn across industries as well. Yeah, I think what I'm so optimistic about the conversations we're having now that we didn't have 10 years ago around human performance and where leaders can be introspective about how the context is driving that human performance. And so we've heard about the HOP principles, blame solves nothing. But I think context driving performance is something that we can have a lot of discussion about because it may be the context of how we deal with each other, how an operator deals with a contractor, how contractors deal with subcontractors. So what have you seen in that space where you think there's opportunities to connect the dots in context driving behaviors? I think that's a very critical element to be looked at and explored, because if the usual industry behaviors, right, I mean, imagine the oil price changes by a few dollars. The first reaction of the top of the food chain, i.e. the operators, is often to say, well, we need a cost cutting exercise of 10 percent across the board. And basically letters or information goes out to the main contractor saying, well, given the changing oil price, we want everybody to reduce by 10 percent and it ripples down. And that's a kind of, I would call, knee jerk reaction, right? And I think unless we're really looking at the medium and long term relationships, rather than saying we have to optimize the quarter or the six months result or the yearly result, unless we're really saying as an industry, we know that part of the wealth and the future of the world economies depends on the joint efforts and the joint successes of the industry. And the industry is everybody from the lowest supplier of nails up to the super duper oil and gas company. Right. And unless we are really creating that community thinking that we jointly create value not only for the industry, but for the broader stakeholders at large. And therefore we need to think more holistically, systemically, and we also need to think more medium and long term. And all those interruptions and up and downs of the oil price and saving money in one point of time, the high oil price, the contractors are happy and smiling and the operators are suffering and the other way around if the oil price goes down, the contractors are being squeezed. I think we need to find a way of at least stabilizing the curves and taking out the roller coaster effects, because the roller coaster effects means hiring and releasing people. It means limiting innovation. It means reducing costs and R&E. And that has an impact on the quality and on the safety performance if each time we are hiring and firing people based on upsides and downsides circles. So I think there is a need of thinking more holistically and systemically. Yeah, and I think it starts within the companies is how they discuss this, because a lot of times we talk about the safety function and operational leaders driving safety within an organization. But is it limited to that? Are there other functions within an organization who should be involved in thinking about strategically, how do we drive safety? How do we be more? How are we more consistent as an organization? And I think that is one of the next elements where I think we can improve the safety performance. Right. In this conference, there was one of the keynote speakers that actually the person who has a huge influence on HS&E is the CFO. And I think and the example given was what the CFO is looking for optimizing earnings per share, cost reduction, basically the exercise or the reaction I described earlier on this is a most natural reaction from the CFO. And I think if he can align the leaders of the functions to think more holistically and going more transversely, what is my impact as a CFO? What is my impact on from an HR perspective? Am I promoting the right people? Is my reward system rewarding the right behaviors? And I think if you start the conversation of getting the function heads thinking outside only their own, let's say, vertical function, but thinking just transversely and saying, what in my function as CFO, CHRO, head of marketing and sales? What is my contribution to the well-being of the employees to do overall performance and outcome of the organization rather than only of my department? And what is my organization, my function actually contributing to make it happen? And what are some of the roadblocks inadvertently, not intentionally? The function is putting up preventing advancement in HS&E. And I think those kind of conversation need to happen if we can get not only agencies, the challenge of the line manager and the agency department, but it's a cross board. Everybody has their contribution and responsibility and accountability towards making safety happen and being accountable for the results, the good, the bad and the ugly. I think that speaks to also developing one of the common threads this week has also been the discussion around psychological safety and trusting your organization and trusting leadership because we cannot get to the point we need to get where we've managed the risk across the board and people aren't getting hurt until we get the trust where people are willing to speak up and the organization responds. So what would you do with leaders who either are unresponsive or challenged in their responses when we talk about someone bringing up an issue, stopping work, asking for more tools, training to improve how they work safely? Well, I think that that is really the core responsibility of a leader, right, is to provide and set the context to provide the tools and the training for people to actually do the things right and do the right things right. And I think if the senior leader is not in that mindset and is not actually set in that context, he or she is not doing the job. And I think it needs to be a very clear conversation between that supervisor, supervisor. And of course, the more you move up in the organization, the more critical those conversations become, because the top basically is setting the context and the culture in which the organization as a whole functions. But I think we need to be very clear if a person is not convinced after conversations and engagement and having meaningful exchanges as to why things are important, if that person is still not providing the leadership, walking the talk, being visibly seen as supporting the drive into a culture of care and towards setting the culture of a high performance organization. We need to remove that leader. We need to move that person. I think we cannot afford to keep on people who are counterproductive, who are preventing others in good faith to move forward. Stuff conversations. And it's not I'm not saying that the first strike people are out, right? I think we need to engage in conversations. We need to help them. We need to make them see the light. But at the end of the day, there's only so much time we want to spend on people who are not prepared to actually carry the weight and help their teams and the organization to move forward. So I think we need to be help holding people accountable to the extent that we have spent the time to make it very clear what it means, what looks good, looks like giving them the tools and the means to be successful. And then we help them accountable with regard to the results. OK, and I think we've got a question from the audience on a feedback from Tessie. Woozy, my approach focuses on first understanding the workplace culture, allowing individuals the space to show vulnerability and acknowledge genuine mistakes. This creates an environment where we can catch effectively and foster growth, leading to more meaningful development and accountability over time. I think, yes, Tessie, that that is a very an approach which will result in success. Right. But that means you're basically adopting already a very open approach of encouraging conversation, encouraging speak up and you're creating a culture of trust. And I think that you're doing the right things of encouraging people and acknowledging genuine mistakes. Right. And you're giving people the means to correct, to learn, to move forward. That means you're setting from your perspective already clear messages and you're walking the talk. Right. And I think that is an extremely good example as to how you actually build trust, because trust is not something you command. It's something people will trust you because you're consistent, you're fair, you hold people accountable for the good and for the bad things. And I think this consistency and transparency is one of the key elements to create the culture of success and higher reliability of the organization. So absolutely. Yeah. And one of the things we know about building trust is there's actually a physiological change in your brain. Chemicals are released that enable you to trust people. Now, when people treat you poorly, there's other chemicals that are released that break the break your ability to trust that person. And it builds over time. So, again, it's our conversations. It's the way we lead people that will build trust, which is actually becomes hardwired in your brain because of the chemicals released during positive conversations. We have a question from Bertrand on LinkedIn. How can we develop leadership within ourselves? How many hours do we have? I think that is an absolutely fascinating question. And I think part of at least from my perspective, the answer lies within is what are your values? What do you relate to? What do you want to be remembered for? And often I ask the question to people when you leave your job, I think that's either you resign, you're promoted, you retire. What is the one thing you want to be remembered for by the people who have to work with you? And unless you're very clear on the answer, what you want to be remembered for, I think it's difficult then to say what your leadership style is. Right. And I think if you ask that question, what do you represent and are your values aligned with the work and the values of the organization you're working for? And I think those are some fundamental initial question, because if you're not aligned with your own personal value system and the value system organization, you always will be challenged to motivate and to be seen as an authentic leader, because people will know that you're not really aligned between the organization value and your own personal value. The other point I would like to make is developing leadership in yourself is taking time to reflect and unlearn some of the things which got us very successful till today and being cognizant about the biases. We all have our biases. Is it confirmation biases, group thinking, complacency? So if you look at the bias system, I think being conscious, self-conscious about where we are in our leadership journey, I think those are some of the some of the elements I would look at. Tom, what do you think? Yeah, absolutely. And again, we know a lot more now about how the brain works, including the physiological reactions to conversations that allow us to be social creatures. And if you don't know that that's going on, you're going to develop you're going to build a barrier between you and your employees, employees that you're not even aware of. But they are and they'll respond accordingly. Well, I know we have some more questions, but it looks like it's about time for us to wrap up. And so I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. And and thank you for your questions as well. Thank you, Thomas, for joining us. Thanks for the invitation. So I encourage again, everyone to join our live panel session at the conference in New Orleans, the 23rd through the 25th of September, just a couple of weeks. Again, we'll be meeting in the afternoon of Tuesday, September the 24th in Exhibit Hall B2.1. And you can use your phone to scan the code. To learn more about the ATC. And if you are going to attend the ATC, I highly encourage you to attend the training that is going to be around sustainability culture. And the instructor will be Marimba Dorado. And you'll have a session on launching your green team, developing key sustainable development goals and engaging clients. So, again, I encourage you to see that's a day long training session on creating a sustainability culture. Thanks again, everyone. Thanks for listening to the SPE Live podcast.

SPE Live Podcast: Generative AI Implementations on Spatial Data,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live Plug-in Abandonment, What's the Big Deal? The audio from this episode was previously recorded on April 8th, 2024. And now your moderator, Bart Joppe. Good morning, afternoon or evening. My name is Bart Joppe. I'm the well abandonment leader at Beke Utreen Houston. And it's my pleasure to host this SPE Live session, Plug-in Abandonment, What's the Big Deal? I thank you for joining us on a brief introduction to the content that will be discussed at the upcoming SPE webinar series, the virtual workshop Transatlantic Plug-in Abandonment Operations, which will be hosted virtually on April 23rd to the 25th. We're still looking for sponsors, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in a sponsorship opportunity. So the event is intended to identify the technical and regulatory challenges our industry is facing and discuss how we're tackling these now and planning for the future. During this SPE Live event, we will have industry experts engage in the long-term well integrity methods and challenges to securing wells during final plug-in abandonment to ensure isolation and protection to the environment. We'll also talk about adoption of new technologies and why the industry struggles to try new things, especially in the P&A space. So today I will be joined by two experts. First, I'd like to introduce Salo Aludia-Barcelos. He's a P&A advisor at Petrobras. Salo has over 10 years of experience in offshore work over and plug-in abandonment operations. He's a skilled professional of various roles within the oil and gas industry, including company men and well-designed engineer. Currently, Salo serves as plug-in abandonment advisor at Petrobras, a leading global energy company. He plays a crucial role in supporting offshore interventions, providing valuable insights and guidance to the well design and operation teams. Salo's profound knowledge and proficiency in this field contribute to the success of complex projects. I'll also be joined by Matteo Loizo, a consultant. Matteo has been an international consultant in well integrity and CO2 storage for 12 years. His previous career with Schlumberger spent field operations, research and development, QHS&E and carbon dioxide geological storage. His current research interest includes harnessing creeping formations such as salt and shales to help control well leaks, modeling leaks through cement, inverting geophysical measurements and quantifying methane emissions from oil and gas wells. He also provides technical training in the field of CCUS, plug-in abandonment, well integrity, management systems and process safety. Matteo holds a master's degree in aerospace engineering from the Rome University La Sapienza, Italy, and has authored or co-authored 31 technical papers, as well as a book chapter on CO2 storage. And he is a program chair of the SBE well integrity technical section, which I encourage all of you to sign up for. Salo, Matteo, welcome to this SBE live event and thank you for your contribution in advance. For the audience, if you have any questions, please ask them through the chat and we'll discuss these towards the end. So let's start on the regulatory and stakeholder side of things. Let us start with providing an understanding of what's required to provide a robust and reliable well abandonment solution and who are the key stakeholders. Salo, I'll start with you. Can you provide some perspective on the regulatory requirements for well abandonment in Brazil or more specific for Catarbras? Yes, sure. The Brazilian well integrity management system, also called SEP, is quite similar to the one applied in the UK. To understand this, we follow the concept of map-based well barriers, restore the original ceiling provided by the Catarrock, and ensure the isolation of aquifers and intervals with flow potential. The best approach for a permanent well abandonment is to set at least two well barriers, whether separate or combined, to prevent unintentional flow to the external environment and at least one well barrier to prevent an acceptable fluid flow between intervals, not naturally connected. These elements need to be long term approval and installed and verified following its specific acceptance criteria table. However, I'd just like to highlight that at least one point about the Brazilian regulations, which differs from the European one, is that all the costs related to the decommissioning are borne by the operator. We have a lot of similarity, but some changes that make the difference here in Brazil. Thank you for that insight, Saulo. Matteo, what do you think will drive the regulation and our social license to operate as an industry over the next five to ten years? Well, you know, let me get out and polish my crystal ball. But I think our industry reputation is coming back from the brink. OK, so it's becoming widely accepted that hydrocarbons will have to be used right until the day that we will not be using them anymore. And that will be like far into the future. However, there is one thing that will not be forgiven, which is wasting methane through emissions. So in a way, the biggest challenge, which is already there and which will drive operations and abandonment in particular, is stopping methane leaks from wells, especially abandoned wells. There is another challenge we're facing now in some places, which is what some people call zombie wells, which I really like the term. I'm not quoting the source, which is like large emitters, which is like suddenly Farmer Joe is walking through his field and then comes like a huge gusher, like a blowout, in particular like a brine blowout. This is something was not necessarily expected. And it's a consequence of us using actively the subsurface for injection. This is limited to places where there are very old wells, wells that were not abandoned properly. And we never figured out until we started poking at them. So in a way, Bart, I guess the biggest challenge will be missed emissions, but we will not be able to fully recover our reputation if we are not able to avoid big individual blowouts, unexpected ones. Interesting Matteo, let me ask a follow up question on that to you. So you talk about the brine leaks, you talk about the methane leaks. Are all leaks bad or is there some tolerable leak rate for abandoned wells? I know it's a contentious question. Yes, to say the least. Well, yes, I'm on the contentious side of it, Bart. So let's put it this way. Like huge leaks of brine or oil or whatever really, you know, CO2, whatever you want to put underground, they are unacceptable. A blowout, there's no way that we can we can paint it with, well, that's a nice fountain, right? Nobody cares or whatever. Methane leaks are a bit more problematic because they span like a huge range of possible rates. And in general, the smaller the rate, the more wells are leaking that much methane. So where do we put the tolerable limit? Where do we put the limit in which now you don't really have to repair it? My personal point of view is that it should be around 10 cows, which is give or take about a half a ton of methane per year. Now, we will not be able to get away with, oops, sorry, you know, it's like five cows more. Who cares? We'll have to pay for it. As an operator saying, I don't want to repair it, we'll still have to pay for the emissions and the equivalent CO2 emissions. At least we will not be obliged to start playing around with an abandoned well. It can be very, very expensive, especially offshore. So we'll probably will figure out that the tolerable limit will be somewhere where the damages is negligible and contained and well understood. And then above that, we will be obliged to intervene. It will be something like an API limit on what we normally use on leakage run safety valves or annualized sustained annual pressure, the fourth and B standard. Okay. Thank you, Matteo. Salo, over to you. Any thoughts on acceptable leak rates from your perspective? Yeah, yeah. But first, a brief consideration here. All leaks are undesirable, and we must work to prevent them. Which is why the industry is always seeking to evolve. But it's a fact that not everything happens the way we would like. And when that happens, a new decision needs to be made. In other words, at this moment, when the leak happens, the decision context is different. The leak exists and the decision to intervene or not needs to be made. In this condition, we may identify some guiding topics that will support the decision, including the CO2 emission balance itself. Does it make sense to intervene well with a minimal leak rate compared to what would be needed in a reabandonment intervention? Therefore, the discussion needs to evaluate the global impact, considering the possible solution in a holistic assessment. And it is possible that in some cases, it may be concluded that the best course of action is not to intervene. Okay, well, thank you for that. So let's move on to the part of plugin abandonment planning and delivery of operations. So we just learned how important it is to design and plan for well abandonment, barrier verification, a placement of permanent barriers is also critical to ensure successful abandonment. So, Matteo, over to you. Why do abandoned wells fail? Right. So I guess there are two scenarios that by now became clear. One is that we never abandon them properly. So there is this notion of temporary abandonment. The difference with permanent abandonment is that in the temporary sort, we rely on steel. So basically, this part of our blanket, our barrier, which is made of steel, and steel has the habit of corroding away and leaving holes. So whenever we have a centimeters or so steel and rely on it, then we're kind of doomed within about 20 to 30 years. So there is a number of wells that were never abandoned in a correct way. So basically, we never ensured that we have like this one or two blankets that with cement or rock. So that's the first thing. So the wells which are never any good. So now they're leaking because we're bound to leak. These are normally what we see creating zombie wells, you know, blowouts from abandoned wells. The other ones is where we thought, they're actually abandoned well, for what we thought was a good pressure. So basically, this well said rating, and we exceeded the rating. This is what we see in many cases, where we put our blankets, we put our barriers, they're rated for say, a couple of thousand psi and then suddenly we increase the rest of our pressure to 3000 psi. And guess what? They're leaking. They're not leaking a lot, but they're still leaking. So this is what we need to deal with, you know, recognize the old wells, which we never quite did a correct good job with, and ensuring moving forward that everything we abandon is future proof. Well, thank you for those insights. So what I'm hearing is that placing the barriers at the right geological depth for the anticipated future reservoir pressure is critical for successful well abandonment. So hey, Saulo, let's move over to you. Can you elaborate on the improvements in barrier verification processes and methods you are using? Yes, sure. The verification of barriers consists of meeting two parameters, the positioning and the tightness. There are interesting differences between the two parameters. Such as the technology to confirm the positioning through indirect measurements, like using acoustic pulses, for instance. Also, we see some improvements in the development of tools that achieve conclusive responses regarding the tightness of the barriers. With devices that reduce the pressurized chamber, others that allow the pressurization in the upward direction, deep lead scenarios, and even ones that enable the gas exposure to the element. One important point here is that these are new technologies, so they still lack qualification and affect record to ensure their reliability. Yeah. Thank you, Saulo. But Mattheo, over to you. Do you think we'll ever be able to log to two or three tubing slash caching strings? Okay, so the answer would be yes and no. So we're already able to log through the two or three tubes and see what happens. The problem is that what we get is, well, I guess the politically correct expression is rubbish. Meaning that the only way that we can go through one, two casings, the tubing, is through the two or three tubes. So all the logs we have are like dumped down CBL. All they're able to tell us really is, well, we're going to have to do the same thing. Is that we use low frequency waves like the old CBL. And CBLs are very, very finicky and they do not like to be eccentric. They like to be exactly in the middle of things. So all the logs we have are like dumped down CBL. All they're able to tell us really is where the top of cement is. Which if you look at all the modes of failure of cement, it's not necessarily such a useful piece of information. On top of it, you know, they tend to be confused like all CBLs between, is that fluid, which is really bad, or is it a liquid filled microangulus, which is, you know, a nuisance, but like common cold kind of thing. Not really deadly. So, well, I think we'll have to do in another way without logs, which is possible around the logs where you build away, which is what you should be doing. Yeah. Hey, let's thank you for that. Let's continue our conversation about new technology and materials. So although sealing the well and full compliance with local regulations is our first priority, it's also critical to provide an efficient and cost effective well abandonment solution. So development of new technology will be key to reducing the total cost of operation, which everybody is aiming for. So, Soundhove, first to you. How do you see the application of alternative material for plug-in abandonment? I'm very optimistic about the materials for the PNA scenario. The potential for developing materials with performance at least similar to cement is quite significant. So, it opens up new opportunities for abandonment strategy, especially in the fluid scope, such as adopting shorter bare extensions when compared to those used for the cement. Also, can be enabling to tubing PNA in some specific scenarios like high deviation well. And perhaps a bit further down the line, allowing remotely permanent plug-in abandonment operations. So we have a large number of opportunities here with the development of these new materials. Good. Matteo, what technology gaps do you see for cost effective well abandonment in our industry? I'll give you two answers. The first one is proper technology. And it's one thing that kind of keeps you awake at night, which is in general PNA, the success of PNA is dictated by rock. So rocks that creep, shales and salt, they're the ones that are clamping our wells, are shutting down the interfaces and are preventing bubbles from coming out from the other surface. So what keeps me awake at night is if you get too shallow, if we have like a gas accumulation, which is too shallow, then there's no way of keeping it down. It will find its way to surface and we can't repair it. Because I would like really to see technologies that can get us beyond the closure stress that the formation applies to probably the fracture pressure or even higher. So I love all the slash and burn thermite applications. I'm a bit skeptic, but hey, can they help us restore or even increase integrity when we're getting too shallow? Because for the moment, the answer is no. So the other technology I'd like to see is I shouldn't call it a technology. It's more like standards and the way we do things, regulations, which is the big challenge nowadays is going full for risk based, basing wide. If we give you one concrete example in the southern North Sea, you always will. In most cases, you drill through like about a mile worth of salt and every cement job I've seen through this mile of salt is like perfect. Do I need to log everywhere? Really? So that's the kind of thing where I think the industry together with regulators and the enlightened part of society, civil society, we could probably get together and say, hey, how can we be sure that this thing will work? How can we focus our resources and time on the wells, which are really the bigger emitters, you know, the 2% of them. Okay. Okay, thank you for your insights there, Matteo. The last question before we take questions from the audience goes to Saulo. Saulo, please tell us about the developments on the true tubing abandonment, especially in sections with cables, control lines. How do you see those? Okay. One of the few perspective requirements in our regulations is the absence of cables and lines in the well-being cross section. So we are monitoring developments related to overcoming the restriction. And we see several methods and concepts being developed. There are studies evaluating the feasibility of allowing the positioning of the well-being in this completion section with the flat packs by adopting specific mitigation measures. For instance, increasing the total extension, analyzing the degradation of the completion of the flat pack over time, using specific cement additives and so on. Another approach is to remove the flat pack cable, interrupting its hydraulic continuity. There are less or more destructive approaches, whether through mechanical or chemical methods, about this technique. Overall, there is significant investment being made and knowledge being generated. So I guess just a matter of time and maturity for implementation since given that the industry's efforts and engagement seem appropriate. Thank you, Saulo. That's really good to learn all the activity and the progress you're making in the space of true tubing well abandonment. I think that's going to benefit us as an industry for sure. So now let's have a look at the questions you've asked through the chat. And also thank you for joining. We did see it in the bottom left corner here. We have people attending from Malaysia, Qatar, Turkey, Norway and Angola. So we've got a lot of continents covered today as well. I'm actually going to combine the first and the third questions. So the first question is from Soran Weiss in, well, it does say we have it. And as put today, how many wells have to be P&A'd? How many in Europe, the Gulf, Mexico, et cetera? So Saulo, let's go first to you and start with Brazil slash Latin America. What do you see in your area of the world? And then we'll go to Matteo. OK. Well, talking for Petrobras, we have hundreds of platform wells and also hundreds of subsea wells. I mean, probably we'll have even more because the wells will get old and will come to the abandoned phase. What's its life cycle? So we have a huge campaign. I would say that the commissioning forecast expects Brazil to be the largest spender, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States in the upcoming year. So we have a big campaign here to abandon. And that's partially due to your significant inventory of subsea wells, of course. Yes. Matteo, what about Europe? What do you see over there? Because you're based in Germany. Yeah, so Europe, there's not a lot of wells around, even if we include Norway, the UK. It starts becoming hazier when you go to the very, very old oil provinces, sort of Romania or Baku, for example, where there's a very, very old, long legacy of wells built from the 1800s, roughly. So in general, in Europe, if I remember correctly, we might have about probably less than 20,000 wells, like west of Romania. That compares to a worldwide total of around 10 million or so. So these are the order of some of them. Some of them, most of them are abandoned, are supposed to be abandoned. Estimates of wells which are not well abandoned in the state hovers around a million, you know, 100,000 to a million, the orphaned wells, the ones that have never been abandoned properly and need to be dealt with now. Yeah, to continue the answer of the question, Soren, in the Gulf of Mexico, plug-in abandonment levels have varied from about 500 to 1,000 wells a year, especially after the idle iron. There was a big spike in activity in the US on land. We do see, or the US and Canada combined, we do see between the 20 to 25,000 well P&As each year. So those numbers are quite large. So there's fewer in the North Sea, of course, but them all being offshore, the expenditure is actually quite high. I'm going to answer question three myself, also from Soren, how many new P&As are added every year? That's very difficult to tell, right? Because we do have new drill wells. So they're in the order of maybe 80 to 100,000 wells a year being added. But there's also additional well bore by well deepening, side tracking, salt recovery. So it can't give you a conclusive answer, but think about the order of about 100,000 a year. It's not a bad start. We'll take one more question from the audience and then we'll have to close off unfortunately. And that's from Matteo. So please answer concisely. In Norway, they use swellable shields as a barrier. How common is that in the rest of the world? Ah, concise. Right. So Norway is at the forefront. They've been doing it for a very long time, you know, bordering exceeding now 10 years. However, I see, for example, in the southern North Sea in the British sector, people that start using salt very, very effectively and in a proper way. Australia, they're getting on the bandwagon like it's an industry wide effort to actually identify the proper formation, qualify them and then apply them systematically. There's other countries where you can see it coming. And one of them with the highest potential is the United States. There's no concerted industry wide effort, but there are a few actors and a few companies which are looking at it and doing it in sometimes in the proper way. So, yeah, Norway, but it's not they're not alone anymore. Yeah. So, you know, firstly, we couldn't get to the the other questions today. There's a couple of more in the chat. So I will take a note and I'll be able to reach out to you through LinkedIn and connect with Matteo and Saulo to answer those questions offline as well. But I do thank you for that. So this will bring an end to the SPE live event on Plugin Abandonment. What's the big deal? First of all, we'd like to thank our subject matter experts, Saulo and Matteo for sharing their thoughts today. Much appreciated. Also like to thank the audience. Hope that you found it informative and that you want to learn more. And lastly, there is the reminder to learn more by registering to the SPE webinar series, the virtual workshop on transatlantic plugin abandonment operations, which will be virtual from April the 23rd to the 25th. With that, I would like to thank you and hope to see you again. Thanks for listening to the SPE podcast.

SPE Live Podcast: Gaia Talk ‚Äì Real Decarbonization. Seizing the Low-Carbon Future,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the SPE Live Technical Director Series, Drilling Operations and Progress within HSEES. Can we do better? The audio from this episode was previously recorded on March 1st, 2023. And now your moderator, David Reed. Hello and welcome to SPE Live. Today's show is Drilling Operations and Progress within HSEES. Can we do better? So I'm looking forward to that. My name is David Reed. I'm the Chief Technology Officer and Chief Marketing Officer for NOV, and I'll be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes, so there will be encouraging people to put questions in, and so we can respond to that during the show. Okay, so now my pleasure to introduce our guests. First up, we have Sue Staley, and she is the SPE Technical Director for Health and Safety, Environment, and Sustainability. She is the Sustainability Director for VPSI Group, LLC, where she leads the company's sustainability practice. Prior to joining VPSI, she was the General Manager of Soil and Groundwater Technology at Shell. She's had various positions within Shell during her 18-year tenure. She's been an Environmental and Safety Engineer for 30 years, and Sue holds a Master's degree in Engineering, Environment Emphasis from Purdue University and a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. Our next guest is also Robin McMillan, who's the SPE Drilling Technical Director and the Chief Sales Officer at DataGumbo. He's worked in drilling both offshore and onshore in Mexico, Venezuela, UK, Spain, Norway, Congo, Gabon, Syria, Libya, Canada, and the USA. Robin has several technical publications, served on program committees from various IEDC and SPE conferences, and is both Vice Chair and Membership Chair of the SPE Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section. He holds a Geology degree from Leeds University in the UK and a Further Education Teaching Certificate. So Sue and Robin, welcome to SPE Live. Sue M. McMillan, Chief Sales Officer, DataGumbo, USA Thank you, David. Robin McMillan, Chief Sales Officer, DataGumbo, USA Thank you, David. Good morning. David B. McMillan, Chief Sales Officer, DataGumbo, USA Yeah, good morning. It's good to have you here. So let's start with Sue. So what is happening in the HSEs world? Sue M. McMillan, Chief Sales Officer, DataGumbo, USA Well, actually a lot is happening in the HSEs world, and it's my pleasure to talk to you about it. First of all, there's two technical sections within HSEs. We have the Human Factors Technical Section and the Sustainable Development Technical Section. But in addition, there are cross-discipline technical sections that HSEs professionals get involved with, like the Methane Emissions Technical Section, Water, Lifecycle, and Strategy, and even Data Science and Engineering Analytics. But our two technical sections are very active. So in the Human Factors Section, something that was just recently completed was a collaboration with the IOGP on developing new guidance on learning from normal work. There's an SPE live on that, so you can go out and check that out. And this community is very active in working with other disciplines on human factors issues. They've just completed their vision, and they want to be the go-to team when somebody's thinking about human factors within our industry. And so here's a plug for all of you human factors folks. They're looking for specialists to join the technical section to help share their expertise and become that, and to fulfill the vision that they've set for themselves. And in the Sustainable Development Technical Section, again, it's very active. You've probably heard of some of the events under the Gaia brand. We have a very active LinkedIn community as well. There's 1,500 members in the LinkedIn community devoted to talking about sustainability and those issues within SPE. Well, this month, it's March 1st today, so in two weeks, there's going to be a Gaia Summit in Oman. It looks like it's going to be a very exciting summit. It's two days, the 15th and the 16th. We're also planning for an Energy Transition Summit. This is not hosted by Gaia, but we are part of the team that's putting that together. That will be held in August. And then we're also planning some great sessions and a Gaia dinner at ATCE. This is a wonderful community to be a part of, and I invite everybody who has any interest in sustainable development to join that technical section. Back to you, David. Yeah, thanks. That's exciting stuff. I think Gaia is fascinating as well. There's a lot of fun things going on there. So that's great. Yeah, Robin, I'm not going to ask you what's going on in drilling. You were ready, but I'm not going to. I wanted to ask you something related to safety in the drilling space. How is drilling doing on the safety side? That's a good question. As you will know, there's been a lot of focus on drilling. In fact, all stakeholders in drilling, so many operators, contractors, service companies, OEMs, have had safety at the top of the priority list for many years. Part of the reason for some of the success is the industry collaboration. I think it's well recognised that this isn't an area where we want to compete. It's actually where we want to collaborate and help each other. To that end, the IDC, which is the, you might have to pull me up on a few acronyms, International Association of Drilling Contractors, has for many years, in fact since the 60s, put together the incident, what are they called, ISP, Incident Statistics Programme. That shows this is where all the contractors put their data in. There are over 70 companies now that are doing that. This means that everybody has the chance to go look at that data and see how their own performance compares with everybody else. The way they present that data is in a form which is where you can really analyse what's going on. For example, it will be split by, for example, an incident. Where was it on the rig? Who was it? What was the position of that person? What was their age, for example? What was their seniority, etc. It makes it very simple to go in there and find out exactly what's going on. If you look at that data, and I say it's been going since the 60s, both the LTI and the recordable rates have come down by huge numbers. In fact, from the very beginning, they're down 99%. Of course, as soon as you say that, you say, well, what about the remaining 1%? Therein lies the challenge. We can never take our eye off this ball. I think some of what Sue was just talking about with regard to human factors will work into how do we aim for exact zero as soon as possible. Yeah, that's a great... I know the industry has done really well compared to other industries, but I like that we don't accept where we are and accept any injury or hurts in the workplace. I think that's a really good culture that has evolved. Thanks for that, Robin. Sue, collaboration with the drilling world, where is there opportunity there in your mind? Well, I think there's several ripe areas of opportunity. The first is human factors. That comes up. Can you introduce human factors? I know we're used to it, but for those who haven't heard that as a buzzword, what does human factors mean? Yeah, okay. I'm not a human factors person, but I'll give it my best shot. No, you don't have to. Human factors is taking into consideration how humans interact in the systems that they're working in and so designing systems with that in mind so that we're trying to design systems that are safer for humans to operate within. When we think about drilling, there are a lot of opportunities for injury. The more that we can think about how to remove humans possibly from as much of the mechanical work as possible, how do we design so that the injuries that we've known and seen in the past, we can try to design those out of the systems. So that's one. On the personal safety front, yeah, we've made a lot of progress in the industry, but we can do more. And I think that's another area of opportunity. If people aren't aware, a few years ago, the SPE put together a report on getting to zero. It's an excellent report on things that we can do within the industry to help reduce and get to zero. And also tied in with that is the work on collaboration for culture. So what kind of cultures are we expecting and tolerating might be another word. So those are three that come to mind for me. And I think collaboration outside is another area, bringing in others. I know we've learned that a lot. Yeah, we do that. Absolutely, we do that. So there's a ton. I mean, you're in the in DSA, Robin. So the automation world has been, I want to say galloping ahead, but there's lots to go in the development of fully automated systems or people being off of rigs. How's that working for safety? Well, it is clearly, as Sue said, getting people out of the way, getting people off the rig for away from some of the big equipment is clearly going to have a benefit. But actually, automation provides its own challenges. I heard recently someone call this the automation conundrum because particularly with the related to human factors, the more a system is, is automated, it's not completely autonomous, and you want some interaction between the human and the system, then the more automation there is to some degree, they'll, in theory, the less connected the human can feel to the system and therefore, it may be less able to intervene when something is required. So the more automation we have, the more we have to think about what are the ergonomics of the situation? How do you manage the user interface so that in this case, the driller feels completely connected? And you talk there about other industries, I seem to recall a while ago that we were learning something, we used to invite people from the airline industry to come and speak and there was a contrast between, I believe it was the two major airline providers, one had both had automated systems, but in one, the manual equipment was still in place. So for example, the automated system moved the joystick, you could see it move and therefore you still felt connected to the system. And I think it's those sort of ergonomic issues that we need to consider when we're looking at how do we maintain connection between the human and the loop. So you're anticipating more haptics and like vibrations or noise? Yeah, possibly. Certainly. And I think a lot of visualization, for example, I know that there's autonomous, I mean, I think that Norse at Ulrich in Norway are explaining with autonomous drilling system whereby there are sensors in the well that are checking what's happening in the well and the system is responding automatically to that. I think if you're the human in that loop, you would want to be able to see what the sensors are seeing. Can you look down home and see, okay, if this system has, for example, detected a pack off, where is that? And what is the system doing about it? And where's the visualization that allows myself as the driller to see what's going on? So I think those sort of interfaces are going to be necessary to allow the human in the loop to stay connected. That's interesting. I mean, I imagine all this stuff going on, I hadn't really thought of it this way. So that's a great insight that there were actually, yes, things look like they could be better with more people at the loop, but actually there's new challenges for us to think about, which I'm sure Sue kind of pulls your team and go, hold on a minute. This is great, but what are we going to do when things go wrong? Which leads me to probably the biggest case we have of critical systems, which is kind of well-controlled as a system. And I know we've been kind of in an MPD world, which brings a lot more control into the system's automation, but where are we as it comes to moving towards a more automated well-controlled system? Robin? Yeah, thanks. So we are moving in that direction. And I think I once placed this question myself at a conference and it was responded to by someone from an operator who said that with some automated systems, you can have them so that if they go wrong, that's fine. You can jump in and you can, for example, move the pipe yourself if you're the driller. But if you were going to automate well control, you'd better make sure that this thing works from day one in a perfect manner. So I think that's one reason why we haven't gone as fast in that direction. But certainly now we do have the sensors available, we do have managed pressure drilling available. And I think what we get back to is again, how do we maintain the connection between whoever's the human in the system? And I think that we come there back to maybe that we need simulation. Again, if I use the airline industry as an analogy, ideally, if the worst case scenario happens, it's not a surprise. In this case, the pilot will have been on an automated system where they have been asked to deal with that situation. And I think the same applies here that we need to have probably training on simulator. I know, for example, OEMs have a lot of simulation systems where they can test and use new equipment. I think the same applies here whereby we put folks on a simulator. And then we do simulate the worst case scenario. So once again, if you find yourself as a human loop, and that happens, then you know how to respond. So I think technology, it does exist. I've always felt that we should perhaps move faster in that direction. And as I say, I think that the human factors again, plays a big part in making sure we get it right. That really opens up that this whole area to understanding because I think people see, you know, and I've seen it for years, lots of automated systems out there, lots of promises of great things. But we're moving towards the technology for sure. We're seeing it more and more in all sorts of applications. But I wonder what would help us to go faster? And it sounds like this disconnect potential is part of it. But what do you think about how do we move faster into drilling operations being more automated? Maybe it's the wrong answer. Maybe we shouldn't. Maybe I'm assuming we should. No, I think we should. In fact, I think now we need to, you know, various companies, OEM service companies and rig companies have now developed systems, for example, on the rig floor where they can retroactively fit automated pipe handling systems. And when you look at the data I referred to earlier with regard to where do injuries take place on the rig or where are the potential incidents on the rig? Most of them, I think almost 50%, maybe more, are between the floor hands and the roustabouts and the rig floor is predominantly the area and pipe handling is predominantly the area where the risks are. But we do now have systems whereby, as I say, we can remotely add robotics to rig floors. And I think retrofit is key because clearly there's an expense here. And if people, if it requires a brand new rig, then the uptake is going to be a lot slower. But now that we have retrofitable systems, I think it moves us in the industry to take full advantage of those. These have been invested in, as I say, by at least two or three companies that we could think of. And therefore, we should take that up and we should start to, I think, insist on the fact that there are more automated systems on rig floors and we do get people out of those red zones, which we know through the statistics are the most dangerous areas. Yeah, that's good. And I know I'm seeing these robotic systems where, you know, more like car manufacturing, where they're actually picking up all the tasks of the humans, which leads me to kind of the way we've been going here, which says we're very focused on injury on the floor, floor hands and pipe decks and that stuff. But are we moving towards a higher risk where, you know, we're going to be using automated systems with the full drilling process? And so are we looking at the potential for incidents? Sue, what are your thoughts on all this? I think that as we see more automation, we're going to definitely be learning from it. And I think that this is an area for this new learning from normal work to help us understand what's happening in these systems. And then if we can get that information shared across the industry, through SPE, that would be great. And for those companies that are making these investments, I encourage them to, as they're bidding on projects, make this known so that they can use that as a competitive advantage. That's good. Well, we do have a question in from online, so I'm going to give you one of those to respond to. So this is from Maxi Naconhead on LinkedIn. So please, please do send questions to us. It helps us focus on the things you're interested in. How do you recommend tracking your supply chains, human factors and due diligence for accountability and reporting purposes? I'll take a stab at that one first. I think one way to help that is if you have, as you're vetting your supply chain, making sure that that's part of your requirements, that you want to see that. That's the first step, because then they'll have to provide you information to demonstrate that they actually are considering it. And if they have any reporting data, you can ask for it. They may not have any, but if they do, it's certainly something to ask for. That's good. Robin, do you have any thoughts? Yeah, I agree. And if they don't, then we should ask why not. I think that you can, if you like, filter your supply chain by those people that do have those sort of systems in place. Yeah, it seems like it's the new question. We need to be asking this because like I say, we've been focused on safety on the floor, but human factors, I would say it's an evolving expertise that we need to grow. Here's another one from Naid's side. How human factors are integrated into the risk management process and how it's measured to gaze at performance and improvement? How is that deployed basically? This is out of my area of expertise. I would invite Naid to join our human factors technical section and ask this of our technical section and start to learn from them. I wouldn't be able to answer that. I think you're right, Sue. It's early days and that's the challenge. For us, as an industry, I think that's probably the message here is there's a shift from an HSES standpoint. We're doing really well. We're moving on. We've been doing all this automation, but probably it's becoming the number one area as human factor because the systems are changing and so then the learning is changing. So yeah, that's a good question. In part, I think there's a collaboration between the, what's HFES? Human factors and ergonomics. And ergonomics, yeah. I think there's a collaboration between the SPE and HFES. Do you do cross between the drilling organizations and HSES? Do you have joint events or how does that work? Or should you? Well, currently I joined, it means that Sue is a member of the drilling advisory committee. Oh, that's good. And that's why, I mean, yeah, because we need that sort of input. I think, as we just said, it keeps coming up. It does. It's a challenge. And I think it's another example actually of where the technical sections of the SPE overlap and probably, and I'd like, I'm going to encourage more collaboration with the technical sections. Yeah, Sue? Yeah, another collaboration that we've seen in the past is the international HSES conferences that are held every couple of years. The IADC has a drilling track as part of that conference as well. So there is an opportunity in when we're developing those conferences to ensure the drilling and the HSES communities are engaged together. We have a drilling conference next month, sorry, next week, right? In Stavanger. Is there an HSE part of that? HSES? There is. I was looking through, there's a, there is at least one session called people and processes. Yeah. Yeah. I remember from, from DSATs in the early days, that's, there was a splinter off where one of the guys who started DSATs went off and went into human factors very quickly. So I think it's, I think it's recognized that, oh, wait a minute, for going down this road, we're going to have some challenges. So that's great. This was, I think that's encouraging for everyone to get involved in this area. If you haven't studied human factors, I know I've seen plenty of speakers at our events from outside the industry and you learn a lot from that. Yes. I actually wonder, because when we've heard the airline guys talking and you think about guys who fly planes or women who fly planes, they, they get rest because of stress. Of course, we're carrying women, but they're stressed in a way that we haven't even really thought about when we're in critical operations. So I just think it's a fascinating area. It is. And that technical section is doing a lot of work and collaboration externally as well. So it's not just human factors, folks within our industry, but we're learning from others as well. Well, great. So unfortunately that is the end of our time. So we have more questions. So if anybody wants to connect, then please get involved with our technical sections. I think that's a great way to get involved. There's always things going on. So thanks Sue and Robin for your insights. That's been really helpful. Thanks audience for, for your watching as well as giving us questions and for joining us. So we'll see you next time. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast.

SPE Live Podcast: How Technology and Innovation Drive Unconventional Resources Development,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE LIVE! Natural Language Processing in the Subsurface and Wells Disciplines. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on April 26th, 2023. And now your moderator, Claude Boudoir. Hello and welcome to this edition of SPE LIVE! on the topic of natural language processing in the subsurface and wells discipline. My name is Claude Boudoir. I am an independent consultant in information technology and knowledge management based near San Francisco. And I'm a member of the SPE Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Section, the SEATS, and I will be the moderator today. This SPE LIVE! session will last 30 minutes and we can take your questions mostly at the end. But feel free to ask questions anytime during the program. If there are clarification questions, we'll try to answer them immediately. When the new DSCA technical section was created last year by merging to other sections, we started planning a newsletter series. And the first of those appeared on December 1st, 2022, there quarterly. The first article of substance in that inaugural issue in December was written by Paul Cleverley. So he had the privilege of being our first author. And he wrote this article whose title was Natural Language Processing in the Subsurface and Wells Disciplines. This article was really a very elaborate 13 page paper with figures and references on this topic of how you can use natural language processing to improve a lot of the work that's being done in the oil and gas industry. So naturally, we wanted to feature Paul in one of these SPE lives and dig deeper into his knowledge of how this particular aspect of artificial intelligence applies to oil and gas. And that's what we aim to do today. So it's now my pleasure to introduce to you our guest, Dr. Paul Cleverley is a geoscientist and a computer scientist by background. He has worked for numerous companies in the IT and energy sectors for the past 30 years. He's based in Oxford in the United Kingdom. He founded an instructive tech startup Infoscience Technologies Limited in 2018, pioneering the use of natural language processing algorithms for the subsurface and geo resource sectors. He also has several unpaid roles, including serving as visiting professor of information science and university at RGU Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen in Scotland. Dr. Cleverley, welcome to this SPE live. Thank you, Claude. Good morning, afternoon, everybody. So I would like to start with basically a background explanation on your part, because some people may not be familiar with, you know, the definition or the scope of natural language processing and why it seems to have recently gained so much popularity. Can you please start with that? Sure. Sure. Well, natural language processing or NLP for short, it's a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with how computers understand human language through voice or the written word. I like to think it's the process of turning unstructured information into structured information. You can think of NLP as mainly split into two really one is statistics. So word patterns learned from text. And secondly, methods based on linguistics rules representations and knowledge like taxonomies. Many real world business problems often require both of these techniques to be used and value is often at the interfaces between many different techniques, some of which we'll discuss today. We all use NLP, we use email, we perform a Google searches, we talk to our conversational assistants like Alexa. NLP is almost omnipresent in a lot of things that we do in the digital world. It's trying to understand the intent of what a person is asking. There's natural language understanding, which is very much about understanding that intent, whether you type in something to Google, or you ask Alexa. There's natural language generation. We've heard a lot about things like chat GPT models that sort of generate new, new text, which you may have seen if you've ever played AI dungeon, which is a text adventure game again with a model like that behind it. From from an organizational oil and gas point of view, I think there's been a growing realization for companies that their insights locked in their unstructured text on the file systems in their archives, which are not in structured databases. There's too much for us to read ourselves. We need machines to try and help us to automate tasks, extract data, summarize information for us, and also detect patterns and anomalies. And if you combine this with recent advances in compute power, algorithms, open source algorithms, some of the deep learning models that you see, there are things I mean, when I was asked to write the article for SP chat GPT hadn't even been launched. So I mean, there are things in NLP that you can do today that you couldn't do last month that you can do last year. It's a very fast moving pace Claude. And so based on that, you know, at what point and how did you come to appreciate the potential of this technology in our domain and especially how it could be applied to subsurface data? Yeah, good question. I did my PhD quite quite late in my career back in 2013. I picked up Python and retaught myself programming. I did that when I was a bit younger. And I conducted interviews with geoscientists and engineers, video observation experiments using stimulants and prototypes to really try and find what NLP techniques people found valuable for what tasks and why. One area that emerged really, which was perhaps poorly met was exploratory search goals. So, you know, if we look at a traditional search engine, you get lists of results when you when you when you type questions. Or if you want an answer such as chat chat GPT, then it's great if you want a specific, you know, results. But if you're sort of exploring, you know, asking questions like, you know, what's the reservoir quality like in, you know, in the Alisi basin? There's not a right answer. Summaries have to be very careful of because they might smooth out important outliers and it could be, you know, that piece of information on page 20 of a PDF that appears 10 pages down in your search results, which actually turns out to be the most interesting in amongst your results. But you'll never know that because you never read that far. So you have to be careful a little bit with these algorithms, you know, because they become a bit of an epistemology. They're how how we come to know things that they curate what we see and therefore influence what we know. So we can catch counteract that with with NLP to take us off the beaten path and, you know, find out some of these more interesting or unusual things in amongst the text as well as the obvious. So following up on that in the article you wrote, the paper you wrote for us in in December, you went pretty quickly into a description of what's called transformer models, which is another phrase that a lot of people are using casually today without necessarily explaining it. But people have heard a lot more about transformer models recently because of the all the news and the hype about chat GPT. So can you briefly explain what a transformer does and how it does it? Sure. If you allow me just to go back a little bit to some of the sort of fundamentals. I mean, first, back in 1957, coined this wonderful phrase, you can find a word's meaning by the company it keeps. So words that occur together or in similar contexts tend to be more closely related. So we can build probability distribution of words as numerical vectors using some of these philosophies. So in simple terms, we can create a word vector for any word that represents the words that occur in proximity to that word from everyday training data where it's on the Internet or our own company data. And then we can take these vectors and do things like cosine similarity between them. And the closer they are, the more similar we can infer. So words like the Internet and say the World Wide Web will have very close cosine similarities, their vectors, because the words mentioned around those are very similar. So we can use this for a range of things. I did a bit of a study on the Society of Petroleum Engineers papers itself, 70,000 of them. If you take a word, permeability, the most commonly occurring word to permeability in the SP is relative because next to it or within the same sentence. But if you look at geological literature like the Geological Society of London, it's porosity. Also words like fracture, very associative with permeability in the SP. Geological not so, it's more related to faults. So you've got these subtle elements even within different disciplines and training data. But we can use these patterns to train a model, you know, to predict for almost any word what word follows it for a given context. And this is powerful, can be used for all sorts of things, identifying analogues for reservoir drilling geological purposes, for example, just from the patterns in text may serve some analogues we hadn't considered costing a bit of a wider net, perhaps than the normal. So you fast forward all of this to the latest computer techniques. So I like to think of it as just a very complex word co-occurrence on massive amounts of text on the internet that we've all helped create. We're now indirectly teaching these statistical models to create this probabilistic model to create a relationship to some extent between all words. So the transformer model uses mathematical techniques called attention or termed attention, first described by some of the Google brain researchers and essentially is a deep neural network that learns context associating word with every other word in the sentence. So you specifically an embedded vector containing positional information is fed to encoder for some algebraic functions. The decoder output is enriched embedded vectors. A couple of things that this approach that previous approaches haven't done is it uses long range dependency of words. So it's very, it can predict how even quite distant words relate to each other, has a significant context window. And these techniques also lend themselves to parallel processing. So you're seeing these models just getting bigger and bigger using more and more training data. And then we can take these models, fine tune them for downstream tasks specifically for say summarization or for chat bots for translation and so forth. It can be very useful for businesses as many have found out. So you mentioned in this explanation a couple of corpora of texts. You mentioned, of course, the 70,000 SPP papers. You mentioned the British Geological Society corpus of papers. What are you mentioned in your article abandonment report, these abandonment reports as being a source of rich information. I can also think of drilling reports. Are there other things you've been using in your work that give you the training data or the information you need to make the model work? Yeah, I think I mean you can use these models, you know, straight off the shelf and actually they've been trained on the internet and apply them to company content. In my NLP projects tend to typically use the office documents that companies have PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, that might be on the file systems or results of large scanning projects or document management systems in SharePoint. Not necessarily just to build statistical models, use other techniques that we may come onto. I've done some work with emails. So, yeah, I mean, you can do lots of things with this. You can extract data. You can detect contradictions. This is always interesting when you find contradictions in text, the basis of the research method and literature review, which we do in oil and gas as well, of course. I mean, for example, did some extraction on well completion reports, taking out things like propane, volumes, duration, acid data, correlating that then with data outside of the unstructured corpus to calibrate, say production. And then kind of with with improved completion design. So it's not just using just text. You can also correlate and bring in data outside of that. Probably also talking general in general terms, I've been using some of my algorithms are sort of developed for things like geotagging, for example, that allow you to position documents on a map. Really from scanning projects, millions of documents, bring in word sense disambiguation. So to take an example, you've got to say, Azara, you come across Azara, you know, it could be someone's name, could be a company, it could be a city. If it's a city, is it the city in Spain or Argentina? So when you're you're trying to really pinpoint in a laser like way, these these elements, word sense disambiguation is a key part of NLP for any any word which is polysemic. In other words, it has has more than one meaning. So that when you have a large amount of text, that's a key element. And that that hints that various forms of knowledge representation, including ontologies and taxonomies and glossaries, etc, become become really important. And you've just, I guess, explained a question I was going to ask you, which is about the importance of these things. When we look at the geoscientist or the petroleum engineer who's trying to use one of these models in order to derive new inferences, let's say, how do you interact with such of these models? Is it the kind of stuff that we've seen in the press recently about chat GPT where if you ask a silly question, you may get a stupid answer? Or is it a, you know, what's the process of actually operating this model and making it give you some useful insight? Sure. I mean, there are very different types of models. We may we may come onto graphs. But, yeah, I mean, chat GPT is a hot topic. I mean, you're going to have that real time sort of question answer aspect that's going to be quite useful for companies, whether it's on, you know, operational information or manuals, a way for people to interact with information in a much more intuitive way, perhaps. And they don't in the past with picklists or, you know, SQL like sort of statements. So I think there might be some targeted sort of subsurface specific mechanisms for this. We also, of course, interact with the products of things like transformer models. I mean, if you've ever used Google or Bing, you're consuming the output from transformers. If you want meaningful file titles, you know, things like look on a project and you've got things like final PDF or 10045 PDF, you know, we can generate meaningful, meaningful titles. So there are there are sort of direct interaction with the model, but then also the products. We're probably also moving to more natural, natural language type querying of structured databases and tables as well and graphs, which is much, which is very exciting because the moment interacting with, you know, some of these things can be can be a little bit cumbersome and not not not potentially tremendously exciting information. Visualization is another way, I think, to cope with all of this information. I spent quite a bit of time on this, you know, stacking up all of the mentions of a concept of interest in text, including the outliers, the edge cases, you know, looking at the sentiment like this potential source rocks, you know, by area and geological age or drilling problems by formation, the quality of casing that we can extract out from text spatially. So by clustering some of this, this data, we might even, you know, come across some some interesting and overlooked trends. For example, taking, you know, word vectors around bleaching carbonate cements, clay minerals, iron precipitation, maybe clustering that plotting that against vectors for different mythologies. We we could come up with potentially overlooked fluid flow pathways in a basin. These little latent patterns hit and hidden in, you know, all of our text that, you know, could be could be knowledge in hiding in in plain sight. And in your article, you did mention that some of these techniques had allowed you to discover things you did not expect. Right. Yeah, indeed. I mean, I mean, we're talking about sort of, you know, graphs as an example. You know, you think of graph as as as being of nodes and edges so we can install we can store it into relationships between events, you know, entities, concepts that don't necessarily explicitly exist. The graphs can be data driven. So unlike sort of relational database, the schema more or less reflects the NLP logic of, you know, perhaps what your Python algorithms are extracting. And we're familiar with graphs and page rank in Google around, you know, each node is a web page and an edge is a link from one page to another. You know, Facebook friend of a friend, you know, whose friend of a friend plays a guitar. We can do the same with geoscience and engineering, you know, which wells in this area penetrated this formation with casting these sorts of types of things and applying to sort of, you know, geoscience and engineering discovery. We can take these mathematical graphs and, you know, in a way there's a visual representation of the geology and engineering linked to a reservoir or play with the wells known to interact with that. And it might be much more fun to and useful to interact with that using a chat GPT type interface to explore the different pathways and query that graph. So again, you know, another example of taking different NLP approaches, you know, statistics and linguistic and putting them together for for a potential solution in terms of finding new knowledge. I've got some examples. I've, you know, been doing creating sort of knowledge graphs with some of my algorithms as an instance graph rather than a reference graph. So it's important to me how many times that edge between two concepts is detected within within the text. We take a simple example. As one company found there was some lower Cretaceous source rockling area that they weren't weren't aware of. And this is very simple sort of technique. This particular example of like the ABC technique. So in one document there was a mention of high TUC with a rather lesser known lithostratigraphic unit. So the high TUC concept A, the lithostrat units concept B. Then in another document, there was mention of this lithostrat unit concept B and then an age, which is concept C. But in this quite large, you know, several thousand documents, it was never stated that there was effectively a lower Cretaceous potential source rock. But you can infer that through the the ABC type rule. And these techniques have been around for quite a while. There's a nice study where links between Reynolds disease and fish oil and also magnesium deficiency and migraines was actually predicted in a same ABC type technique. Literature based discoveries is one way to call it. And these these were never explicitly stated, but the knowledge was was there. Latent within the text, almost again hiding in plain sight. And they were later proved empirically. And there's many other examples that if we put all our text together, there's the potential for new business and scientific discoveries. If we if we know how to look. So that's the that's a grand challenge. And that's the grand benefit you can get from this. Let's in a few minutes that are left, let's let's talk now about what people and companies should do concretely to to benefit from this. So one question is, is what should an oil and gas company do in order to discover new important information from the mass of textual data and documents they hold? Another part of the question is, what should an oil and gas professional learn? What are the courses and resources, et cetera, they need to go? And then we have an audience question, which is the biggest challenge for a PhD student is data. Can you please explain where we can get subsurface data? So can you can you address, you know, these three aspects, you know, the learning access to the data and what a company should do in whichever order you want? Right. OK. Yeah. Memory challenge. I think, you know, some companies, it's is making sure you've got like a text lake of your unstructured text, NLP ready so you can apply as many algorithms as many times to it as you like. So remove any barriers to iterations. I think, you know, one thing that I sometimes observe is, you know, it's difficult to do the more iterations that you can do, the better the result you'll get. So you want to try and remove barriers to that and think of, you know, having an environment where, you know, you might have a traditional search index, which is document focused. You might second you might have a statistical language model which is corpus focused. And thirdly, you may have a knowledge graph which is more concept focused and you put those three together and they support a whole variety of how you might interrogate information. I also think, you know, maybe slightly controversial, but data scientists really have no idea whether the output from an NLP project is valuable to the business. So the challenge is to bring in those geoscientists, engineers, commercial analysts, managers, and other business people to be as close to this environment and get that iteration going the time invested to it. If it becomes a bit of a batch process, then you're likely to get, you know, quite, quite suboptimal approaches. And I will also say, you know, we, I mean, Agile is supposed to encourage this, but, you know, we shouldn't frame projects to an inch of their life. You know, we, we, we, we never, we sometimes we're afraid to admit it, but a lot of the best discoveries are somewhat accidental or unexpected. So, you know, we just need to experiment and go in with some loose framing and then, you know, see what emerges and, you know, quite often what you end up finding and what's valuable is quite different to what you, you started with. I mean, in terms of training people learn in different ways. I bought a bunch of Python books and I never opened them, because there's so much information on the available on the internet. My style of learning is learn by doing. So, you know, write something that doesn't work, find out why it doesn't work, learn that way. Other people have sort of different styles, but there was a host of online. I wouldn't necessarily recommend any particular one. I think there's a lot of good courses if you do some searches for that. I'm trying to think what else, Claud, have I not answered? So, so how does a PhD student who is doing some research, how does he get the data or how does she get the data? Well, there's been a lot of public data put into the public domain. The Volvo data set in Norway, for example, contains both data and documents is an excellent example of lots of well files and information increasingly national data repositories are actually making the information in government's licensing rounds sort of available. There are, you know, public sources, geological surveys are making their information available. It is a bit challenging in the oil and gas compared to say the medical sector where you've got PubMed, where a lot of the medical literature is sponsored by government. So it's all released into public domain. And there is still quite a lot of, you know, geoscience and engineering information behind sort of paid firewalls. But there's still quite a bit, you know, out there, public sets you dig around. And if anyone, I can send some references after people feel free to contact me to get yourself going. So we've got several other questions that have come in and we're not going to have time to take all the questions. So I think we can certainly look at channeling this dialogue farther. There's a question about the potential for transfer learning. There's one about training bias and how we mitigate the training bias, especially in the oil and gas domain. And there's a question about the quality of data, of course, which is a prevalent thing. So we're going to have to sort of move on to the conclusion very, very quickly. But I just rattled off several topics. Do you have a quick comment on those, Paul? Yeah, I mean, sometimes you've got what you've got. So if you've got to scan documents, then you need to adapt your NLP to cope with the fact there'll be a lot of mistakes in the text. I think, you know, things like language models, statistical models, they're a breakthrough. They are a big piece in the puzzle, but they're not the whole jigsaw. And they don't work in a lot of different contexts. So, you know, don't go in, oh, I must use this method to address these particular problems. You know, think, think, I suggest think, think quite broadly. Bias is obviously intrinsic in almost everything we do. We actually use NLP to help us with bias. We can look at all our proposals and plans and maybe the sentiment in those and then compare them with what actually happened and reveal systemic biases in the way our organization maybe thinks. So I think as long as you're aware, that's the first step to catering with any bias. But your training set has to be as close as possible to the information that you're going to apply it to. And that's obviously something to bear in mind if you've got models based on movie reviews or internet content and you're applying it to very technical information. Having said that, I've used plenty of generic models and they've performed pretty, pretty good against some pretty messy, you know, drilling reports, for example. All right, so we could certainly go on for probably another hour if we had the time. But unfortunately, we don't have the time. Do you have any final words of wisdom that you would like to leave us with? Well, I don't know about words of wisdom, but I would say, you know, sometimes, you know, in amongst all this text, you know, to see the meaningful, you have to remove the obvious. Wow, that's profoundly philosophical. Thank you. That was a great, that was a great final statement. So that's all we have time for today. Thank you so much for your insights. I think this was absolutely fascinating. And it's amazing that it, you know, you wrote that back in November. And then since then, we've only been hearing about chat GPT every day. So it's clear that you're at the top of this, this trend and making it useful for our industry. I can only add a recommendation that everyone go and read Paul's article, which was in the December 2022 issue again of the the SCA technical section newsletter. As a reminder, the title of Paul's paper was natural language processing in the subsurface and wealth disciplines. And it starts on page five of that issue after the sort of initial preliminaries. Thank you for joining us today, Paul. And thank you for our audience for having joined us and we'll see you next time. Thank you, Claude. Thanks, everybody. Bye bye. Bye, everyone.

SPE Live Podcast: Separation; Design vs Reality,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the December 2023 episode of the SPE Presidents Podcast, creating our energy future with SPE President Terry Palish. And now your moderator, SPE Regional Director North America, Simeon Eburi. Hello, I'm Simeon Eburi, SPE Regional Director North America and Reservoir Management Advisor with Chevron. I'm pleased to join the 2024 President Terry Palish on his monthly podcast to talk about the benefit of joining and being involved with the local SPE section. Thank you for inviting me to join you on this podcast. As the Regional Director, I'm passionate about the sections and the work they do, as I know you are, Terry. Well, thank you, Simeon. And first, look, I just want to thank you for joining us today and being a part of the episode. You know, I asked you to join because I do know your passion and of course your experience at the Gulf Coast section. And, you know, my goal today is I just want to ensure our members recognize how being active in their local section can help their professional development. So, you know, I just thought that you would be the perfect host. You know, I believe that when most people, both members and external, think about SPE, they typically think about the local section. That's what most are exposed to. So I kind of consider the local section the front lines of our society. The sections, you know, they're key to SPE's mission of connecting. We'll probably talk a little bit about that more later in more detail. But, you know, I just want to focus our members on, you know, how they can benefit by connecting to their local section or student chapter of their students. Because I think the local sections can impact not only their education and career, but their energy future. I agree with you, Terry. Sections are the front lines. And I think you're right. I was very involved with my local section in Houston, Texas, long before I was the original director or in the SPEI board. But for people who don't know what are SPE sections, let's start there. What are sections and what do they do? Well, why don't we start with a few statistics? You know, we have over 200 sections worldwide. They're located in 85 countries. So wherever you're located, there should be a section near you. You know, the first section was the Mid-Continent section in Tulsa in 1917. So over 100 years ago, it was actually established before SPE was incorporated. The first international section was about 40 years later, the Western Venezuela section in Maracaibo, Venezuela. One of the most recent sections is the Central Ukraine section in Kiev and established in 2022. So we continue to add sections. We also continue to at times reinstate sections that may have fallen behind. This year, we've reinstated the Libya section, the Tunisia section. I was actually at the the opening of the Tunisia section, which was a lot of fun. And our sections are wide ranging in size. So the two largest sections are the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and your Gulf Coast section. They have well over 8,000 members. But what's really interesting is that the average SPE section size is over 300, but the median is just is under 150. So what that means is we have a lot of sections that are smaller than 150 members. And so it really kind of takes us to that idea of being the grassroots. Each of the sections operate independently. I kind of call them semi-autonomous. They're local in their local area. They're also each unique in that they respond really to the needs of their local section members and the local community. They provide technical exchange, networking opportunities, and of course, they engage locally with the community. So, like I said, I think they're the grassroots of the society. They're really the face of SPE at the local level. Thank you, Shatari, for sharing these statistics about global sections. With SPE being a global society, I can see where the sections covering the globe are important for the mission of SPE. But let me ask you a question on that. How are new sections created or established? Can anyone create a section around the world? Yeah, it's not too terribly difficult. I mean, we encourage members in areas that aren't being served by a local section to create a section. It takes really a minimum of 25 professional members. So you need some critical mass. All those members, of course, need to reside in the geographic area where they want to create a local section. And then they need to basically elect their board. They typically need a minimum of five board members, including the chairperson, program chair, a membership chair, secretary, and treasurer. So that's really the process. And I'm sure you've been a part of those processes before. But if you're a member and you're in an area of the world that doesn't have a section that's being serviced, that's the process by which you get established. Yeah, thanks for sharing that, because I know there's probably people who will be members of sections for a long time and probably don't remember how a section was created. Staying on the topic of sections, I've heard you say you've visited quite a few sections and chapters around the world. Also, that is one of your favorite things to do as a president. Can you expand on that? Where have you been? Why are they the heart of the mission of SBE? Well, why don't I take your second question first, Simeon? You know, I believe strongly that the section enables us to fulfill our mission of connecting our members. You know, our mission really can be stated very simply as connecting our members to technology, connecting our members to other members and connecting our members to the external stakeholders. And I think that the SP local section is at the heart of that. So as far as connecting members to technology, you know, as a local section, they typically put together technical talks. They bring in speakers, local, maybe not from other areas. They give technology talks. They may put on a local event, maybe a symposium, some sort of workshop or something like that. Of course, they bring in distinguished lectures provided by SPI. So that's how they connect to our members to technology. When it comes to connecting our members to other members, of course, you can do that at the monthly meetings or the periodic meetings whenever the section gets together. But they also have socials. They may have other events for networking, maybe a golf tournament or a clay shoot or all. I mean, sections do a whole host of things to help members connect and network and collaborate. And then last, and the one that I think is sometimes overlooked, the impact that our local sections have on the external stakeholders. You know, they are in our local communities and they do our sections when you read their annual reports, they do a tremendous amount of philanthropic work. I was actually looking through fiscal year 2022, and I added up our sections across the world gave over a million dollars total in scholarship money to students. And so they do that support. They may support a student chapter. All student chapters need a sponsor. They support the local community in a wide variety of ways, food banks, shelters, things like that. So, you know, this is one of the reasons why I enjoy visiting the sections and the student chapters as well, because I get to meet the members who are in the trenches that are, you know, they're working hard for SPI and their local community. They're typically passionate. They're passionate about our society. They're passionate about SP, but they're also passionate about our industry. And, you know, quite frankly, that's contagious. I'll give you a couple of examples. One of my first visits as incoming president was with the Ecuador section in December of last year, about a year ago, where we celebrated their 30th anniversary as being a section. And it was a lot of fun to meet the local leadership, the minister, some of the local companies. In February, I actually got to attend the Oklahoma City section Mardi Gras. That's a wonderful evening fundraiser. They raised funds for local boys club. You know, they have a lot of fun, but at the same time, raise funds for a good cause. In September, I was at the Aberdeen section. They did something interesting there. I was there in conjunction with Offshore Europe and the Aberdeen section put on a half day seminar for local high school guidance counselors, which was really interesting because what they did was they explained, you know, the importance, not just the importance of our industry, but the future, the future jobs that are going to be available and the type of technologies and things that people are going to have to work on and really kind of help them push people into STEM programs, but also help those guidance counselors guide high school students. To move to our industry that I mean, included a tour of the show floor. And so I heard a lot of great feedback on that. Where else? I went to the Tunisia section, as I mentioned before, for their reinstatement. They were putting on an African energy security summit, which was really interesting. It was very well put together, and they were excited about getting reestablished there. I mean, Simien, I could go on and on. You've probably got way more examples than I do, but I just sometimes wish I could bottle the excitement and convey it to all of our members in the industry. Very interesting theory. Thank you for sharing all the sections you visited and the impact those sections have on their local community and the passion that you can clearly see and feel from visiting those sections. SP to me feels like a big family. We have SP membership in common. And when you go and talk to different members across the world, you feel that common ground in the SP membership. So tell me a bit more about your SP membership. You've been a SP member for over 40 years. What made you want to go to the SP? Tell me a bit more about your SP membership. You've been a SP member for over 40 years. What made you join SP and when did you make the decision to volunteer? Wow, that's an interesting question. You know, I think if you talk to most members, a lot of members are going to credit their involvement and leadership with SP sections as instrumental in their careers. I know we've talked about it before. I know your involvement in the Gulf Coast section is very similar to mine. And, you know, I'm sure you have similar stories. But like most, I joined SP when I was in college. I joined, of course, the student chapter at the time. And to be quite honest, I joined because I wanted to get something on my resume and ultimately get a job. But, you know, over the years, what I've gotten out of the local section as I've joined the professional ranks has evolved. And it's really evolved with what my job was and my needs and my professional needs. You know, initially, I would call myself an attender, probably the same as a lot of SP members. You know, I attended local section meetings whenever the topic was something that I thought would help me in my particular job. I might go to a golf tournament or some social to network and really have some fun. But it's interesting as I moved from ARCO to Carbo, I began to kind of change my focus because I realized really the benefits of networking and really looking for potential clients and educating people on what our company did. So I kind of made a decision that I was going to start attending all the local meetings, all the local events that I could possibly go to because I needed to I wanted to network. And I met so many more people. It was just amazing. And this is then when I guess I started volunteering. And to be clear, I didn't just set out one day and say, I'm going to volunteer. I probably should have, but I didn't. But really, my first volunteering work happened because somebody asked me to, you know, two things kind of happened at the same time at the local section. Danny Bell, who was the education committee chair, asked me if I would serve on that committee. Eventually, I was asked to serve as a program chair. And then finally, as the section chair, at the same time, I was asked by a car Montgomery to serve on the drilling and completions award committee. That was an international committee. So it was it was just really interesting that as I began participating more, more people were asking me to volunteer. And the good thing about it was I said yes. I think many times we tend to say no, or not sure we have time. But for me, it's been time well spent. So, you know, just to kind of tie up this decision, you know, for me personally, this is also where I began developing leadership skills. You know, work leading the Dallas section, leading some of the committees, of course, leading ATC, all those things, you know, kind of continue to feed off each other. And, you know, one of the things I always like to tell students and young members is, you know, I was a leader in the Dallas section long before I was the vice president at Carbo. But certainly that professional soft skill work is what drove a lot of my success outside of the S.P.E. I like that, and I know you share some of the important things about volunteering. One, someone has to ask you sometimes that that helps. And then, of course, if the answer is yes, that that makes a perfect match. So thanks for sharing that. And I will share my side is a similar story, actually very similar S.P.E. journey. I joined in college as well for the same reasons. I think you joined. But then after that, I became involved with the Gulf Coast section in Houston as a young professional member. Chair the Gov the young professional committee. And then coincidentally, similar to your story, Terry, I also chair the education committee in the Gulf Coast section and eventually chair the Gulf Coast section. And that led me to become a regional director and board member at S.P.E. level. Now, you did mention about leadership skills and soft skills. I know a lot of people connect S.P.E. a lot with with technical knowledge, technical dissemination, and it's easy to make the connection with the technical side of S.P.E. You joined the drilling study group or the completion study group, and that's linked directly to your career, your profession. Can you share one or two examples on leadership skills and soft skills that you develop or refine while participating in your local section or an S.P.E. in general? And how have those soft skills and leadership skills helped you professionally and throughout the rest of your journey in S.P.E.? Yeah, well, that's a big question. You know, I think about it. I think I agree 100 percent. First of all, for a lot of people, they think of S.P.E. as technical dissemination. But I think a lot of people also tend to forget about their soft skills. I mean, we're engineers. We would like to work problems and be technical. But, I mean, your soft skills are a huge part of your professional journey. So for me personally, you know, first of all, I began writing papers back in the mid 90s after I'd been in industry for about 10 years. And I'd written several papers by time I made it to the Dallas section. And one at the time when I was on the education committee, the Dallas section chair, who's again, Danny Bell, he asked me, you know, hey, you've written a lot of papers. I think it'd be good to educate our local section on how to write papers and how to write abstracts. And so he said, could you put together, you know, maybe a half day seminar just that we could offer up to the local members? And so I developed a half day seminar just to explain to people the process and how to write the abstract and how to get it accepted and things like that. And what was interesting is that turned into I actually gave that talk at a Gulf Coast section meeting. People heard about it. And now it's actually something it's a training webinar that we give in conjunction with ATC every year. I just gave it last September this past September. So for me, I mean, it wasn't I didn't set out to hone a soft skill. But by doing this, writing those papers initially, then it led to presenting. It led to teaching me how to assemble a training class. It taught me how to present and work interactively with the students in the class. And so, I mean, from a soft skill standpoint, it was it was amazing. And maybe I'll give you another, of course, on the leadership side. According to the Dallas section board certainly taught me how to lead it. And, you know, leading a volunteer group of volunteers, you know, they're not being paid to do what they do. That's different than than leading at work. It takes some additional skills. And so, you know, you have to learn how to motivate a team. You have to learn how to strive together for a common goal. And, you know, our goal was to win the president's award. I think it's a goal for a lot of sections. But, you know, that that in the end turned into leadership skills that I then transferred immediately over to my work at Carbo and things like that. So I guess those are two examples, Simeon, of how I think soft skills or leadership skills can be developed through your involvement at SPE and in particular the local section. That's great, Terry. I completely agree about the soft skills, leadership skills examples that you share because it is different. It's about influential leadership. We don't have a performance review responsibility or authority or bonus authority. And so you do focus on just shared goals, shared common, common goals for the for the section for your committee. And I think you say that very well. So I'm going to move on to another aspect, something I want you to expand on. One of the analogies you like to use, Terry, and even highlighted in some of your previous podcasts, is the gym membership versus SPE membership. What specific section programs do you think benefit young professionals or those seeking professional development? Well, you're right. The gym membership analogy, I just love it because the more you put into that gym membership, the more you get out of it. And an SP membership is the same way. So the more you put in, the more you get out. And, you know, I think that as we go forward as students and young professionals, you're going to need to really take care of four important items. If you want to create your energy future and your future in our industry, first you need to learn, you need to participate, you need to volunteer, and you need to learn. And I think sections provide the opportunities for all four. I think they're obvious, but let's just kind of talk about them. The engaging, you have to engage in lifelong learning. I know that's a cliche, but technology is changing so fast in our industry. You have to, in order to stay up with things, you have to continue to learn. And again, the sections put on technical talks, the SP provides three distinguished lectures every year to each section, which are experts in our industry that come from all over the globe. So you can build your local technical skills. You can broaden your horizons. Participating. You have to participate somewhere. And I think that your local section provides you the opportunity to network and to collaborate. You know, we're not going to solve our problems in a vacuum. We need to be able to collaborate with others. And I bet you've had this discussion as well, but I've heard many people who have actually said they've gotten their next job at the local section by networking. So you can't overemphasize the networking and collaboration side. Volunteering. You know, volunteering teaches you how to work with others for what I call, you know, a common purpose. And again, at the section level, that's what we do. You know, we don't just put on technical events, but we put on things for the community. And that'll provide not just professional fulfillment, but also personal fulfillment, you know, of working together and helping your community, maybe raising funds for scholarships. I mean, in the end, we talk about the positive light or the negative light on our on our industry. And this is one of the ways we can put a positive light on things. And then lastly, as I kind of said before, if you do all those things, somebody is going to ask you to lead something. And I want to encourage you to say yes. The sections are they run themselves. They have their own leadership, their own bank accounts, put on their own events. So, you know, work together on a and lead at the section level. So, you know, I think by participating and volunteering and leading at your local section, you know, it's open numerous doors of opportunity for me. And I think it will be for you if you put the time and effort into it like you would a gym membership. You know, I was one of the things I always encourage students to do when they get their first job. The first thing I want you to do is go join your local section. And that's why, because if you do that, then you're on your way to creating your energy future. Thank you, Terry. This is great. This is very important for student and young professionals and section members to know. I think you described the volunteering, the value volunteering. Well, this is the image of SBE in the local sections and then they work the sections do in the communities. Very impactful. I remember my first volunteering event in the section. I was the Houston Arboretum. We're just planting trees and now looking back, that was a selfless act to just do something for the betterment of the environment or betterment of the city that I am. And I think that that's an example that most people can probably find many, many opportunities in their section to volunteer. So, Terry, it's been great to talk to you today. Are you planning to talk about next month? What are you planning to talk about next month? Well, let me just shout out a quick reminder for the awards that are open. The nomination site, the portal, excuse me, is open for nominating your colleagues for regional and national awards. So that'll go on for about another month. So I encourage everybody to go to sp.org and nominate well-deserving colleagues, recognize for their work in the industry, service, things like that. As far as next month goes, you know, of course, this month we talked about the regional sections and I want to move now from the regional level to the technical sections. Technical sections, a lot of people don't necessarily understand and have not seen and been a part of, but we'll dive a little deeper into how SP can help us collaborate on a more global level via our technical sections. So that's what we'll talk about. And I just want to say, Simeon, I really appreciate you taking the time to be a part of the podcast this month. And I want to thank you not only for your service on the board, but also all your involvement over the Gulf of the Gulf Coast section. You know, you're a good example of someone who's creating their energy future. So thank you very much. Thank you, Terry. We hope you have enjoyed this edition of the S.P.E. President's Podcast, Creating Our Energy Future with Terry Palish. New episodes are posted at the beginning of each month, complete with transcripts, on the Journal of Petroleum Technology website at jpt.spe.org."
SPE Live Podcast: Causal Inferencing for Subsurface Engineering Applications,"Welcome to the SPE podcast. I'm Jason Notouris. We have something new and exciting set up for this episode. As SPE ventures into new arenas of digital content, we've begun streaming live simulcasts on our social media platforms. That's on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. One recent broadcast brought together a collection of writers from SPE magazine's JPT, that's the Journal of Petroleum Technology, and a group of people who have been working on the project for a long time. We're excited to introduce Jason Notouris. Before we hand it over to the editorial staff, I wanted to quickly remind everyone that you can learn more about our magazines by visiting spe.org. From there, it's pretty easy to navigate to the digital content of your choice. Of course, you can also bookmark that site for quicker access for future visits. Okay, here you go. Recorded on Tuesday, 15 April 2020, the next voice you'll hear is Trent Jacobs, moderating SPE's first live editorial roundtable. I hope everyone tuning in today is being safe and healthy. Today we're trying something new. We're doing a live chat with editors from JPT and the oil and gas facilities. We're going to be spending the next half hour or so with you, highlighting some of the most recent reports that are in OGF and JPT. We're going to give you also a preview of some of the things that we're working on in the next couple of weeks. We're going to touch on OPEC Plus Agreement, which is sort of the big topic of the day and its potential impacts. Brian Balboa, an editor with oil and gas facilities, is going to talk to us about what the industry has in terms of cost cutting, if there's any more room to go. Judy Federer is going to give us a high level view of the offshore arena. And Stephen Rassenfos is going to end us with a spotlight on three new drilling innovations that might help that segment of the market. So first, we're going to just dive into the OPEC Plus Agreement and get some of those highlights out of the way. This agreement sort of became formalized on Sunday. It's a historic deal. It's the largest agreement. It's the largest cuts that OPEC Plus has ever made. And it ends a costly price war that, as we know, began early March and has resulted in a lot of chaos in the oil and gas industry. So the things to keep in mind with this cut is that it's 9.7 million barrels a day. The cuts do not take place until May 1st. And the baseline for the largest two members of OPEC Plus, Russia and Saudi Arabia, they're going to start their cuts at 11 million barrels a day, which is significant since Saudi Arabia especially is already producing over 12 million. Both will go down to 8.5 million a day. And these cuts, though, this 9.7, this does not last for long. They're going to loosen up in June and shrink to 5.8 million barrels a day until December. And those will translate into further cuts that go down to 5.8 million in January 2021 to 2022. Mexico created a little bit of drama here holding up the agreement. This was sort of what added a little bit of a twist to the overall deal. They were asked to make a cut of 400,000 barrels a day, but they only agreed to 100,000 barrel a day cut and said that the US was going to pick up the slack there on 250,000. So the mechanisms in place for the United States to join this are not clear yet. But that's what got the deal through in the end. The big question, though, is will it make a difference? The EIA had a report out today stating that April's demand is now 29, or I'm sorry, 24 to 29 million barrels a day off from year over year levels. So it's only a dent. And what we've seen is that the crude markets, WTI and Brent, have not responded too favorably. But what analysts think is that this will stem the the bleeding over over the long term. So obviously these cuts are going to be a big story and something for us to keep an eye on. And we're going to we're going to be covering that story a little bit more as it develops in JPT. But I want to throw it over to Brian now. He's been looking at the cost cutting that the industry has been going through. This has been another huge story. Brian Balboa is the associate editor of our online publication, Oil and Gas Facilities. Brian, you've been covering projects and investments in the upstream world. What has stood out to you the most during this period? So, Trent, what really stands out right now is how little companies have to work with when it comes to reducing costs. Now, when you look at the last downturn that took place from 2014, 2016, companies were forced to reduce costs and streamline operations across the board. Since then, most of the industry has actually kept those cost cutting measures in place. So, you know, they're operating lean as it was coming into this pandemic, so to speak. That's made it even more difficult for companies to cut costs this time around. So I wrote a feature last week on OGF where energy research groups Wood-Bakensian and Ristad Energy actually outlined this very issue. Looks like your mic is cut there, but let me dive into that right there. So some areas, Trent, that Wood-Bakensian and Ristad think that are most likely to be cut, you know, obviously no area is safe right now. In the case of Wood-Bakensian, the areas that are the easiest to cut right now are going to be the short cycle investment or the lower 48 states. You can see the chart right there and pre-final investment decision projects. Now, the easiest way to actually cut capex spending right now, according to Wood-Bakensian experts, is really not to spend and to defer. So Wood-Bakensian, they actually lower their 2020 global capex estimate from just under $500 billion to under $400 billion. But again, you know, you have to note with the wide range of uncertainty right now, risk is very much still to the downside. When you look at Ristad's analysis on global E&P, global exploration and production, they said operators will only be able to cut supply chain costs by up to 12% this year. So about 9% of those cuts relate to service prices and 3% to efficiency improvements. You can see the screen up here too. They expect similar cuts within the shell industry at 16%, similar cuts offshore at 12%, and other onshore at $1.5 billion. Now, looking at that, I mean, they're so able to cut costs, but it's really not a lot compared to the previous downturn in 2015, 2016, when the industry saw a reduction of 37%, as outlined there. The shell industry back then in particular was able to reduce costs by nearly half back then at 45%. So really not a lot of room to trim fat, as they say. Yeah, thanks, Brian. Still getting used to the mute button here, but yeah, no good point. I mean, I think what that says to me is it shows that really the industry hadn't fully recovered from the last downturn in 2014 and 2015. And so this is going to come with an extra sting. What are some of the other things that you're looking at right now and have coming out in the near term? So right now I'm actually looking at storage space. There's really not a lot of storage space out there. I mean, you have an overabundance of supply, weak demand. We've seen how oil prices have actually crashed at a record pace. I mean, you just talked about that with the OPEC Plus story, but kind of on a positive note, though, one thing I'm working on right now that I'm looking at is a white paper that came out of the University of Houston. And we've seen how hard this has hit the oil and gas industry in terms of job cuts, hiring freezes, and work furloughs. But a recent study out of U of H and two energy associations found that a majority of workers in the energy sector actually prove of how their employers are handling the challenges brought on by COVID-19. I've had a chance to look at the survey. I've had a look at it. It covers a lot of ground. And almost 90% of the employees that were surveyed said their companies have responded to the pandemic effectively based on three issues. Number one being whether the company provided clear and honest information about the issue. Number two, whether they provided support to help workers juggle work responsibilities along with family responsibilities. And number three, the extent to which a company has actually been prepared for the prospect of a global viral pandemic. I mean, you know, most of the world is actually working from home. A lot of the world actually. I mean, I'm juggling work responsibilities here, not just family responsibilities as well. So it's something that, you know, I can definitely identify with. I'm sure a lot of people that are on this webinar can identify with as well. So, I mean, looking at it, employees also indicated, though, in the survey that their companies must invest even more in employee health and well-being should this continue to grow. And again, they feel that companies should be growing projects to support these local communities as well. So even though companies are having a tough go at it with budget cuts and job cuts, employees do feel that their companies are doing what they can. So that story will be out sometime this week on OGF. OK, well, thank you, Brian, for that update. We're going to move to Judy Federer, who's the J.P.T. technology editor. Judy, you with us? Yes. Hi, Trent. First, first, apologies for scratchy voice and any coughing. I do not have coronavirus, but my mother in Houston brings with it allergies. So that's normal. Now we have to apologize for having allergies. I'm with you there. So so you've been looking at the offshore arena the last few months. And what are some of the shifts in those scenarios that you've been that you've been looking at? Well, I started working in late February on an article that will appear in the May issue of J.P.T. And when I started making notes, the offshore industry was doing everything right and really starting to look up to 2019 had been the third best year on record for for the offshore. It dominated the highest volume of new discoveries since 2015. Free cash flow was approaching 90 billion dollars and break evens for pre FID deepwater projects were averaging 50 dollars a barrel. There also at that time was anticipated 60 billion dollars of Greenfield commitments with break evens of less than 40 dollars a barrel. So everything was really looking good. Then all of a sudden, in the period of a few days in March, the whole world changed. And with it, the offshore picture. So now basically, you know, it's moved to survival mode. Everything is down, obviously. Expectations from analysts are that seismic market will decline about 60 percent will probably end up with about 22 floating rigs. And the eight majors that make up three quarters of deepwater operations are cutting costs anywhere from 20 to 30 percent. Within that, all regions will be hard hit, probably Africa, the hardest for a number of reasons, partially because their break evens are 45 dollars and often 60 dollars to barrel. So is there is there a bright spot and the the offshore arena right now? Yeah, actually, there is. And in fact, some of the things that helped the offshore get into a good position for 2019 were helping them now. The a lot of the operators cut their costs as much as 50 percent. And so I think they're able to work much leaner. This, let's see, we're looking right here. Yeah. The other thing is cut off points for cut off points for for production becoming unprofitable. Show, as you can see in this chart, that offshore is not in such bad, bad shape for Saudi Arabia, conventional oil, the cut off point at which production becomes unprofitable is four dollars a barrel moves up to nine dollars for conventional onshore. Ten dollars for shell fork, also ten dollars for Russia, twelve dollars a barrel for global tight oil, thirteen for deep water and up to twenty eight for heavy oil. So not so bad. It really shows us that that OPEX is is not the issue. It's the exploration costs that are going to take the big hit here. Yeah, exactly. And that's what's being hit. That's being hit the hardest exploration drilling seismic, et cetera. But you're also seeing some silver linings, right? Yes. Yeah. For example, subsea tiebacks and phasing, which helped lower costs before are going to help now. Guyana, despite so many cutbacks ExxonMobil, which is cutting, I think, 30 percent is not touching their Guyana operations. And then in Norway, so Guyana is break even at thirty dollars. The Johans Ferdrup field in Norway is break even at less than twenty dollars. And one of the reasons for that is Equinor's adoption of digitalization, which brought them four hundred dollars, four hundred million dollars of extra cash flow last year. And they're expecting more. This picture is showing just came this morning talking about Equinor's digital twin operations. And these are two guys that what you don't see is the screen. This is how they're this is how they're operating the Johans Ferdrup with with a digital twin. So so digitalization, I think, is going to be a helper going forward and part of a silver lining. Well, thank you, Judy, for the offshore perspective. And the last thing we're going to talk to this morning is Steve Rasenfoss, our senior emerging technology editor. Steve, how are you doing? I'm doing OK. I'm doing OK at home. What I'm talking about this morning kind of goes back a ways back when I used to shake hands with people, though I was worried about it at the time. And when I got to go to the drilling conference is one of the last shows that happened before we all started working at home and good, good times, actually. So you wrote about innovation. You went in there not looking at big market trends, but you went in there looking for innovative ideas. What did you find? Well, what I found was three devices that solve problems. Actually, some problems I actually I didn't quite know were important on drilling rigs. One of the first ones was one that is involved with, you know, you think of drillers and they obviously it's important to drill well. They manage the crew well, but it turns out coding is a thing as well that every time they enter the record of what they're doing in the daily drillers, you know, they're going to be able to do it. And so what you're doing in the daily drill report, you've got to take take that thing and that each of these items and match it up with one of maybe more than like 100 codes. These codes vary from company to company or operator operation. So it's a tough thing for the drillers to get this right. And actually, they do a pretty good job. And so the data people who are trying to take these codes and use them to sort out what drillers really do and look for little slices of time to say, which as was pointed out by by Brian earlier is really getting to be critical that you get into situations where you're wanting to make sure that they're all right. And so the University of Texas rapid program, which is looking for new ways to push drilling automation, came up with an artificial intelligence way to sort through what they're doing and create an advisor for the coding. It's kind of like when you're doing a Google search. And so as it as you type words or as they type in the words of what they're doing, it quickly offers three suggested codes for it. And it turns out that when you know when they compare the accuracy of the what the machine offered and drillers would have chosen that the machines was right more than 90% of the time and drillers are like in the 80s, which considering there's all those codes, all those different codes, that's not bad. But the actual the accuracy should help the people doing searches later. It doesn't involve a whole lot of work and it probably isn't some something that drillers are going to resist because while they really care a lot about making decisions when say doing directional drilling, if coding is easier, that's fine. So I think it's an idea that has some potential there. Yeah, and it marries up with other things that we've seen as this digital takeover happens. You know, all the all the sort of back end wonkiness doesn't really translate translate well to the field. So, you know, user interface user experience. These things are paramount when trying to to get adoption out in the field. But what was your what was your second big, you know, innovation that you found or was it little? Well, we'll see. We'll see how it is. I mean, it is one of all these things have probably impacts that ultimately are hard to judge because what you're trying to do is to turn what they do, do what they do better in a way that you can get data that will maybe help you get a more realistic view of the world. And one way to do that is if you can look really well at the damage and measure really accurately the damage that it's that's really interesting because more and more there's people with automated drilling programs that in theory are reducing damage, reducing what happened, you know, inefficient drilling, but you don't really know what that what the reality check for that is. What is the drill bit look like when they pulled it up after it's gotten dulled in the ground or beat up broken? And that's another one of those things, rituals and the rigs most people never think about. This is done by the company representatives. They call them company men and commonly and those they're going to be asked whenever this thing is pulled might be the middle of the night might be dark might be it's usually is a time when they're very busy and try to do a very detailed look at all the many teeth on this. Look at breaks, where a lot of percentage questions I mean it's a really long question it could take hours and they don't have hours. And because there's, you know, those, when you're switching out drill bits a lot's going on in the rig that the company man wants to know about. So these guys have come up with it's called the bit box and instead of having a human do this, they'll the box covers this thing there's multiple cameras, they shoot a lot of pictures, creating what's can be like a 3D image graphically measured or digitally And that'll help them see what's going on. I mean the competition now is shooting it with a program that uses a cell phone and you know or mobile and there's anybody who takes their use those pictures of their phone. Quality lighting angles they're all very inconsistent so they're hoping they can create a device that's durable and about as cheap as a porta potty so that they think that people can afford them and put them on rigs in a regular way and the ultimate value will be what can you find out about drilling if you get this kind of data. We'll see how they and then OV do on this joint venture. Yeah, I, you know, I really like this innovation because it reminds me on the other side of how we've seen a lot of computer vision technology been brought in to take pictures of the drill cuttings on the shell shakers and decide sort of the stability of the borehole that way and this is sort of taking that idea back to the drill bit which is really interesting and yeah, you can imagine this is like a highly subjective human practice of trying to assess the wear and tear on a PDC. And customers are already interested looking at what else can they stick inside and to find out if it's a work or that. Okay, well and you also look at four meters is that right? Yeah, here's a problem that is pretty widely recognized mean what the flow in and out of wells is really important to make sure you control for month for one thing for well control because if there's an influx of gas that's going to change and early warnings and accurate warnings are really important. And nowadays, you know there's a lot of fairly inexact devices being used, the most popular being these paddle meter paddle not immediately meters but flow flow indicators and a panel is basically moves up and down. Based on how much fluids flowing through it, there's pretty enact it's a fairly subjective measure. These things get stuck when the dirt get all that drilling mud gets into the hinges. They're just, you know, they're fairly notorious but they're really hard to replace because this is a place where you want something that's small and you want something that's durable. Well, the best most accurate substitute has been the Coriolis meter. It's a good, you know scientifically sound concept but these things when you're running a lot of fluid with mud and cuttings in them tend to get have build ups on their walls, you start getting inaccurate results they're pretty large and they're hard to get fit on there and drill crews oftentimes just don't like the fact that these things are kind of finicky. And so they've just never caught on as a regular thing so an innovator at Norse which is a Norwegian Research Center. Is trying to create a device which is built on the same, you know, scientific concept. That's something that was tough and it was used in the sand business and here instead of having as you can see in this picture, which helps a lot the stuff comes in, flows in from the top and goes into that gold colored thing in the middle which is, if you looked at it, kind of like a water wheel and as the fluid and it's spinning and that because it's spinning the fluid and solids and all will be pushed out by centripetal force out to the walls of the device. While it's doing that, the force that they apply increases the torque on this spinning wheel by measuring precisely measuring that torque they can figure out what the you know what kind of fluid flow they have coming out when it hits the walls of that thing. And so they can tell kind of the sound of the meter they the sound of that they can tell kind of the mix. Are they getting more cuttings in? Is it getting heavier, you know, heavier lighter, it's going to float on the side so it doesn't tend to get gunked up and then flow out. That will give them further, you know, more detailed information. At this point, it looks like a promising idea. Some some pretty heavy duty people from the industry were asking him afterwards at the show. What's going to happen and they're going to do a joint joint industry project and hope to get it tested. Based on the conversation that started about it on LinkedIn, it sounds like there's a lot of interest, but like every other innovation, there's a lot of people that want to think about these things that are just it's too big, it's too complex, it's they got a better idea. So we'll see what we'll see what wins out over time. Yeah, well, anybody who's looked at flow meter technology or that space for any given time knows that it's, it's really an interesting world with with high hurdles, you're competing with technologies like you said they're either sort of notoriously inaccurate or cumbersome or delicate. And and even if you come up with a better match trap, it's it's really hard to displace those those legacy flow meters but but no thanks.

SPE Live: Maximizing Utilization of Subsea Well Intervention Equipment,"Hey, this is Trent Jacobs. I'm an editor with the Journal of Petroleum Technology here at the S B E. I'm joined by Steve Rassenfoss next to me. He is another editor at J P T. And today we're going to talk a little bit about perspectives from another part of the world. We sit here in Houston. But recently I went to the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Iran, Saudi Arabia and brought home some points that we wanted to talk about. So we wanted to kind of get into what the view of the U. S shale sector is from the world of OPEC. And talk about the energy transition that that it continues to sort of be a major theme in oil and gas today. That's Steve Rassenfoss here. And yet I was staying home while Trent was on his Saudi road trip, and I was looking at transition actually from the point of view of the future for workers be a future story. But in doing it, I realized when you're in Houston, you got a point of view actually wherever you are in the world. It's a global business, but there's a lot of different points of view. And there's a kind of a Houston bias. I guess at the moment, a lot of that's because shale is just so in our face. And right now it's contracting a lot of layoffs. It's not a happy time. It's sunny in Iran. Yeah. So in Iran, it was interesting because the you know, the the conference IPTC opened up with several VIPs from, you know, the Arab world from the OPEC world. And also had a smattering of some of the executive leadership from us shale, including Darren Woods from ExxonMobil and, and, you know, leaders from Halliburton and Baker Hughes. What was interesting is that when asked about, you know, sort of how Saudi and, and Bob Rain might view US shale, the response was was very patient. So I think that generally looking at US, the, the Arab world is seeing that growth is slowing down just like we are here. They also understand they've been saying this for years, that really access to cheap credit was was one of the driving factors of what led to the oil glut in 2015. Essentially, too many players being having access to capital. Well, that's all turned around. So they were very cautiously optimistic. So they're patient, I guess, because they're looking at in the race, they're looking at their opponents slowing. Well, they're, you know, they're looking at possibly a 1 million barrels a day of growth for the US in 2020. Sounds kind of optimistic. Well, that's the high side of the projections. You know, the US EIA thinks that and that's the number that was used by Saudi officials during plenary talks. But later, you know, somebody who's very near and dear to the shale world, Mark Papa, who is now the, the, the newly minted chairman of Schlumberger, but he's still the CEO of Centennial Development. And of course, he is the original sort of leader of E. O. G. When when black oil started being explored for shale and he and he threw out the number that he thinks only 400,000 barrels are going to be put into the growth factor for this year. So so I think the Saudis are sort of playing conservative with a million barrels growth. And that's going to dictate for them to maintain cuts on production. But you have Mark Papa coming out with a very low side estimation that would mean OPEC would actually have a greater role in global supply in the short term. And I guess you can argue with a lot of people about what the number is. But the trend line is I'm unmistakably down. That's what I've been saying. So, you know, if whether we're arguing about a million barrels or let's just say it's 900,000 barrels in growth a day or it's 500,000, that's kind of splitting hairs. I was having this conversation with people on Twitter too. And, you know, the signal is there that the growth is slowing. The big question is, does it not that it peaks this year or next year, but but has it peaked for good? So some people predict that there'll be a swamp and then fewer players will be here. We'll have some of the less healthy producers. You know, you'll have a bounce back. You know, that remains to be seen. You know, we know all the problems with subsurface physics and so with well spacing and fracture driven act interactions, frack hits. Those things are not covered by people that make these predictions. I think this is not those aren't built into the model. So from the Saudi point of view, because that's what's beautiful. I think about your trip is that you are and you can see this world from a really different kind of place. What are they doing to get rid of get ready for a few years? And what are the things that are going to be happening in the future where they get a larger role again in it? Well, I mean, you know, for a Ramco, obviously they you know, they're not just relying on guar anymore. We've been we've been writing about that. And they have other. Um fields that are getting ramping up and they have a lot of capacity. This you know, Saudi Arabia still has the largest technically recoverable reserves in the world. Um but on the flip side, you know, um, Ramco is clearly very, very inspired by the shell revolution. So I think there's a lot of. There's a lot of talk about the shell revolution. Um, and there's a lot of talk about the shell revolution from a tech angle, saying that this is, you know, represents a supply gut that was, you know, like we said, fueled by sort of access to cheap money. But on the technical side, and Ramco is very impressed for years for six years, they've had their own shell development program. They have three shell plays that they're targeting in the country. Two are near Guar. One is actually called the South Guar play, and then there's another to the north. Um and all three of them are in various stages of production. They're trying to get the technology up and down. They're watching and seeing what's learned with what's working here. And importing it into Saudi Arabia, and they're doing and they're trying to climb the technology. Uh ladder a lot faster than people in the U. S. One example is they've adopted rotary steerable systems for everything they drill. Which which we talked about with China is well, it took over a decade for that to become ubiquitous technology and the U. S. Shell revolution, but they've always been so focused on the digital side. They're really into it as well because they were in terms of things like seismic. They've been into mega, uh, data gathering for a long, long time. Ramco is big on in house digital initiatives. They do a lot of you know, they have plenty of partners. They have anybody who can be a partner of Ramco probably is, but they love to do in house stuff. Um and so they're applying a lot of that subsurface technology, digital technology to their technology. They have over 100 geologists working on it. So this this is, uh, uh, a development spread between three plays in Saudi Arabia, probably around 100 wells or less. And they have 100 geologists working on it. Well, geologists are obviously working with data. So yes, I you know, you've got to connect those dots and say there's a big digital impetus on. This unconventional program for Saudi Arabia and obviously for the conventional program. So one of the things that I noticed in the of the conference was that, uh, Ramco sees Shell is a very long term vision, you know, even though they're starting to say that we're kind of we're producing commercial gas. And by the way, they're producing gas, not oil with these unconventional wells. That they still might not be really ramping up or planning to ramp up for a decade. You know, one one guy actually told me he doesn't think it's really going to be material for 15 years. I do wonder how many years it's taken for them to drill under wells. Uh, and I think they're already working on it. And I think they're probably going to be. Right five or six and, uh, but they're testing, You know the horizons. They're very much in testing mode, so even though they got some commercial production going, I was also told by another consultant familiar with the Ramco. That a lot of wells are shut in because there's no pipelines. You know, some of these are very remote areas. Others are a lot closer to goire, so you can you can make a pipeline. But but some of these pipelines are still got to be, you know, miles and miles, dozens of miles long. Those are big capital projects, but a Ramco is now producing a lot of gas. And so I think that's a big reason why they said at the conference that we have given out of words for a couple of these projects. And as I said, you know, the big goal of the Ramco's shale ambitions is really to start producing a lot more gas. Everybody thinks about them as a crude producer. And the reason why they want to produce a lot of gas kind of leads into this next thing that we're going to talk about, but it's because they want to replace the oil that they burn to generate electricity. Partly because they want they rather export that, but also because the country is going through a very difficult time. So they're going to have to get the oil out of the country. They're going to have to get the oil out of the country. So they're going to have to get the oil out of the country. So they're going to have to get the oil out of the country. And gas will be cleaner as an electricity source for Saudi Ramco going forward. So I guess if they country with the most oil in the whole world. Is going to is looking at entering transition. We ought to take it serious. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And so that's that's the big topic that we're going to next, and we're going to take a quick break and be right back. Want to honor a colleague for their work. I think that's what I would say. You know, I think we're we're in the early innings. This it feels like day one of the energy transition, even though there's a lot of headlines, a lot of projects going on around the world. But, you know, when you hear Saudi or Ramco and Saudi, you know, the Minister of Oil in Saudi Arabia, start talking about the need to decarbonize the need to have more transparent discussions with the world's consumers, because essentially you have consumers battling the suppliers of the oil in terms of the cultural arguments that are being made. You know, it's it's so so the suppliers want to keep supplying and they know what that means to the world economy. And you have a Ramco. I mean, this is the world's, you know, world heavyweight of oil exports. So I think that when you listen to a Ramco talk about initiatives like the carbon circular economy, which is a sort of a new word for for most of us in the business, you got to you don't take it with a grain of salt like you may have a few years ago. This doesn't seem like greenwashing to me. Well, to me, it seems like when I look at any of these issues, it starts looking a lot more real when you see the economics behind it. And if they're looking at the stories we're going to based on projections like the one from BP that showed by 2030 or so, your band flattens out for a company like that. They have they are talking actively about what is the post oil economy look like? How do you diversify and create enough jobs for all the people there? And it does seem like a Ramco is going to be the cash for all that. Yeah, I mean, you know, Ramco is now officially the world's largest publicly traded company, you know, even though only a small share of the company is actually publicly traded. But so one of the things that they they talked about was that the energy transition is not a straight line and it's not a homogeneous mandate or plan. It's going to look different in different places. And so one of the two of the areas that Ramco is investing in and talking about a lot is helping to make engines, internal combustion engines more efficient. So this isn't something that most other oil companies are concerned with. Actually, you see some of the European majors investing in electric vehicles. Ramco saying, you know, we're going to open up an institute in Detroit and try to help make the engine cleaner. Another big thing that they talked up was trying to make air conditioners more efficient. So this actually ties back to why they want to make gas. The reason why they want to produce shale gas is to cut back on the nine hundred thousand barrels a day. They have to burn in the summer to power all the country's air conditioners. And, you know, as I got to see by visiting to Ron, there's a lot of ACs on the outside of six story buildings. So these are like window units, external small external units and not the 16 seer most efficient thing that you would see here in the States. So they're looking at the technologies that will help them there. And so so they've got, you know, Ramco is an integrated company. It's a national company. So they think a lot differently, I think, than even international major would as far as where their tentacles can go to address the carbon problem that everybody's talking about. I mean, they've always every time I go to a conference, I'm seeing the Saudi or Ramco hiring booth. They're always looking for people. Is they also hiring up to try to create the technical force to create this future? Yeah, I mean, they're probably they feel like they're expanding. I don't have, you know, exact growth numbers on their on their employment. But we were talking about the they they had representatives speaking to the fact that they are 70 percent millennial. Now we were talking about that. So so the way that this feeds into employment is that the companies that are talking about carbon programs, decarbonization programs, those are companies who are very likely concerned about recruiting the next generation of technical experts. It's basically one of the one the list of things I heard about what to take to be a long term survival is a mentality that understands that you're in a competitive world that is going through a change. And so make sure your skill set reflects that that change toward digital change toward less carbon. Well, digital experts digital experts are not necessarily oil and gas experts. And so when you're trying to get people from outside of this industry or who are being trained to go into many different verticals and you want to pull them into this industry, you have to acknowledge the giant climate debate that's happening. And as a competitive edge, a differentiator, you can say, well, my company's got half a billion dollars worth of green energy initiatives and investments going on. So if you're going to work in the oil and gas industry, you surely want to work with a company like mine who is doing the most about this issue. Yeah, because even if you have your skeptical thoughts, you have to look at it and think if the whole world is decided to go in a certain direction, you're kind of you kind of might as well go along with the big with the big change. Yeah. And I mean, and to that point, I'll say that it's not just a Ramco at this conference. You had the CEO of Total, you had the CEO of Exxon Mobil, Baker Hughes, Halliburton and several other companies. All of them were saying that, you know, to different degrees, we're going to reduce our carbon footprint. Some are some companies are clearly more vocal about this and putting a lot more money into it. But but to a T, there was there was a consensus, at least at this conference from the biggest companies in the world, that we we we hear what people are saying. We care and we're going to try to do something about it. Like I said, how they how they go about it is different ways. I don't think anybody's putting much more effort into it than companies like Shell or or Ramco. But but everybody is the arc is bending, if you will. So the world looks a little bit different there. Yeah, it does. I mean, you know, the to me, the Middle East is closer on this issue to where Europe is. And then North America is is following. And I think that as we hear Ramco and the European majors talk about this issue, they really sound similar in their messaging and some of their initiatives. I think that the European majors like BP and Shell are now the largest owners of electric vehicle cars, charging stations in Europe. And I think that that's something that you want to be it wouldn't be unheard of to see Ramco put a bunch of car charging stations all over Saudi Arabia. That's no insider information here. But that would not surprise me one bit. Then you will know that that they are closing in on where the Europeans are on this kind of messaging in action. But so far, your Uber driver did not have an electric. No, I didn't see any electric cars. Yeah, so I didn't mean and I always look for Tesla's because they're the easiest ones to find. I didn't see any car charging stations. I didn't see any solar panels. I didn't see any wind farms in Saudi Arabia. Sure saw a lot of growth, right? Yeah, yeah. No, it's you know, it's a vibe. It's a vibrant feeling in terms of the economy there. And Iran is, you know, the fourth biggest city in Saudi Arabia and not necessarily a tourist place. It's kind of like a lot like Houston, you know, where I feel like I felt like a sister city when I went there. And but but yeah, no, it's clearly vibrant. Every Uber driver I got into the car with it was under the age of 35 spoke English. Almost all of them had a college degree. Most of those college degrees were earned in the United States. They had very fond things to say about the United States and almost all of them wanted to work in oil and gas. And almost all of those guys wanted to work for Ramco. I mean, that was something I also ran into in this job story is that if you live in the United States, there's a lot of negative talk about the oil industry is going to be gone. That story begins with a question by a number of students saying, is there going to be a future in this thing? It sounds like it's different there. Totally, totally. I mean, at least for my weeklong sample size, it very much felt different. You did not feel like this was a dying industry being in Saudi Arabia. And and I think that's an important message for people to have because there's a lot of extreme positions being held. You know, but you look at we just put up on the JVD website this week, a story about the United States Energy Information Agency saying that crude oil in the United States and renewables are going to coexist. They're both going to grow or remain at historical highs and they're going to live together for the next 20, 30 years. So so the US is producing nine to 10 million barrels a day five years from now. And so is Saudi Arabia. Well, they're also going to be investing a lot in renewable technology or clean technologies or things that can take carbon out of the air. So so we're in this we're in this estuarial period of time where both things can live and not be mutually exclusive. Well, as one friend of mine once said from Detroit, the three fundamental freedoms are life, liberty and V8. So I guess it'll take a long time for us to completely drop that idea. Are you considering becoming an S.P.E. member? When you join S.P.E., you join a society of dedicated professionals just like you, working to address the technical challenges of the global oil and gas industry. S.P.E. membership gives you the opportunity to make local and global connections and build a network of influential technical leaders from every discipline. Learn more at S.P.E. dot org slash join. So, you know, staying on this topic just for a little bit more, one of the one of the interesting panels that that they had at IPTC was discussing sort of what are these alternative ideas? Right. We covered like sort of what Aramco is doing with the engines and air conditioners, but there was a whole like long list of other sort of out of the box ideas that the industry can help either finance or invest in and or adopt. And and people were talking about, you know, plants and that's become a big theme. So, you know, I think Shell's committed to planting a ton of trees. And one of the ideas was that this is actually being worked on in Saudi Arabia from an institute being funded in part by Aramco. They want to make energy plants and use genetic modification to make plants, you know, have longer root systems and maybe those root systems can turn carbon dioxide into polymers. It doesn't break down easily because, you know, plants can be turned into carbon pretty easily. And that's how we got charcoal in the first place. So there's lots of ideas like that. But I wanted to just finish with one other thought that was offered during one of the panels at IPTC came from Scott Tinker, who's the director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas. Please try to say that one fast three times. But he's he's spent several years studying energy poverty and issues around climate change. He's made a documentary. We've spoken to him before in the course of reporting. He's a really, really good speaker. I said on Twitter, you know, this guy is a deep thinker. He's very nuanced man. But he kind of tried to reframe this whole discussion around climate change and decarbonization and just kind of put a little bit of perspective on this, which is a lot of the clamor and debate, whether you're on both sides, whatever side you're on here. A lot of debates coming from the most developed countries in the world, the most industrialized countries in the world. And, you know, he just pointed out that, you know, that we have to have this discussion about the climate change. He noted that Vietnam is going to develop or build 50 more coal fired power plants in the next 15 to 20 years. And he's saying, you know, this is a narrow country. It's a thousand miles long with jungle. They do not have any solar power or wind power. They're not going to cut down the jungle to install that stuff. You know, these are the realities Tinker said. And and he said, you know, talking about places like Vietnam that were people who were in the middle of the world, you know, they were people who were in the middle of the world. That were people more people die because of inhaling a suit from, you know, the coal that they use in their kitchens or wood, as a matter of fact, charcoal. I mean, I mentioned this a couple of times in different podcasts, but I used to live in Haiti for two years where where I burned charcoal, you know, from the little trees that were left in that country. And yes, it makes a lot of smoke. But that was that was the fuel that you bought on the street to to cook with. Do you think we treat it as an inevitability or do you think we could sell them some LNG anyway? Well, I mean, yeah, maybe. I mean, LNG, he's saying that, you know, LNG might make more sense than telling Vietnam to slow down its economic growth so that it can put up invest in wind power, which might be more expensive. So, you know, I look at energy like this. And if you're going to ask Sub-Saharan Africa to put their economies on hold after the United States and Europe had 100 years of unbridled economic growth and burning lots of carbon to do it or generating lots of carbon to do it, you're going to ask the rest of the world to try and stop growing. And the argument that Scott's basically making is a that's not really practical. And so we need to have his whole message. And I totally agree with him on this. His whole message was the world, the industry and the world need to have an honest conversation about these issues and and engineers listening to this. You really have a sensible voice in that space. And, you know, to borrow on, you know, something I said earlier, these things are not mutually exclusive. You can be an energy producer and you can take climate change very, very, very seriously. And I think anybody who works in the industry also knows that the engineers keep coming up with things that lead to a world, an industry that evolves in very unpredictable ways. So when you debate these things, understand that the economics and the innovations might take us to a place none of us expect. Yeah. And, you know, I think we all just need to listen to each other more and maybe understand, like, to your point, this debate will evolve in five years. I've seen it evolve since I joined the industry in 2010. This and I don't know about what your perspective on this is, but I mean, climate change was was more or less here a taboo subject 10 years ago, whereas now it's headlining major SBE conferences. It's the it was the if you walked out of the first day of IPTC in Saudi Arabia, you went home thinking about, wow, the energy transition is a huge topic. Just recently, I heard about some people in Asia talk having beginning to talk about whether the LNG they're buying from the United States involves a lot of methane leakage. It's change. It's going to change the business in a lot of subtle, fundamental ways. Well, and we just put up a story about, you know, startups raising money and a couple of the companies that raise big money and one got acquired were methane detection companies, you know, methane leakage, mitigation technologies. So, yeah, you know, keep an eye on all this stuff. We could do a whole episode on methane mitigation and emissions. We probably probably probably such a big topic. It deserves having an expert come in. But you're all petroleum engineers. So you'd probably rather us talking about how you get more of that stuff out of the ground so you can or keep it in the pipeline, you know, so make more money. But but anyways, yeah, that's all I had. You know, I BTC is going to be in Kuala Lumpur next year. But then in 2022, it's going to come back to Saudi Arabia. It sounds like Saudi Arabia and Ramco really were happy with the turnout over. I believe the high estimate I saw was eighteen thousand attendees, which which was, you know, broke broke the records and spades. A lot of interest. And it's good to see a multidisciplinary event happen in that part of the world. So I was very honored to go. And with that, you know, that was all I had to offer. So I think we'll let everybody go. That's it. Keep keep looking for it. OK, be sure to check in with us online at JPT and follow SBE online at on our Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. I'm Trent. Thank you very much.

SPE Live Podcast: Rising to the Challenge of the Constantly Changing World of Work - A Conversation with Brian Kraus,"You're listening to the SPE podcast. I'm Paige McCowan and we're talking about the SPE International Robotics Competition with... Fred Florence. And Enrique Lozoya. Welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to welcome my guest today, Fred Florence. Fred is president of his own consulting company, RIG Operations, and he's a founding member of the SPE Drilling System Automation Technical Section. And Enrique Lozoya, who is a doctoral student in petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University and led a team of students to first place in the 2017 SPE DSAT Drillbotics Competition. So welcome, Fred and Enrique. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for the invitation. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Great. So as I said, we're going to discuss drilling automation and the SPE International Drillbotics Competition. But before we dive into the competition, I wanted to talk a little bit about drilling automation. Fred, you're a founding member of the DSATs and have been in the industry for more than 45 years. So can you talk a little bit about why drilling automation is so important and maybe how it's changed the discipline? A number of us were involved in working with the control system, control systems on a bunch of drilling rigs as things were changing mostly about 20 years ago. And we built supervisory control systems that allowed the driller to sit in a chair and control multiple machines, in some cases simultaneously. And we realized that this form of mechanization could be used in a form of automation. So the drilling machines were robots. But what we wanted to do is make the robot smarter to help the driller do his job better. And in some ways, it was to avoid problems. I think the biggest issue was how can we avoid making mistakes that are costly or dangerous? And how can we improve the efficiency in some fashion? So that's where it started. Several people got together at a technical conference and decided to form a group that became the technical section, Drilling Systems Automation. And that was really formed so that we could facilitate the introduction of automation so that we could communicate to people who were not familiar with it what it could do and what values it could bring to the industry. And it was slow to grow, but there's over a thousand members there today. And there's other technical sections that are using some of that automation for data and modeling for everything from managed pressure drilling to automated directional drilling. And I think these changes are more important today because of the reduction in the price of oil. There's a huge drive today to be more efficient. There's any cost margins are really cut very, very narrowly now because of the low price. And so anything that the industry can do to avoid costly mistakes is really important. And I think it's probably more so now than it was when we started. Yeah, you're right, especially in today's environment. It's very important. So hopefully the work that you've been doing over the years will help us get through what we've got ahead of us in the industry. So that's great. So let's talk about the competition. What is Drillbotics and how does that competition work? How was it developed? In short, Drillbotics is a competition for college students to design and build an automated drilling rig. It's on a laboratory scale, about five or six feet tall, seven feet tall. And the idea was for them to understand what automation is and the problems of getting there. It started, of course, with DSAATs. And later at a forum in Paris, I was talking with somebody who had a miniature rig in Austria, Gerhard Teinhauser at Montaigne University in Laobant, built a mini rig to teach his students about drilling. And when I saw that, I said, what if we made a competition and walked around the room? A lot of people said it's a good idea. So we came up with this really strange name called the International Student Competition. And then John McPherson said, Fred, go find a better name. So I went to Google and I started Google potential names. I came up with something called Drillbotics and I walked around my office and said to everybody, what is Drillbotics? And I said, I don't know. And I said, well, what do you think it means? Well, drilling with a robot or robotic drilling or something like that. So I went out and trademarked the name and that's how we got it. That's great. You definitely need a more diverse name or a more specific name than international competition. Well, our main purpose was to get students that were newly minted coming right out of the university that then became drilling engineers where they were not afraid of drilling automation. A lot of old folks didn't understand it. They're scared of computerized technology in the industry, which is difficult at the field level. And at the time that we started, we didn't have the technical knowledge and the types of hardware available that we have today. So it's a lot easier to do, still difficult, but a lot easier to do and safer to do than it was originally. And if we can get students to understand and not be afraid of it, then they're probably going to be willing to deploy it. And then the second half of that was we want them to do research and come up with things that we can't come up with. So we try to challenge them not just to build a machine, but to learn from it. And we actually score the winning team on how much they learn, not on what they do. It's not how fast you drill. It's not where you drill. It's what did you come up with? It's novel. It really shows that you've learned something that the other people haven't seen. Right. And it's kind of passing the torch to the next generation to kind of, like you said, take the automation and come up with something different and not be afraid to push it forward. Absolutely. And these are really smart young women, young men and women from all over the world. They come from every country imaginable. The university might be in Oklahoma, but they have people from four different teams, four different countries that are on that team. And so the other thing that they had to come up with was an interdisciplinary team. So what we saw before was we have all these silos in the industry. We have electrical people that don't know anything about drilling. We have drilling people that don't know anything about control systems. We have people that know controls and drilling, but they might not understand how to do it in real time. And real time may be in the sub-second type of range. And so there's a lot of things that have to happen in our industry that are interdisciplinary. So we thought, let's go brainwash these guys right now so that when they come out of school, they'll fit right in and actually become leaders. Yeah, they learn to work on a team together. So Enrique, that was kind of one of the things that drew you to this competition was the interdisciplinary part of it because you were passionate about that. Is that one of the things that got you involved? Oh, that's correct. That's absolutely right. Yes. So honestly, three years ago, I was starting my master's degree and I was struggling to find a project where I could bring my bachelor's experience because I had a bachelor's in mechatronics engineering. It's kind of robotics and automation. And then apply that knowledge to these newly learned knowledge during the master's degree. And that's where I found out about robotics. And I was instantly drawn into this project because it was the perfect fit. It was a blessing to me back then. I was like, here I could have my passions, my skills, and then bring this real live automation challenge and drilling engineering into a fun, fastly paced, and collaborative competition. So it was really, really, really nice to have found this competition. So like we said, you were on the winning team from 2017. Can you tell us about your project and the challenge that you had to solve? Yes. So the competition is, as Fred mentioned before, it's basically come up with a completely autonomous and automated lab scale rig. And it only has to have two, kind of just the start and stop. And honestly, just the emergency start and stop. Everything else has to be automated from start to end of the drilling process. And not only that, but you also need to optimize drilling. And okay, yes, optimizing ROP is one point, but you also need to worry about note breaking the drill string or drill pipe that you have in there. And then you also need to worry about how can you, a couple instrumentation, drill time control systems, downhole sensors, wireless transmission systems, and a little bit of machine learning and dysfunction identification in real time. So that was quite a challenge. And we had to basically engineer and direct all the design on the electrical system, on the control systems, on the algorithms, and on the machine learning identification as well. And then bring them all together into, well, just basically for the judgment day right now at the end of the competition. Well, I'm sure it was stiff competition too, because there's a lot of schools involved. And I mean, do you know, Fred, do you remember how many teams you would have in maybe one year, maybe the last year, how many teams? Well, we started with four and last year there were 16. Oh, there you go. Yeah. So Enrique, back to your story. So what did you learn from this competition and how do you think it has prepared you to enter the industry? Back then, I was still very inexperienced and very afraid to go into the industry. Don't take me wrong, I'm still very inexperienced to be honest. But it really provided me a massive window into other disciplines within the petroleum engineering as Fred was talking about. This silos, right? And on petroleum engineering, we're not usually taught carefully in the curriculum, like real time drilling optimization, control theory, machine learning before it was thrown out everywhere. And programming skills. So I had to improve my prior knowledge and learn new stuff, but at a deeper level to fix the issues that we were facing. Then I'm pretty sure those skills will be, they prepare me for more challenging technical engineering projects on the road. Now, having said that, I feel like the most important skills acquired through drillbotics for both my career-wise and personal growth were collaboration and team management. Without either of them, honestly, our team wouldn't have succeeded in much less, and much less one year. It really taught me to be much more collaborative. As a grad student, we are just focused on our project and it's a very individual kind of task. Focus on your research, get the papers out, write the thesis, and everything is individualized. Your success depends on you and you only. Kind of. Not all the time, of course, but most of your success, though. But then you go into real life and you realize you need a team to be successful. And the amount of stuff that you will be able to achieve individually are nothing compared to what you'll be able to achieve with a good team. So I believe that identifying those passions and skill sets linked to different types of personalities and in such a multidisciplinary team, because we had an electrical engineer team, we had a mechanical engineer team, we had a drill engineer, production, etc., as students, all students from different departments. And then we were learning from each other, right? The electrical engineer was teaching us how the circuit worked and we were teaching the electrical engineer what drilling was and etc. So that realization that keeping the team focused on the essential details of the project while respecting and encouraging their self-discipline and board boundaries led to huge strides in everyone's progress. And to me, that was and still is the best lesson for robotics students and future professionals. Yeah, that's great. I mean, hands-on learning, especially too. I'm a big proponent of that and I think it really helps students move into the industry no matter what industry it is with some practical application. But let me ask you this. You said you were afraid to go into the industry. What's behind that? Because that's a concern actually that a lot of students have right now because of the cyclical nature of the industry. But what was your hesitation in the beginning? Since I didn't have a bachelor's, so I didn't have any prior knowledge in petroleum engineering per se, everything was new to me and I was completely unprepared for what was out there. And not only that, but I went straight out from my bachelor's into a graduate degree. So I didn't feel ready to be faced with real life challenges or to be competing at this level and to be adding value to the petroleum engineering realm. But this definitely helped prepare you. Absolutely, yes. It did. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

So, Fred, tell us a little bit about how the competition has evolved over the years. We started off with a competition that was very limited. We had a single block of sandstone cut in half with a sliver of marble stuck in the middle. And we told people, go build the rig, sit it on top of this thing and dig a hole through it. Oh, yeah. And we gave them a piece of spaghetti pipe. So if they tried to muscle their way through it, the pipe would break. We provided the bit for them to use. And they all came up with different concepts of how to do it, and all of them failed. Everyone had the pipe vibrate into or buckle or some other type of failure. Everyone failed. And that was great because you learn from failure. And the next year, only one team failed. And so we changed the pipe a little bit to give them a fighting chance. But we still knew that they would have to understand the physics of what they were doing. And we wouldn't tell them. We'd give them a couple of references, but they had to figure most of it out on their own. I might back up a little bit and say the way that the competition is structured is in the fall term, the teams produce a design report. There is no physical rig. It's just a design. And they have to send that by New Year's Eve. And in January, the judging committee reviews those and selects finalists. And finalists then build the rig in the spring. And then at the end of the spring term in May or June, judges would go to the schools and witness down the drill. And then the judges would get together afterwards and pick the winning teams. And the prize was always a chance to get a paper published at an SPE conference. It evolved into the program committee of the SPE IADC drilling conference, giving us a permanent slot for a paper. And then we also flew the team and their supervisor to the conference, wherever that was, and paid their way there. So they come out of school with a publication on their resume. And a lot of experience. So that was the prize. Well, anyway, we kept making it harder and harder. Of course, they all figured out what to do, so we had to make it harder. So I started making the rock in my garage. And I used different types of materials at various angles. And in the drilling world, we call it formation dip. And we had a huge formation dip of 45 degrees or more. And they had to be able to drill through this hands-free. And they had to recognize you're going from hard to soft or soft to something else. And what should be the optimal drilling parameter as you go through this new rock? Well, they had to find out ways to do that autonomously. And so one of the things that the team from A&M did is they looked at vibration signatures as they were drilling different types of rock. And they decided, based on what we see, based on what we can measure, we believe we're in one type of formation. And when they saw different vibrations, they said, oh, we're now in a different formation. And so what they were able to do was to change the parameters quickly during the transition. When half of the bit is on one type of rock and the other side of the bit is on a different strength rock. And they were able to do that in real time. And it was really amazing. And that's the kind of things that in the industry, when we are drilling with an autodriller, it may take too long for the autodriller to recognize we're in a different formation. And so some of the things that they came up with, in my opinion, are patentable. So it's really a research project. It's not a science project. So we kept giving them harder formations. I guess the hardest was the one, the time that I put a piece of rubber mat in the bottom of it. When they drilled into the rubber, it just kind of got everything to stick, like drilling tar in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the folks were pretty surprised and almost upset with me. But they also were able to drill it. So that was good. And then we started into a harder challenge, and that was hands-free directional drilling. So the first year was go down a certain depth, kick off, and see how much angle you can build in this direction. And they didn't have a specific target. It was just make it as built as fast as you can. And then eventually, of course, we gave them a target. And then last year, we had it all set up to have two targets. So they had to drill down through a point. They had to drill down, make a turn, go through a point, make turns to go through a different point. So true directional drilling. All of this was with a six-foot-tall drilling rig. Oh, meanwhile, you've got to make sure that you don't burn the bit. You've got to have the right kind of lubrication. You've got to make sure you don't damage the pipe. Oh, the electronics. By the way, electronics are getting cooled by water. Electronics don't like water. So they had to learn how to make and seal downhole sensors and things like that. Again, it's a research project, not a science project. Yeah. So, I mean, it's tremendous what they have accomplished. They are young men and women, but because I'm an old guy, sometimes I refer to them as the kids. And when I hear people my age in the industry tell me what we can't do, I say, don't worry, we'll give it to the kids and they'll show you how. Yep, absolutely. So you mentioned patents. Have there been any patents that have come out of any of these projects that you know of? Ricky, what's the update? Right here. Oh, yes, yes, actually. We submitted a patent application in 2019 last year and it's still pending. But hopefully we'll get it granted. Yeah, it's related to this formation identification process. That's amazing. That's amazing. I mean, yeah, that is a big prize, right? Coming out of school with papers and patents and, you know, that really puts you ahead of the competition out there. There's a team from Germany, the University of Klausthal. They are in an area where there's a lot of geothermal drilling, a lot of hard rock. And they came up with a different type of bit. It's a percussion type bit, a hammer drill, if you will. And they are been working with the company now. I don't know if it would be their patent, but I think that that company may actually build their design. There's a team from Norway that came up with a bit that it looks like there's a Norwegian company that is going to manufacture the bit according to their design. So it's, you know, you got electrical and mechanical engineers designing bits. I mean, there's all kinds of crazy things that happen on these teams. Yeah, no, but it's good though, because that's, you know, that's what you have to do when you get out in the real world, right? Work with teams. And, you know, we talk a lot about, I work with the energy education program at SPE, and I get a lot of questions about, you know, what is the industry looking for in a student or in a graduate? And everybody that I've talked to or anybody that I've interviewed said, you've got to solve problems. You know, you've got to be able to take the information and come up with an answer to it. So this is a great learning experience, I think. Well, I remember in one of the first years, in the middle of the competition, we changed the size of something, and they all complained. And I said, well, we build iron roughnecks and pipe handlers for a certain size drill pipe. And then all of a sudden, people that manufacture drill pipe come up with one that's a different size. We have to deal with it. So here's their instructions. Deal with it. And they did. And they did. No, this is great. I love it.

So, you know, with what's happened over the past, oh my gosh, it's only been like five months. Fred, what is the impact of COVID-19 on the competition? Well, it was devastating for us in 2020. So the 2019-2020 season was devastating because the students were not allowed to meet. They couldn't meet in person in school. They couldn't go into a lab. Because of the need for social distancing. And so it was just impossible for them to do that. In addition, most of their classes were canceled and they began to use remote school, some remote classes of some form. And so that was traumatic for them. Just that one change. We looked at how we might be able to do the test remotely, but we recognized how much pressure we were putting on the students over and above what they already had. And so we decided to pull the plug. So we did cancel the 2020 competition. That's too bad. So what's the plan for moving forward? As we go forward, we've had some preliminary meetings to write the guidelines for the 2020-2021 competition. We initially assumed that none of the schools could meet. And so we talked about having a virtual competition only. But we've had some schools from, predominantly from Europe and one from the United States that says they can meet. And they would like to have a fiscal rig competition as well. For the 2019-2020 competition, we recognized that some schools could not afford the $10,000 charge and cost that it often took to build one of these miniature rigs. And so we decided to give them a chance. Let's let them build a virtual rig. And so people did the research, had to understand how these different drilling machines worked, and had to model each of those machines, and then model the control system to control them, to model some kind of downhole formation, and where the bottom hole assembly could react to that formation. And then they had to be able to drill a directional well. It's all done virtually. And unfortunately, we had to pull the plug on the 2020 competition because of the virus. And so we didn't see the end results. But some of them made some really good progress. As we move to 2020-2021 competition, I'm just going to call it the 2021 competition, will probably go with a virtual design. It may be a tentacle, a couple of fine-tuned points on the guidelines from last year. So it may be that they do the exact same thing and build a virtual rig. And we'll meet in the next, the committee will meet in the next two to three weeks to try to determine what that will be. We do have some schools from Europe, one from the United States, that can meet in person at the lab. And they would like to continue with the mechanical rig. And we'll see if we can accommodate that, how they can have that done, where the testing is done, either remotely or virtually, or something that could be done next spring. So there's a couple of things for us to work out. So can teams still sign up for it, or has the deadline passed for signing up for the 2021 competition? We haven't even put the registration on the website yet. Our goal each year is generally to have the guidelines finished in July to August, where they can have the guidelines the first week of September, when most of them return to school. And we give them a couple of months to register. Oh, that's good. And so people who are interested can go to drillbotics.com to see that information and sign up if they want to, if they haven't already. There's not a form to sign for this year's competition. There will be shortly. The blog that's there will tell you the latest news. Well, this is so exciting. I love, like I said, I love the hands-on learning and the practical experience. Enrique, is there anything you can give any kind of advice for teams that are signing up for the competition coming up or that are interested in it? If they decided to sign up, they should start getting their team members now and just go on the website and sign up for it. They're not going to regret it. That's great. Well, Enrique Frad, I really appreciate you being with us today and telling us about this competition. I think it's very timely and it will help a lot of students out there who are looking for something to get some hands-on experience. I'd like to say one thing is a lot of people have heard of the program and they look at our committee and what we might be doing. What I really want to do is recognize the large number of people who've made this happen. It's not just four or five people on a program committee. It's really dozens and dozens of people along the way. It's people who have given their time to be on one of the design committees of the program, writing the guidelines, others who were judges that have flown around the world to judge the competition. Some of the people who have recruited new schools and just because they thought the program was nice and their alums that said, I believe my school has a good competition, they had a chance to compete here. We want to give them a chance and they've recruited some really good teams. People who have worked within DSATs to keep the program funded. Now, SPE is funding the program to a large extent. The number of people and the number of hours that go on in the background to make all these things that seem invisible to everyone else. It is a tremendous effort by SPE and DSATs and other technical sections, DUPTS and Wellborn Certainty. Without all these individuals, this program wouldn't be what it is. I really want to thank everyone. Yep, that's a good point. Thank you, Fred. I appreciate it. So again, thank you, Fred and Rike for being with us today. We hope to spread the good news about drillbotics and how it can help drilling students. Thank you, Paige. Thank you for inviting us. Thank you. Let's keep the conversation going.

SPE Live Podcast: The Energy Transition ‚Äì Envisioning a Lower Carbon Future,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the SPE Live Technical Director Series, CCS and CCUS Opportunities and Challenges for Safe Storage and Decarbonization Efforts. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on August 26th, 2024. Welcome to this SPE Live on Carbon Capture Storage, CCS, Carbon Capture Storage, Utilization and Storage, CCUS, Opportunities and Challenges for Safe Storage and Decarbonization Efforts. My name is Simeon Eburi. I am a Reservoir Management Advisor in Chevron's Technical Center and SPE North America Regional Director. I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest, Sue Staley, is the SPE Technical Director for Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability. She's the Sustainability Director for VPSI Group LLC, where she leads the company's sustainability practice. Prior to joining VPSI, she was the General Manager of Soil Groundwater Technology at Shell. And she held various positions within Shell during her 18-year tenure. Prior to Shell, she worked as a consultant at ERM. She has been an Environmental and Safety Engineer for 30 years. She holds a Master's Degree in Engineering, Environmental Emphasis from Purdue University and a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. Rodolfo Gabriel Camacho Velazquez is a professor in the Petroleum Engineering Department at the National University of Mexico, where he teaches courses related to natural fracture reservoirs and provides guidance and monitors research progress on the subject. Rodolfo worked for PEMEX for 25 years, where he was the manager of different positions and identifying assets, technical needs and providing guidance on the dynamic characterization and behavior of complex naturally fractured reservoirs. He holds a Master's and Doctorate's Degrees in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Tulsa and a Bachelor's Degree in Geophysical Engineering from the National University of Mexico. In addition, he is also the current SBE Reservoir Technical Director. Sue and Rodolfo, welcome to this SBE Live. Thank you, Simon. Thank you, Simon. Thank you, Simon. So the subject of CCUS is a very interesting one in our industry. So I'm going to start with Sue. Sue, where does the carbon capture, utilization and storage CCUS fit in the net zero emissions aspirations? Thank you, Simian. Hello, Simian and Rodolfo. It's very nice to see you both. Hello. Before Rodolfo jumps off into some highly technical aspects around CCUS, I thought we could talk about how CCUS fits in this broad context of net zero emission aspirations. And just as a reminder, net zero emissions is the overall balance between greenhouse gas emissions produced and greenhouse gas emissions taken out of the atmosphere. And hopefully our audience is well aware that the world is on a path toward net zero emissions and CCUS plays a role in that. But what is that role of CCUS? And according to the IEA, reaching net zero will be virtually impossible without CCUS. And so that's one reason that we're seeing many governments around the world looking to see how can they put in policies that will allow more and faster CCUS developments. It's quite clear that this is very important for the net zero emissions. And there are several ways that CCUS will contribute towards decarbonization efforts. The first is that there are many industries that we have today that produce quite significant CO2 emissions that are very hard to abate, meaning they're hard to conduct that operation without generating CO2. And so energy. We know that our industry generates quite a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. Chemicals industry as well. Cement has a significant contribution with very difficult emissions to abate as well as steel production. All these industries are necessary for our society. And so CCUS is a partner technology that will help us to be able to do that. And so we know that these industries are necessary for our society. And so CCUS is a partner technology that will help these industries to abate some of their CO2 emissions and through capturing and sequestration. And as solar and wind power become a greater share of the energy supply, we know that they don't produce when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing. And so there are backup power needs associated with these types of energies. And so CCUS could help supply low carbon electricity. Third, hydrogen also is becoming an important part of a net zero world. And so CCUS helps solve the carbon dioxide emissions from hydrogen that is derived from natural gas. And then the final example I have is around just cleaning the air. So CCUS can be used to store carbon removed from the air that can't be abated or avoided. And so I hope that I've shown that there is a compelling case for increasing the number of CCUS projects globally. And we'll talk a little bit later about some of the barriers that we're seeing around and challenges that governments are facing around CCUS projects. Thank you, Sue, for that overview. And I think that was a great background in terms of all the different connections to CCUS in our industry and, of course, into our net zero emissions aspirations. I'm going to take now the conversation to Rodolfo. Rodolfo, Sue mentioned carbon dioxide. And so carbon dioxide can be injected into depleted reservoirs to increase their pressure and provide the driving force to extract residual hydrocarbons, while part of the injected CO2 remains stores there. How do you see the technologies and challenges for the injection of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery, EOR? Well, the use of CO2 for EOR is a proven technology. Most of the CO2 is used to reduce the forces trapping oil in the porous media, mainly reducing interfacial tension and viscosity and causing oil swelling. Most technologies of CCUS are mature. And there are studies on several aspects of EOR, such as geochemical modeling and the leakage and risk estimation. Injectivity tests are useful to confirm the seal, the reservoir injectivity, surface injection pressure, and the best completion strategy. Generating the injection conditions close to CCUS is critical, especially in heterogeneous reservoirs, where petrophysical correlations for modeling require calibration with dynamic data. Injectivity tests are challenged by the limited volume of CO2 tanks, its corrosive nature, and the very low temperature. The test duration should be optimized to get a good pressure transient response for the available volume of CO2. Liquid is mostly injected at a stable rate to reduce the risk of near-wellboard damage caused by fluid inconsistency or exceeding the tracture gradient. It is critical to calculate and optimize the required CO2 volume and injection rate to optimize the well and reservoir performance and minimize cost. The best situation is if we inject CO2 under miserable conditions and combine with alternatives with water. Doses are necessary to consider the minimum miscibility pressure as a key design parameter for CCUS. Recently, it has been mentioned in the literature that dimethyl ether is an efficient agent in assisting CCUS while enhancing CO2 sequestration. This substance impedes the escape of lighter hydrocarbons from good oil due to the CO2 extraction effect, which is critical for sustainable oil recovery. Depleted reservoirs are ideal sites for CCUS since the necessary infrastructure, including ground facilities, injection wells, transporting pipelines, and well-known geological characteristics already exist. The potential of large amounts of CO2 stored is limited in this process. In the Weyburn project that started in 2000, the reservoir is estimated to store more than 30 million tons of industrial CO2. I stop there. Thank you, Simon, for the question. Thank you, Rodolfo. I think that was a deep dive into the carbon dioxide injection issues or opportunities and respect to the HANSOL recovery. So I'm going to take a moment to remind our audience that they can ask questions in the chat during the program. Please, you have two experts, Rodolfo and Sue, so be sure to type your questions on the chat so that we can ask them those questions towards the end of the program. Now, going from technical depth of challenges and opportunities for you, let's just go back to Sue. Sue, there are more than technical challenges. I know Rodolfo talks about the subsurface specific challenges with CCUS. But can you share some of the non-technical challenges that you see for CCUS? Yes, and I think that many of the non-technical challenges are also non-technical challenges that we see with the traditional energy, oil and gas operations. You know, CCUS is not a new technology. It has been around for decades. However, it has not been around globally. And so there are many places where CCUS could be deployed, but there are government policies that are either emerging, they're non-existent or they're emerging, or they're just not in a position where companies can take advantage of being able to develop these types of projects. These projects are large and complex, and you can hear from Rodolfo, there are many technical challenges to be overcome. And when projects are quite complex and highly technological, sometimes those projects are not readily accessible or readily received by the public, the local community, in terms of being able to understand the risks to that community. And so sometimes communities will not want to put a project in their backyard. You know, you hear that saying quite a bit, not in my backyard. And so I think that there will need to be work done to help communicate with communities around the safety and the environmental aspects of CCUS projects to help communities accept them. And there are also regulatory permitting issues. The United States is promoting more and more CCUS projects by the Department of Energy, but then we have the EPA who is regulating those, and the permitting is quite slow. And so you have one part of the government who wants to move quite quickly and another part of the government who's saying, wait a minute, we need to permit this, we need to better understand it. So you see those types of issues as well. And with traditional oil and gas, permitting is one of the areas that can delay a project and project delays are quite costly. So I think that we will see a lot of effort around how can we streamline permitting? How can we give the regulators the information that they need to feel comfortable that these projects are safe, they're good for the environment, they're good for communities. And so, you know, the traditional challenges that we have with oil and gas, we will see also with CCUS. Thank you, Sue, for that summary of all the non-technical challenges. We call them above ground challenges. And you have, of course, turned to understand the technology that Rodolfo described and also try to work with partnerships and regulatory agencies to make it all work. So it's definitely not an easy challenge, but one that our industry can solve. So I'm going to go back to Rodolfo for some additional questions on the CCUS and CO2 storage side. So deep saline aquifers are considered to have enormous potential for storage of CO2. Can you comment, Rodolfo, on the pros and cons of the CCUS option from a technical standpoint? Yes, Simeon. Despite the high storage potential that saline aquifers have, there is less knowledge about the storage properties of saline aquifers as compared to other sizes, bathed, cold, red, and oil and gas reservoirs. Some characteristics of CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers at 700 to 1000 meters depth are CO2 phase behavior, CO2 water-rock interaction, and CO2 trapping processes that include buoyancy, residual gas trapping, solubility, and mineral trapping. With the experience gained in projects like the Slitner project that started in 1996, CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers is technically feasible. Global storage of saline aquifers could be far more than a trillion tons of CO2, however adequate injectivities are prerequisite for underground storage. Only information that have both volumetric capacity and reasonable injectivity can be considered for storage. The main parameters that affect CO2 injectivity in saline aquifer are permeability and thickness. Another factor such as relative permeability, reservoir size, and heterogeneity also control injectivity. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the injection pressure must not exceed 90% of the fracture pressure of the formation. CO2 can be trapped in saline aquifers by dissolution in the water, and vaporization of water occurs along with the dissolution of CO2. And this can cause salt precipitation, which reduces porosity and permeability in the near-well board region, and can lead to reduction in injectivity. Also, the pore pressure variation resulting from CO2 storage may compromise the formation, the cap rock, and the force integrity. The major risk associated with sequestration in saline aquifers is the potential leakage through the cap rock and overburden. This leakage is dependent not only on the formation type, the cap rock integrity, trapping process, and external loads acting on the formation, but also on the amount and rate of CO2 sequestration and the resulting geomechanical effects. Thank you, Rodolfo, for that explanation on the deep saline aquifer. So I'm going to stay with you for a minute here, because one thing is to store and to inject the CO2. Another thing is to ensure that it stays contained and to monitor. So potential leakage of the storage CO2 eventually could lead to serious consequences on the surrounding environment. Could you comment on some monitoring techniques aimed to assure the site integrity and the absence of leakages and to verify long-term containment? If you can give us a quick recap on this part of the equation, that would be great. Thank you, Rodolfo. Yes, Emil. The main future for underground storage is that CO2 will be retained for long periods of the order of magnitude of 1,000 years without any leakage to the surface. Buoyancy is a key process for CO2 storage and injection at early stages of disposal. And CO2 is injected at the base of the reservoir, and the CO2 plume migrates laterally with the most permeable beds, through the most, within the most permeable beds, until it finds either a conductive fall or fracture to move upward and accumulates below the base of the cap rock. CO2 plume behavior is a function of the horizontal and vertical heterogeneities within the formation. Of course, the formation cap rock and fall integrity is a function of the local stress conditions. And remote monitoring is essential for observing plume migration and potential leak detection during and after the injection. Seismic monitoring can be used during the pre-injection phase to identify the characteristics of the storage site and structural integrity. During the injection and post-injection seismic is applied to the monitoring of the plume evolution. We can also use electrical methods when CO2 is displacing fluids with higher conductivity, like brines, giving information about CO2 saturation and the spatial distribution of the plume. Combinations of repeated seismic and electromagnetic surveys are useful to delineate the plume and estimate the gas saturation in the aquifer. A range of thermal processes are involved in CO2 injection, causing temperature changes around the face, around the plume, the CO2 plume, and changes in underground density due to the injection can be detected by a small perturbation in the gravitational field. A loss in density is observed when CO2 displaces denser brine. Monitoring these changes gives information on the CO2 diffusion rate. Also, injection of large volume of fluids can cause a certain degree of overpressure, leading to the formation of the surface that can be detected by radar airborne or satellite monitoring. And for example, in the insular gas field, injection costs lifting of five millimeters per year. Fluid samples that provide the chemical variation induced by the injection, like the drop in pH and changes in the concentration of minerals due to the acidification provoked by the injection of CO2. And that allows the identification of possible CO2 leakage. The injection of tracers with the CO2 can generate a specific fingerprint of the stored CO2 because they can be detected by, with very small concentrations. Sulfur, hexafluoride, and methane have been used in depleted fields, and they provide an estimated CO diffusivity. This is some of the technologies that can be used to monitor the storage of CO2. Thank you. Thank you, Rodolfo, for that background. There are a lot of options and choices there for monitoring, which is very important for CCUS, also for storage. One final question for Sue, and then we're going to take questions from the audience. So, Sue, briefly, CCUS is a topic that crosses discipline boundaries. How can SPE members get involved in CCUS topics beyond subsurface technical issues? Great. Yeah, thank you, Simeon, for that question. And there are several ways that people can, SPE members can be involved. And the first would be around the technical sections. So, of course, there is a CCUS technical section, and any member can join any technical section. So even if you don't work in this area, but you want to learn more about it, that's an opportunity. In addition, the sustainable development technical section is one of those technical sections that has a broad group of people that are working on sustainable development issues or who are interested in them. There's a huge GAIA program around sustainable development topics. And so there are ways to contribute in that technical section. SPE has recently put in place a hydrogen technical section, so an opportunity there as well. Moving on to other benefits that SPE members have and ways to engage, energy stream. So this particular type of event that we're doing today, SPE has a video library that contains many, many different talks on CCUS. And so you can watch those at your convenience. And then we can't forget about the in-person events, the live events that SPE holds. So we have ATCE coming up next month. And that's a great opportunity if you haven't registered yet. There's still time to register and join us at ATCE. This month in August in Houston, there was an energy transition symposium. And so this topic was well covered in that symposium. And then later this year, there will be a collaboration between the sustainable development technical section and the Gulf Coast section regarding a decarbonization congress. So I think if you take the opportunity to look at all the offerings that SPE has, you'll find that there are many ways that you can get involved and contribute in this area. Perfect. Thank you, Sue, for that overview. Hopefully the audience can see that SPE is very involved in this topic and any other transition related topic, and they can get involved. So we're going to take audience questions now. And so let me start with the question number one from LinkedIn by Sorin. Wise Hartman, what percentage of emitted CO2 can be captured and stored? And this is for Sue. Yeah, so thanks for the question, Sorin. Right now, about 0.1% of the global CO2 emissions are currently being captured. That translates into about 45 million metric tons. The aspiration is that by 2030, we will have 1 billion metric tons captured and stored, and by 2050, several billion. So you can see that we have a ways to go to meet that aspiration by 2030. And we have to deploy many, many more projects. Perfect. Thank you for answering that question, Sue. We have another question from LinkedIn by Mohammed Navaid Khan. He's asking CCUS projects in the upstream EOR operations are challenged by the facility cost. Without a doubt, incremental oil recovery is achievable. But how to bring down the cost of facilities? What is the pipeline for that? Adolfo, do you have an answer for that? Well, yes, an advantage for using depleted reservoirs is that we have available infrastructure in the reservoir. We have pipelines, transporting pipelines, and we know the geological description of the reservoir. Those are important points to be considered. Perfect. Thank you for that, Adolfo. And I think we are at time. So we can do I'm going to ask Sue and Adolfo to say a few closing comments for SP live today. Adolfo and Sue, please. Closing comments, please. You want to go first? I'll go first. Okay. Thank you. This is it's been a pleasure to be a part of this SP live. And it's such an interesting topic that I hope more people will be engaged and help help our industry move this move this technology forward and introduce more projects. Thank you. Thank you, Sue. Adolfo, some final thoughts? Yes, it is necessary to further explore the benefit of OVOR in the to offset the part of the costs associated with CCS and to continue exploring the potential of saline aquifers to store CO2 and develop appropriate monitoring and mitigating plants, mitigation plans to allow timely reaction in the case of higher than expected leakage rates. Rates will occur during injection operations. I think that is my closing remark. Thank you, Adolfo and Sue. And thank you both for your time. This is a very important topic for our industry and for our sustainable future. And so I appreciate you sharing your expertise today with our audience. And I also want to thank the audience for their questions and comments and for joining us today. Again, I'm Simo De Burri and I'll see you next time. Thank you.

SPE Live Podcast: Accelerating the Energy Transition,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the SPE Live Technical Director Series. Challenges and questions to improve data analytics and machine learning applications in reservoir disciplines. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on February 1st, 2023. And now your moderator, Berond Endurk. Welcome to this SPE Live Technical Director Series on challenges and questions to improve data analytics and machine learning applications in reservoir disciplines. My name is Berold Endurk. I'm a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Houston. And 2017 to 2020 SPE Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Director. Today's SPE Live will last about 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions during the program. And I will shortly shortly introduce my guests over here to SPE directors. And the first one that I'm going to introduce here briefly is Rodolfo Camacho. He is a professor at National University of Mexico. He worked with PEMEX for 25 years and holds masters and doctorate degrees in petroleum engineering from University of Tulsa and bachelor's degree in geophysical engineering from National University of Mexico. He is currently SPE Reservoir Technical Director. So our second guest over here and technical director is Dr. Silvio Nivesco. He has recently moved to University of Texas at Austin after being the chief scientist of pressure pumping product line at Baker Hughes with fundamental and applied research, technology deployment and innovation experience related to subsurface engineering. He is also the 2020 to 2023 SPE Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Director. So we will start our live series right away over here. I'm the moderator, so I'm going to ask a number of questions. Of course, we will have an informal discussion board over here. Plus, we will add some of the questions from the audience, et cetera. And we have a couple of them that we want to go ahead and start the discussion over here in a way to ignite the entire thing here. So one of the questions that we are asked quite a bit, this is an aggregate of it actually of our industry or SPE as a whole. How can the DSEA, machine learning or artificial intelligence, whatever the combination that you want to take these words, link all technical disciplines that is reservoir. In fact, the specific case here is the reservoir drilling, completion, production, et cetera, actually. So we will start our discussion together. And what are the implications of this integration? I will start first with Rudolfo over here, and we'll go back and forth with Dr. Lavesco. Well, thank you, Viral, for the introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this SPE live again. In the context of energy transition, considering the capture and storage of CO2 as an obligation for monitoring safe storage, the reservoir becomes a liability. But if the CO2 is used for your purposes, then the reservoir will continue in an asset. In technical literature, there is a description of several processes that are present in the injection of CO2, like dissolution, geomechanics and rock fluid interactions. But there is still very little addressing the applicability and limitations of current models. There is a very good opportunity. There is a room for data analytics and artificial intelligence applications to CCS and CCUS to unlock the potential to accelerate these projects. Of course, for these applications, we need to have data consistently available. And for the case of hydrogen storage in hypermobility and porosity reservoirs, depleted reservoirs, again, we expect future data analytics and artificial intelligence applications in these projects. I will stop here with this response. Okay, great, great points, Dr. Camacho. So I see a couple of key points over here. You are seeing opportunities in terms of acceleration of the processes or what we are doing and also what we might be doing and what we are doing in the new areas. So from that point of view, it requires some type of an integration. And that's the key point of this question as well. What would you say about this entire concept behind this question, Silvio? Well, thank you, Birol. So first of all, hello, everyone. It's a great pleasure to be here with my friends and colleagues, Rodolfo and Birol. And I really appreciate the opportunity to talk again once a year for SPLive as a technical director. This is, I think, my third or fourth SPLive event. So a great question. You know, I can answer it in several ways. First of all, let me say that data science and engineering analytics, technical discipline has been created in SP exactly to address that kind of integration and the collaboration between all the other technical disciplines. Right. And so if you think about Reservoir, it's our largest technical discipline in SP. However, it's related directly to the other technical disciplines. And data science is exactly that technical discipline that bridges the gap and bringing together all the other technical disciplines into the Reservoir. Right. When I was at Baker Hughes, I remember just before I left, I traveled to North Sea, to the Middle East, and I talked with several operators at the time. And all of them actually were telling me that in terms of technology development, they felt that they were not that interested anymore at that time. And everything they were talking about was cost reduction of everything they were doing. And so since then, we have many case histories. We have many papers in SP. We have many operators talking about exactly that. Data science is integrating different technical disciplines as a way to reduce costs. Right. And we are going to address that in several ways today. But I'll stop here and I'll wait for more questions. Thank you. Thank you. Again, great to see my two of my colleagues over here again. And I'm going to ask one of the key questions over here that is discussed in various ways. And it's going to start with the main challenges. What are the main challenges? We talk about data science, data analytics, engineering, and we want to apply. What are the really main challenges in application of data analytics and machine learning to several reservoir engineering problems? I'm asking specifically for reservoir engineering, but of course, it's a problem for every discipline in terms of that. We are talking about that. What is the issue over here? I'll go backward over here now. I'll start with Silvio with yourself. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Birol. This is another great question that has been asked several times in the past. I remember different SP conferences and the answers are kind of similar. So there are many problems that we need to solve in reservoir engineering. And probably the most unsolved problem right now is we can prove commercial improvements because of our use or understanding of data. So the story actually, we come beyond machine learning, data science, and data analytics. And we have to think about the data analytics. All these great methods, actually, the stories that we come up with are very important for us as an industry, for our management, actually to understand the value of data we are bringing from the subsurface, from our reservoirs. So for instance, and I know that you mentioned that the data analytics are very important for us as an industry, for our management, actually to understand the value of data we are bringing from the subsurface, from our reservoirs. So for instance, and I know Rodolfo has a lot of things to say about this, but within our technical disciplines, reservoir and data science, we have a work group that is looking into coming up with some kind of data sets similar to the 10 SP comparative solution projects that were developed several years ago. So we have a work group that is looking into coming up with some kind of data sets similar to the 10 SP comparative solution projects that were developed several years ago. So we have a work group that is looking into coming up with some kind of data sets similar to the 10 SP comparative solution projects that were developed several, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, for the purpose of benchmarking all the reservoir simulators that were developed at the time. Pretty much all the operators had some kind of, you know, and vendors, services companies had some kind of, you know, initiatives to develop their own reservoir simulators. And so those 10 SP comparative solution projects were a way of our industry to benchmark the reservoir simulators and models. We need something similar right now for data science, right? So we need data sets, we need companies to come together and share data, either real data or synthetic data in a way for us actually to know what is beyond all the algorithms, all the, you know, models we have for data science and machine learning. Thank you, Rodolfo, please go ahead. Yeah, great points actually. This will go back to Rodolfo because we said reservoir engineering specifically. Let's hear from you. Yes. Well, thank you. There are many applications of data analytics and machine learning to several reservoir engineering projects. But there is a lot of common understanding and established guidelines for building robust and sustainable solutions. Besides the data issues that Silvio just mentioned, we don't know which are the appropriate modeling methods for specific problems. There is a shortage of skills and proper balance between physical understanding and data driven methods. It's still a big question. The literature has been emphasized that physics-based data driven approaches are more appropriate purely machine learning strategies. We need to know the strengths and limitations of each method. Those, I think, are the main challenges in the application of these tools to the reservoir discipline. Great points. What I take the takeaway points over here is that you want to accelerate the development and we want to go commercial, use and understand the data so that we can do something about it. And it fuses right away to what Rodolfo said over here is that you need the contact knowledge over here. So a machine is not going to do standalone. It sounds like that. And lack of understanding is an issue and sharing and robustness. So they cycle back to the culture of our current culture related to enabling environment. If I'm not, if I'm capturing the integrated response from both of you. So it will bring us the following question as a result, actually. What are the things that we do and we need to do in the context of energy transition, actually? Now, all this understanding and bringing a different scale and a time scale when we bring the carbon dioxide into the picture. Then we ask this question, is reservoir an asset or liability in the context of energy transition and how data and data science and machine learning can help us in terms of our obligations and surveillance, actually? So how can we address these questions and starting from today, actually? And I'll start with Rodolfo, actually. This time I flipped the order again. Well, in order to address this question that you posed, I think we need to try to answer some questions in the applications of data analytics and artificial intelligence in the reservoir model and performance prediction. First of all, depending on the type of model that we use, different types of an amount of data are needed. Data driven models like neural networks are not restricted to a certain type of data. But how are we sure that we have the representative, sufficient and good quality data? That will be the first question. Also, data driven models do not rely on any appropriate knowledge of the reservoir. Now, how can we be sure if our understanding of the current production process is sufficient to judge the quality of a history match, for example, with data driven models? Reservoir modeling approach is to capture the results of full physics simulations with a lower dimensional representation. To make optimization and uncertainty quantification of viable approaches, the physics model must be replaced by a data driven surrogate model. However, what will happen if the full physics simulator to generate a surrogate results uses some wrong assumptions and there is a misinterpretation of complexity. And this is very important for the related to the CO2 injection, looking for a safe storage of that CO2. And even with the reservoir production, we have the reservoir behavior, we have these questions and those will continue with the CO2 injection. And the storage of this CO2 has some uncertainties related to how well we know the physics of that system. And with that, I will stop. Thank you. Sounds great. It sounds like we are already doing it. Data quality is important. If we do a good job today, I guess we'll be doing a better job for the future, whatever the application might be. So I'll just go back to you, Silvio, and what are your points in the context of this question? Thank you. Thank you very much. So great comments, Rodolfo. What I would like to add is, in addition to everything you said, I will say that we need small wins. So it's a really reservoir simulation, especially using machine learning, data science. It's a really, really complex problem. We can easily spend our lives doing fundamental research and coming up with very complicated algorithms for predicting our reservoir performance. The problem is we don't know actually how far we are from reality. And probably that has been a problem in our industry for a long time. And so what we need to do is to look for small wins. Right. We need to prove that actually our approaches are right, have potential for improving our operations, our production, everything, our metrics. And I don't believe that actually one company now can solve everything. We need to look at our culture and our way of doing things. And so it's important actually for us to open up and start collaborating, you know, with everybody who is interested in coming up with these small wins. We are all in this together and I truly believe that we are not really competing against each other, actually. The operators really don't compete against each other. So why we don't open up and collaborate in terms of, you know, in our reservoir models using machine learning algorithms and data, sharing the data. That's probably the most important part that I want to stress today. It goes back to a great point. It goes back to again square one, sharing data and liberation of data. This goes into both of you what you highlighted. We have a great segue question from the audience here. I'll ask that one actually by Rosemary Amerskal. How can experts in reservoir discipline be involved in modeling and evaluation process to improve the accuracy and acceptance of data analytics and applications actually? This is in a way it sounds like either or type of a question actually. So what are your points actually? I'll start with you, Silvio, first on this one. So again, it goes to those small wins I was talking about. So I do believe that actually a very sharp focus on delivering results more than just continuing to come up with new algorithms with no practical applicability. And there are many papers like that, SPP Purpose recently, you know, that propose all kinds of very complex workflows and new algorithms. And at the end of the day, actually, I think those are all great. But, you know, an asset manager is asking, you know, how that is going to help me, you know, produce more oil, cheaper oil and things like that. And so we need to focus on the value we are bringing in with all these new approaches, right? And how they are applicable to our reservoirs. And second, what I would like to comment on again, it's our culture. We need to open up and we need to collaborate with the others because we just don't have time to spend another decade trying, you know, to come up with very incremental, small increments in improving our production. We are our industries under stress to lower the cost and to reduce our carbon emissions. And we cannot do that with the same, you know, models we had in the past. I'm talking about culture. I'm talking about business models. And I'm talking about our training models as well. Sounds like the old days of re-engineering over here. So, Rudolfo, any points on this? Yes, I agree with the points that Silvio has exposed. And I just want to stress from the reservoir side that we have many challenges that we have to really try to solve. If we think, which is the flow equation that we are using? It was from the 19th century and the continuity equation, again from the beginning of the 19th century, Fourier equation, Fourier continuity equation for the heat transport. Then we need to really think it's really a very interesting time that we are living. We have to try to solve. We know that the continuity equation, for example, has to use some derivatives with a fractional approach. From physics, we know that. And for unconventional reservoirs, we also know that the use of Darcy's law is no longer applicable. But knowing that, and that is what I was stressing in my previous interventions, that trying to emphasize that the physical understanding is, we are still missing that. If we don't really understand that and trying to go into data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, without taking into account that, it's just putting too much emphasis on the data, on the production data. And trying to, with that knowledge, trying to qualify the forecast that we're receiving from data-driven models, for example. That is difficult. In fact, one of the good points of the physics-based data-driven models is that it gives us the opportunity to understand the physics that is behind these results that data-driven models provide in us. But yes, we have to, it's a really interesting time in the sense that we have to address those reservoir challenges that we have, but at the same time, trying to introduce these technologies, data-driven models, and try to get both of them in an arm-to-arm relationship. And don't try to just be confident and say, well, these artificial intelligence tools are using, in many applications, those artificial intelligence tools. But we need to be sure that we know the physics of these reservoir problems. That will be my comment. Okay, great. So in summary, if I summarize it, in a way, if you only look at the production, you may miss what's happening in the reservoir and the physics-based flow and continuity equations. So basically, if I isolate that question, you go back in time to a decline curve only. But if you don't understand what's happening in the ground, it's hard for us to react to what happens or what we could do, actually. I don't know, I summarized in a couple of lines what you said, actually. And now we have another question from the, this question comes quite a bit, actually, especially from students. The question number two over here by Uzo Uwekwe, can you provide some opportunities in reservoir engineers or in engineering to upskill, to be able to apply data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning workflows? So I'll start with Sylvia, with you. And we continue with Rudolf after that. So in terms of opportunities, I'm guessing that it's in the context of our society as well as probably the company and the schools, actually. So I don't know what happened. Sylvia dropped out. So probably you can cover, we can change the order, Rudolfo, on this. Well, I, it's undeniable that there are many data analytics applications in all reservoirs of disciplines. And in the future, these applications will be even more frequent. The purpose of exposing the challenges that I mentioned is to emphasize that there are areas of opportunity that must be addressed and that some of them have to do with the teaching of petroleum engineering in the universities. Where it is convenient for students to be exposed to these applications. And what we need to consider is that in the petroleum engineering curriculum, many disciplines such as geology, for example, have participated. And now it's a turn of data analytics, machine learning, to be part of the petroleum engineering curriculum. It sounds like we start bottom up on this thing. But also we are in an era that a lot of webinars, various educational opportunities are freely available in the free media. Like, you know, you can freely access, in other words, like YouTube to LinkedIn to various places. And also the SP has various webinars and opportunities and courses as well for those short courses in certain that are tagged to certain SP events, actually, conferences, etc. But of course, if there's a demand as a society, we also react to that demand as well. So I'm not sure Dr. Livescu is going to be able to join or not. So we have one minute here to wrap up, I believe. I will check with our organizers here as well. That would be the final notes that you want to reach out to our audience over here, Rodolfo, while we are waiting for Dr. Silvio Livescu. Well, some of the challenges and questions that I have posed today have been expressed by some members of the Reservoir Advisory Committee. And what I want to let you know is that they don't have a simple solutions, but it is convenient to be aware of them, to have a better future applications of these technologies. It's important to know that there are some issues like the data, the quality of the data, how representative is the data, the quality, if that data is sufficient. And also the assumptions that are behind the reservoir models that we are using and also behind the data driven tools that we are using. It's important to be aware of that. That will be my message. Thank you very much. As an ex-TD of the Data Analytics and DSCA, I will do the wrapping on behalf of Silvio since he's not here. What I want to say is that we need expertise. All options are on the table to solve our complex problems. And it's not either or question. And we have a long way to go to improve all the processes that we are doing. And if we cannot integrate things physically, we can integrate them in data science a lot easier. Thank you very much. Thank you for all the listeners and people who are watching us. Thank you, SBE. Thank you, Rudolfo. Thank you, Silvio and our organizers. The SBE Energy Stream, the industry's digital pulse at streaming.spe.org. If you enjoyed today's show, don't forget to subscribe and review.

Tom, Jane, and George, welcome to this SPE Live. Thanks, Amin. Thanks, Amin. Great to be here. All right. Let's start with the first question for the panelists. Can any of you tell us about the objectives of the 2024 SPE Energy Transition Symposium and why is it an important event for the industry? Jane? Yeah, I can start, Amin. Thanks. It's going to be a really fantastic symposium. I think what's really important about this one is it's an opportunity to sort of pull your head out of the work that you're doing and share with others how you're progressing the energy transition, learning about different technologies, different solutions, and how industry is really progressing towards solving this dual challenge of that significantly reduces the environmental impacts and GHG emissions. So I think having this group of folks and experts from across the energy industry come together to talk about the different approaches being taken is essential to make progress on that. Yeah, Amin, absolutely. And to echo Jane's remarks, she's spot on. And we recognized early as we were building this that what we wanted was a renewable platform, right, to draw in those, including those outside SPE, to be joined the conversation, to extend it, to share knowledge, to transfer that technology. We wanted to bring together the experts in geothermal, CCS, hydrogen, renewables, bioenergy, etc. And let's get them all around the table and progress this together. And that was really our driving factor behind this. Thank you, George. Tom, do you have anything else to add? Sure. And like a bad politician, I'll answer the question I want, not the question that you gave us. Guys, we're still at the beginning of SPE's mission and energy transition. And we're going to be for a while. The low-hanging fruit, geothermal, CO2, hydrogen storage emissions, these are all reasonably well-defined and they're absolutely in line with SPE's members' skills and missions. The next level of CO2 capture, critical minerals, in situ, hydrogen, natural hydrogen, etc. They're also in our remit, but we'll need to collaborate out of our comfort zone. And we're going to have to accept a somewhat different risk scheme. Hopefully, we can have these kind of conversations here. This symposium, as George and Jane have mentioned, is really important to have those conversations. But this is not trying to be all things to all people, but rather to attract people with an interest and who are likely to be future contributors. In energy transition, and for anyone who's paying attention, we didn't pick the date. Okay. The second week of August is a real doozy. So I guess technically it's the third week, but I'll hand it back to you now, Simeon. Thank you, Jane, George and Tom for those sharing your objectives. I hope the audience can see why it's an important event for the industry and why they should register and join. How would you describe the current state of the energy transition with the oil and gas industry? What do you see as the biggest challenges the oil and gas industry faces in transitioning into a lower carbon future? And I'm going to direct this question to George first. Sure. So hopefully I don't take all the answers off the table, but at least provide enough runway for Tom and Jane to back me up. But I mean, we have the big three that Tom talked about. You have CCS, and that's thanks to the IRS 45Q incentive. That's progressing quite nicely. There's a lot of interest. Hydrogen storage is coming up behind. We do have active commercial efforts, small in the Gulf Coast with some transmission and then geothermal's burgeoning. And so what we see, you know, some of those challenges are kind of across the board. Transmission infrastructure is a challenge in the energy transition space. How do we build it out? How do we get public acceptance for some of these projects? This is what we're seeing. So CCS is at the front, and hopefully that with the public engagement and how we do that can hopefully blaze the trail and bring the rest of them along with it. So back to you, Simone. Thank you, George. And I'm going to allot Jane, if you have anything else to add on this question about the current state of the energy transition. Yeah, absolutely. You know, for the last two and a half years, the work that I'm leading it and the partnership really brings together the incumbent energy industry as well as new players in the energy industry to think about how we progress the transition and how do we do it in a way that continues to leverage the outstanding leadership and capability of this industry and use those things we know how to do well to scale solutions for the transition. And I think, you know, some of the challenges is how do we continue to meet growing energy demand and at the same time implement technologies? And some of the challenges to that are really around, you know, as George mentioned, permitting and getting transmission built and being able to execute on big projects. And the level of public acceptance around that has really changed over the last few years. And so how do we continue to work with communities and with the folks who are going to see and experience these projects happening in their part of the world and make sure folks understand what this is intended to do, why it matters and what it means for them. And so I think, you know, making sure that we all understand the realities of our energy system and understand the challenges and how we overcome those challenges and how do we leverage the things we do well today? But to the point that Tom made earlier, how do we sort of get out of our comfort zone and understand a different perspective as we are moving these projects forward? Thank you, Jane. Very insightful comment. Tom, do you have anything to add to this question about the current state from your perspective? Let's talk about SBE for a minute. You know, this is really the defining types of questions for SBE's energy transition missions. And the derivative questions are equally, if not more important. You know, what can we do now, which is what this conference is about? What will we do in the future, which is also part of our symposium? And then how are we willing to involve, you know, my kids and my students, they both hate me for saying this, but, you know, people define themselves by what they will not do. So let's admit we don't want to do some things and, you know, we may not be able to do others, at least not in the short term. We also need to be careful that we don't become an echo chamber. And that's where we all say the same thing, hoping it becomes a reality. And the hopes that we can make a vision, you know, that is a great idea, but we really need to focus on paths. These are pretty scarce. Personally, my fear is that SBE will focus on the visions and not the paths. And let me be direct. There's plenty of SBE members working on energy transition type topics right now. I was informed yesterday that about 15% of recent technical content is on CO2H2 storage and another 5% is on other new energy topics. These are small, but they're rapidly evolving. We just need to make sure that we focus on the paths as well as the visions. So thank you, Simeon, for letting us know that you're ready to go. Thank you for letting me make that comment. Very good. Thank you all for the insightful comments on these questions. I know it's on the top of mind for most of the audience and maybe SBE members and non-members. This is an industry topic. And of course, there's a lot of ways to call it. Energy transition is just one of the many, many ways. But as I'm listening to your responses, it sounds to me like energy in transition, there's a lot of moving parts. This is the way I would describe the word transition in my mind, that a lot of moving parts, moving from a current state to a future state, that is a lower carbon and is desirable for the industry. So I heard you guys mention CCUS in your remarks. My next question is about CCUS specifically. CCUS is a key topic at the symposium. How crucial is it CCUS, George, in achieving the net zero emissions? No, thank you, Simeon. And, you know, Jane was kind enough to remind us about this wonderful MPC study that was done several years ago. And when we worked on that study, it was a critical component then. And it's even more so now, depending on what your climate goals and targets are. To meet climate targets, you can't do it without CCUS. So that means whether you're capturing from large coal-fired power plants or gas-fired utilities, CDR methods to pull CO2 out of the air, moving that to geologic storage is a critical component. But it's not the only component. There's a bevy of other technologies that need to be in place to meet these climate goals. However, with IRS 45Q in place, there's a large interest moving this along. We're seeing the EPA has almost 150 well permits in their queue from roughly 50 projects. That excludes those primacy states, Wyoming, North Dakota, Louisiana, that have about another, oh, 50 wells, let's say. So we're looking at about 200-ish wells somewhere in that permitting structure. And the faster we can get these permits in place and online, the more those wells can be in place for reducing and meeting climate goals. So we're on our way. We're not there yet. We're getting there. But it's just an integral piece right now. Thank you, George. And I'm going to bring in Jane, in case you have anything else to add on this question about CCUS as a key topic. Yeah, thanks, Amanda. George is exactly right. We just literally can't get to the goals we want to achieve. And every credible report on climate change will tell you that we actually can achieve the goals we need to achieve without some level. And it varies based on perspectives, but without some level of CCS and CCUS being in the mix. And I think when I think back to 2019, when the National Petroleum Council study was published, I think the expectation was some of these technologies would take a long time to come down the cost curve and come into play. But I think we're already seeing CDR technologies, carbon removal technologies advancing. I also think what's been really interesting to me over the last two years is the you in CCUS is becoming a bigger part of the conversation. So whether we're talking about EOR, using the CO2 for products in the marketplace, or E fuels and sustainable aviation fuels, I think there is a lot of opportunity in the broadest concept of CCUS. But the S is absolutely essential in order for us to make progress quickly towards our carbon reduction goals, our GHG emissions reduction goals. We have to be able to get these projects that are in the queue, permitted and underway, so that we can really start to make significant reductions in CO2 emissions quickly. And it's great to see so many different projects in development and being worked. And I think, you know, as we are seeing those projects move forward, at the same time, there's a lot of great innovation and technology coming in behind it that's going to allow us to just keep building on what we know how to do and advancing those types of solutions for the future. Thank you, Jane, for those remarks. So if you don't know about CCUS, the Energy Transition Sympotion is definitely for you. And if you are a subsurface professional, you're probably very, very familiar with CCUS as it really takes the skills of subsurface professionals. So let's shift gears to another clean energy source, hydrogen. Hydrogen is often mentioned as a clean energy source. My question to you all is, what are the challenges and opportunities in scaling up hydrogen infrastructure, including, especially at scale, hydrogen generation? And I'm going to start with Jane on this one. Yeah, thanks, Simian. I'm certainly not an expert in hydrogen, but I think, you know, having Houston be selected as one of the hydrogen hubs from the DOE funding, I think, you know, we're starting to see a lot of projects come together in this market. And I think, you know, Houston has already been the leader in hydrogen development and utilization. And so this isn't new for us, figuring out how to do it in a low carbon way and produce more low carbon hydrogen and start to use it as a way to reduce reliance on oil and gas to power particularly high heat manufacturing processes. I think create really great opportunities in this market. I think the challenge is really around how do you create the demand and how do we build out the infrastructure that we need to be able to move hydrogen around and use it in the places where it makes the most sense to do so. And so I think it's really the marketplace build out the commercial build out of hydrogen as a fuel source and as a substitute for other higher emissions fuels that we need to figure out. And so I think we know a lot about how to make clean hydrogen from different sources, particularly by using CCS as a way to reduce the carbon intensity of hydrogen that's being produced today. And so we know how to do those things, but I think the real opportunity is in how do we how do we grow the markets where hydrogen can be a viable and valid and commercial fuel source for whether it's manufacturing activity, transportation activity or other power generation and other uses. So that's where I see sort of the biggest opportunity in hydrogen today. Thank you, Jane. And I'm going to bring in Tom to add some comments on the on this question on hydrogen. Tom. Thank you, Simeon. My answer is pretty quick and it's going to parallel a bit of what Jane said. And I'm sure that the George will also have similar comments. But my familiarity with hydrogen is basically as a chemical species and its nature and so forth. But as a fuel, we're going to evolve to that. And we'll talk about that some other time. I just want to comment that I watched a webinar a while back where the primary speaker was a banker and he commented literally, I don't know when or how hydrogen is a fuel will become mainstream. But as an investment, there's nothing better than hydrogen infrastructure. And I threw me back in my chair in a way because we all recognize that if you build it, they will come as an epitaph on a lot of things historically. But the reality is, is that hydrogen will be the future, the fuel of the future. I got to defer to others because I don't know what the timing of that is. But as Jane mentioned, we have a lot of ways of generating hydrogen and we'll need the infrastructure not only to generate it, but also to store and transport it. But the real question is, when does hydrogen become that fuel, the dominant fuel? And I think that's going to be quite a ways off. But again, I'll defer to the experts in it. But just to comment, the hydrogen infrastructure, as Jane mentioned, hydrogen projects, etc. are going to be very big investment projects in the near term. And of course, in the long term as well. Jane, you want to come back and correct me? Absolutely not. I would never dream of doing that. Speaking of reaching out to others, what, George, do you want to comment on hydrogen? Yeah, I'll take a little bit different tact. You know, where hydrogen is grown commercially in the US is where there's storage, right? And it's in salt structures. So let's look at the subsurface part where SPE does well, right? So we talked about transmission challenges across the energy transition space. So if you're trying to create a hydrogen hub, and let's say the Northeast, where you don't have salt dome structures in the subsurface to store in, you need to build a salt hub. You don't have a solid surface to store in. You need to build a dedicated transmission network. So we're going to have challenges with storage. We're going to have challenges with hydrogen and embrittlement with metals. We're going to have to overcome those. I think the learning is going along with those. There's a lot of projects being funded by the Department of Energy. Looking at hydrogen hubs, Jane talked about one. There's five or six of them across the US. And I think we're going to learn a whole lot in a very short period of time once these projects get up and running. And so I'll flip that back to Simeon. Thank you. Thank you, George, for those comments. We're going to take maybe a couple more and then we'll open it up for the audience. So another question I have here for you is how can the oil and gas industry attract and retain skilled workforce to support the transition to a lower carbon energy system? And I'm going to start with Jane on this one. Thanks, Simeon. And Tom will know my spiel on this pretty well because he has me come up and talk to his students at the A&M pretty regularly. But I think this is probably the most exciting time to be coming into the oil and gas industry. We are on the cusp of significant evolution of this industry and being in the front row seat and working on probably one of the most pressing issues that we face globally. I can't imagine it's a place that I'd rather be working right now. The folks that are coming into this industry and the folks that are thinking about this industry as a career are really, you know, they are at the front edge and will be the leaders making decisions around those paths. And what paths do we take and how do we solve this incredibly difficult challenge of more energy with fewer emissions? You know, we all know that access to reliable, affordable energy is what makes life possible around the world. It's what builds economies and it's what's allowed. It's what has allowed us to really advance everything that we do in the world. And so being a part of that industry and figuring out how to do that and how to do it well and how to do it with the least environmental impacts possible, I just think it's a really exciting time. But I think we also have to put the, we have to make the conversation accessible to young people so that they understand that this isn't an industry that has, that isn't interested in solving this challenge. This is an industry that's very much interested in being at the forefront and leveraging the leadership and the capability and the assets and the infrastructure to really, you know, advance the development of energy for the world in a way that also allows us to do it without the significant environmental impacts. And so, you know, like I said, Tom used to hear me give this spiel, but I think it's a really exciting time. There's just no better time to be coming into this industry. Yes, thank you, Jane, for those remarks. I'm going to take maybe a short ad if, George, you have anything to add. I'm going to open it up to the audience after these questions. So, George, any other comments on workforce? Just really briefly, and I think Jane's hit the bullseye. So I'm going to try to hit just stay in the dartboard. What I've been talking to professionals and petroleum engineering is be flexible. You know, you're not going to just do oil. You're not just going to do natural gas. You may do some geothermal. You may do some CCS. You may do some other things. Develop the skills across the world. You may do some geothermal. You may do some natural gas. You may do some natural gas. You may do some natural gas. You may do some other things. Develop the skills across the space. Make yourself a flexible addition to any team. And that's the way I see at least my teams and the industry kind of developing. It may change, but that's the way it looks now. Have some skills, plural. Tom, anything to add from your perspective at the university and academia side? So Jane brought it up and was very kind to mention that this is definitely our biggest challenge and our biggest opportunity. We're seeing tremendous growth in our undergraduate population. And, you know, what we tell them is you're going to have to have two mastery of two disciplines. Obviously, from my perspective, we want to have the best petroleum engineering education, geoscience education that we can have, because these support the energy transition. But what I'm going to say is that, you know, we will do whatever industry needs us to do. So we need a clear message from industry. You know, everybody always says, oh, you know, academia is lagged by four years or five years. That's true. But given some guidance and that's sort of what my plan is, is to look at petroleum engineering as a true focus area for next, I don't know, five to 15 years. Companies have similar windows. And then to think about how we transition. But I also want to say that we cannot give up our mother science anytime soon. You know, we again, I'll repeat that what we really need to do is focus on having the best talent, training them, educating them, creating the professionals of the future. They'll be able to adapt. They'll be able to handle two, maybe even three major disciplines or major skill sets. And we would hope that new energies would be one of those. I just want to say that at the moment, you know, what people are doing is they're self deciding. They're looking at their skills and deciding whether or not they want to go into new energy. At some point, that will probably be a path that's more clear. And, you know, we we have a lot of content that we're creating for the education side. But I think we need to have a more clear path. The unfortunate thing is people will then be schizophrenic and say, I'm either going to be a petroleum engineer or I'm going to be this new energy engineer. But actually, I think they will do both. And I would I would argue that that's what we're educating people for. That's what we're attracting and retaining people for as well. So I went over time on that, Simeon, but I really want to advocate that education is a place where I think you're going to see the evolution happen in the most substantive way. Thank you, Tom. I know you everyone on the panel has a lot of passion around the workforce and about the people side of the energy transition. So let's just go ahead and take maybe a question from the audience in the interest of time. We have a question from Amanda Scott. Amanda is asking, can you speak to the challenges of injecting CO2 or other gases, liquids currently in Texas, Texas experiencing earthquakes? And while operators submit permits for CO2 injector wells, have they created a plan for earthquakes? So can one of you comment on this question from Amanda? George, you're the expert here. I hate to throw this at you, but you really have the most familiarity with this particular issue. I will jump in and say that the difference is the way we're designing these these projects for CO2 injection. But after that, I hand it off to George. The likelihood of seismicity issues is much smaller because of the design constraints. But take it away, George. Yeah, and specifically with Class 6, what they're looking at is the seismicity history, maybe some geomechanics analysis, the rock types, the location, location, location. Right. If you're if you're being facetious here about where you position a project, soft rocks are less likely to generate earthquakes than hard rocks. If you're sitting on crystal and basement, you may want to take a harder look at this issue. And I know we're running late on time, but, you know, Mark Zoback at Stanford has done a lot of work in this space, you know, to kind of to ping another professional within SBE. So back to you, Sidney. Thank you, George. And of course, in the interest of time, we would would kind of start our wrap up. So I want to take some time to thank our panelists, Jane, George and Tom for an astounding SBE live discussion and dialogue in anticipation of the energy transitions in portion. So if any of you have any final messages brief, we can do so just to make sure that they give the opportunity to to say your final message very briefly, please. I'll make mine brief. Mark your calendars. 12, 13, 14 August. See you there. OK, George. I have to Tom, you know, hey, come engage with us. Let's have some discussion and we look forward to seeing you in Texas in August. OK, Jane, anything? Yeah, thanks. Thanks so much. I always feel like the least technical person in the conversation, but I appreciate the opportunity. I think expanding the conversation with SBE to to more of a non-technical audience and approach to the different perspective is really what this energy transition symposium will be about. And I'm really looking forward to it. Perfect. Thank you all. And thank you for watching this preview of the 2024 SBE Energy Transitions in portion. Stay tuned for more updates and we hope to see you there together. Let's just drive the energy transition forward. I'd like thank you for all your questions and comments and for joining us today. Again, join us in 2024 transition in Houston, Baytown on August 12 to 14. And I will see you next time. Thank you. If you enjoyed today's show, don't forget to subscribe and review. Join us next time on the SBE Live Podcast."
"SPE Live Pre-ATCE Series: What Do Leaders Need to Know, and Do, to Improve Safety Culture?","Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Chemical Considerations of CCUS and New Energy Development. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on March 8th, 2023. And now your moderator, Mike Fuller. Good morning. Welcome to this SPE Live event on Chemical Considerations of CCUS, New Energy Development. My name is Mike Fuller. I'm a senior completions SME with Chevron and I'm going to be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live is going to last about 30 minutes. We do encourage you to ask questions throughout the program and you can add those into the Energy Stream chat box that you'll see there. For our topic today, our audience can appreciate that the field of new energy development has a lot of new energy sources whose development are being explored in parallel. And development of a lot of those energy sources have challenges related to both chemistry and geochemistry that could benefit from the expertise of a lot of current upstream professionals within the SPE community. So before starting our conversation, I'd like to first invite you to attend the SPE International Conference on Oil Field Chemistry on the June 28th and 29th in the Woodlands, Texas. We welcome your participation in the ongoing dialogue throughout the conference program about current trends in oil field chemistry and emerging energy topics. For the last 50 years, the SPE has brought together technical experts from the oil field chemistry field of operators, chemical and service providers, and academia to share the latest developments in this field. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest panelists who are joining today. Stephanie Peat is a Laboratory Manager for Scaled Solutions USA based in Sugarland, Texas. She has a Master's in Science and Chemistry from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, which includes industrial placement and formation chemistry and a thesis study of absorbent materials for water purification and CO2 capture. She joined Scaled Solutions in Scotland 10 years ago where her focus has been on production chemical testing and analysis in predominantly oil field applications. Our next guest is Ian Rowe. Ian is a Technology Manager with the U.S. Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies office within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In this capacity, Ian is responsible for assisting with the overall strategy of the office on numerous activities as well as managing a diverse applied R&D portfolio that focuses on decarbonization of fuels and chemicals. Specifically, Ian manages projects in CO2 utilization, biochemical conversion of biomass, and carbon management. Stephanie, Manika, Ian, welcome to this SPE live event. We're going to start with carbon capture, utilization, and storage or CCUS. While capturing CO2 alone presents some interesting challenges, injecting that material to downhole reservoirs can produce some additional challenges in how CO2 reacts with both the formation and some of the well construction materials downhole. Stephanie, you're going to be presenting at the 2023 Oil Field Chemistry Symposium on some new and novel lab testing techniques to look at CO2 in the formation interface. Can you briefly describe for us some of the flow assurance challenges that may be anticipated in CCUS, particularly for storage considerations, and how we can address them with experimental techniques? Hi, Michael. First of all, I'd like to say thank you for inviting me to be part of today's event. I think it's very appropriate that we're sitting having this conversation when the first cross-border offshore storage initiative goes live today in Europe. It's called Project Greensand. In regards to your question, there are many correlations and transferable reference points that we can take from CO2 EOR injection. However, there is still a considerable gap in our bridging our knowledge and understanding when it comes to CCUS storage. The EOR systems will display quite different flow assurance risk profiles in the sense that they are single high-pressure injection sources going into high-temperature, high-pressure reservoirs. This will not necessarily be the case for CCUS. The challenges faced by CCUS operations will include the potential of fluctuating injection volumes, pressures, and rates because it's coming from various sources. The injected CO2 will ultimately have varying impurities and quantities of such impurities, again because of the various industrial processes that it's being sourced from and also as byproducts from the capture process. We will be injecting into storage place at temperatures much lower than those observed in hydrocarbon-rich formations. We also have the continued and prolonged exposure of the injection casing and the well-bore materials to the acidic CO2 compared to, for example, WAG operations. The aim here will be that once we hit goal, we will not be wanting to stop at any point. The flow assurance risk considerations are all the usual suspects in regards to scale, corrosion, hydrates, halides, geochemical, and geomechanical. However, they must be approached with a different viewpoint on the conditions in which they arise when it comes to CCUS storage and injection. One example is injectivity information damage risk potential of CO2 hydrate formation at the near well-bore. They can form as a result of Joel Thomson temperature drops associated with the injection of high-pressure CO2 into lower-pressure reservoirs or the injection of high-pressure CO2 into shallow reservoirs of sufficiently low temperatures. Now, where hydrate risk has widely been researched in oil and gas over the years, the majority of that research has been done using testing techniques which replicate its bulk formation in tubulars. It has rarely been assessed under dynamic flow conditions using core samples which replicate the porous environment of the formation. CO2 hydrates specifically have also been investigated within CCUS, but again, this is in regards to its utilization for transportation. There's been very little assessment on the near well-bore risk that they pose. So the topic of work that I will be presenting at this year's symposium will exhibit the design, building and use of testing equipment capable of assessing CO2 hydrate formation risk and subsequent mitigation in low-temperature core flood tests in the lab. Now, the initial tests conducted have used brain as a chemical carrier for the hydrate inhibitor, but what we need to consider is the fact that the only carrier that may be available during these processes is the CO2 itself. So what we must then look to do is assess chemical product performance in this medium and develop the best practice methodologies to do so in the lab before we go to the field. Now, that's fantastic. I'm looking forward to hearing more about that study at the upcoming symposium. Thanks for that stuff. So our next question is going to be for Ian. What are some of the key goals or specific programs that we might expect to see in the next five years out of DOE in the area of CCUS? Sure. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for having me here. Always a pleasure to talk about this stuff. I would say that the department was given a pretty clear mandate from the legislative branch was that in late 2021, in front of the bipartisan infrastructure law, which laid out a lot of different programs that are now new to the Department of Energy on CCUS. A few of the big ones are we have mandate to set up carbon capture demo projects. This is in our new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and this is a significant amount of money to set up six carbon capture sequestration facilities with recommendations for some to be from natural gas, electric generating units, coal generating units, and industry facilities. So we have the demo projects. There's also a significant amount of funds also in the clean energy demonstration realm for pilot of more innovative carbon capture large scale pilots. And we also have our regional DAC hubs, and that's for regional direct air capture hubs. So another three to four billion dollar program in the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations with the idea really here to fund hubs that can remove and sequester approximately a million tons a year of carbon dioxide from direct air capture. So there's a clear mandate on that, both capture and removal side and on the U part of CCUS, which is the part that I have the most expertise and experience in, is on the utilization piece. There are several programs across multiple offices at DOE, the Office of Fossil Energy, the Bioenergy Technologies Office, ARPE, Office of Science. All of these are all the way from fundamental research all the way through demonstration on utilization to turn carbon dioxide into fuels and chemicals. Namely, there's this new consortia set up at the national labs on CO2 reduction and upgrading for E fuels. And the idea there is how do you leverage renewable electricity and carbon dioxide to turn it into fuels and chemicals? And that can all be wrapped up in other initiatives we have at the Department of Energy, like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grant Challenge, the idea that we need to get up to 36 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by the year 2050. And we can use a lot of biomass feedstocks to meet that need, but there's only so much biomass. We need to look to other feedstocks like carbon dioxide. So that's one initiative helping us there. And as well as back to the carbon capture and sequestration side, we have our carbon dioxide earth energy earth shot, which is around the goal of $100 per ton carbon dioxide removal by the year 2031, I believe. So there's a lot of R&D underway right now to try to hit that goal. Wow, that's fascinating. Sounds like a wide suite of work. And we appreciate you sharing some of that with us. So at this point, since there's so many different topics under this area of new energy, I'm going to move on to talk a little bit about hydrogen. So Ian, this question will go to you again. So when thinking about development of hydrogen as an energy source, the first questions that really come up are related to safety and monitoring. So Ian, you had recently moderated a webinar that talked about hydrogen, some of these considerations. Can you comment either based on some of that webinar or based on your ongoing work about some of that work at the DOE to explore really specifically safety and transport hydrogen from a chemical standpoint? Yeah, great question. Yeah, very important because hydrogen, while very energy dense on a per mass basis, it's extremely not energy dense on a per volume basis. So you've got to shove it in and really cram it into a vessel. And then you have something very flammable under a pressurized vessel. So the safety implications are clearly very important. I would say the leading platform we have to understand the safety and risks associated with hydrogen storage and transportation would be the hydrogen risk assessment model. It's a state of the art hydrogen safety model and data platform. And it really is built to put all of the R&D that has gone on at the national labs and everywhere else associated with understanding those risks into the hand of industrial partners and researchers. So this has led out of Sandia National Labs and it takes information like the frequency and probability data for hydrogen component failures like embrittlement, some models on hydrogen gas and flame behaviors, what happens to gas plumes as they escape from certain holes or fissures, really taking all of that information including ignition probabilities and stuff into a model so that somebody can assess the risk of it if they have a good understanding of the model. It's not to designate whether or not a certain project or activity is safe, but just to add more understanding so everybody knows the risks involved. There's a good example of this at work is the team at Sandia had a collaboration with the state of Massachusetts to understand the risk associated with transporting hydrogen in some underground tunnels there because the obvious risk there is if hydrogen is leaking, it's in a tunnel, does it build up and explode and do you have a big problem? And working together with Sandia they were able to get a real understanding of the risk there and realized that there's actually a lot of room to do such an activity with some relative safety. That's great. Thank you for sharing that, Ian. And certainly I think when it comes to some of the tunnel and construction challenges, certainly in the upstream oil and gas space there's a lot of expertise in that already. So I think there's definitely some great synergies that I'm glad that some of the folks who have joined us online can learn about regarding that work. So fascinating. Thank you for sharing it. I'm going to do a quick pivot a little bit to talk about something that I think is really important for the broader SBE audience, specifically some of the young professionals. And in that I want to talk a little bit about skills gaps and careers and the development of new energies. So Stephanie, I'm going to pick on you first really ultimately. So as a young professional, what would you say are some of your expectations of kind of responsibilities you might face and maybe skills you might need to develop related to energy sources, new energy sources as you progress in the future? Okay, well first of all I'd like to say thank you for considering me a young professional still. In regards to like experiences and responsibilities, my background is a chemistry degree. We had lots of choices on what we wanted to specialize in, but I could never decide. So I went for the general one and I just think the transferable skills that a science or engineering degree provides someone just gives them so much options in the future for what they want to focus on. The only PhD I ever considered doing was one, a CCUS one provided by the University of Edinburgh. They've been providing that for over 10 years now. But PhDs aren't necessarily for everyone. So I think just in regards to my scientific point of view for young professionals, I think it's absolutely invaluable of just getting your foot in the door somewhere and getting these strong background based knowledges in regards to best practice for work in the lab, good lab practices, all that kind of thing. It builds up strong foundations for when you do want to start focusing on various different energy streams and things like that. And then it's just a case of being up to date with what's going on in the industry. It's all very much independent research and reading articles and seeing what grabs your interest. Very good. So I think it sounds like you're saying that at any point in your career, the key is to be kind of a lifetime learner and I think to continue to stay fresh in what's being done and to kind of try to adjust with that. So that's a great share. If it's okay, and Ian, can you give me a thumbs up that you can hear us? Good. So with you back, we're going to ask you one more question also in the similar space of my previous question on careers and career development. So I'm familiar that DOE has got an internship program for early career professionals to learn a little bit or to dabble in the space of new energies. Can you tell us a little bit about that program? And then we'll get to some audience questions. Sure, Mike. I'm also noting that you didn't call me a young professional, so I'm going to remember that. But I would say DOE has a plethora of different programs to try to get new people involved, people fresh out of school, or even people already established in their career who want some experience in some different energy topics. First, I would cite the student ORISE program, Oak Ridge. Apologies, I forget what the acronym stands for, but it's an internship program specifically focused at students just out of school. And I've worked with many interns through that program, and they're people that I consider, for instance, day, and they've gone on to have very successful careers in either the national lab system, out in industry or academia, or at DOE itself. So that is a lucrative route. And there's also a lot of fellowships regarding a lot of routes for things like the AAAS fellowship, the presidential management fellowship. These are all things that I would explore if you're a young professional looking for a way to get involved with DOE, as well as we've plenty of technology commercialization type activities where the goal here is really to connect people in industry or academia that have a new technology, but they don't have the funding to, they need more support to get it out into the commercial sphere. They can come in, work with the national lab, get some support from DOE, and they can move that technology forward if they can get some R&D funds to do that. Yeah, fantastic. And thank you for sharing that. So I'm going to pivot at this point to some questions online. And the first question we can put to just about anybody. So the question through LinkedIn, and it is, what are some of the most promising chemical processes for CCUS and new energy development? And really, what are some of the key challenges with scaling them up for large scale implementation? So if anybody wants to tackle that, I would encourage you guys to take a crack at it. Ian, do you want to go ahead? Sure. I'll go first. And Mike, I'll be honest, I lost you in the middle there for a second, but I think I got the question. So in terms of near term, I'll focus on the utilization side, near term routes are really helped by recent things from the Inflation Reduction Act. There was a tax credit in there that gives up to $3 a kilogram for the use of renewable hydrogen in a pathway. So you can envision a utilization strategy that takes carbon dioxide and combines it with hydrogen to make a fuel. And the fact that a lot of fuel pathways that you CO2 need in the order of two kilograms of hydrogen per gallon of fuel, you can see how this could very quickly scale up to be quite a lucrative tax credit instead of so I would say that look for things that are already established technologies, for example, reverse water gas shift is an established technology that we know how to do that need a lot of hydrogen. And there's ample supplies of carbon dioxide out there. So I could see a near term opportunity for that to really take off in routes like that. Fantastic. Thanks for sharing that, Ian. I've got another question that popped in as well. Let me make sure I've got this right. Okay, so this question actually is going to go to Stephanie. I mean, we're going to be back on geothermal a little bit. So you talked a little bit about flow assurance as well. So can you briefly talk about some of the flow assurance challenges we might expect unique to geothermal wells and how we can address them using experimental measures? Thank you for the question. So for the geothermal, what we're basically looking at is the other end of the extreme temperature spectrum. Previously, I was talking about low temperature for hydrates. Now we're looking at the higher temperatures which will be experienced. This will result in much quicker scaling kinetics driven by the temperature differences between the saturated reservoir brines and the cooler surfaces they'll experience during processing. This poses a higher risk coupled with the difficulty to manage it chemically because scale inhibitors will thermally decompose at such high temperatures. One of the main scaling risks anticipated to experience is the formation of a more facilitated scale. It's anticipated to occur in almost all conventional high enthalpy geothermal operations along with calcium carbonate. This scale may be the main issue limiting the extent of geothermal exploitation. It's very difficult to inhibit effectively and it's insoluble in any practical solvent. Its formation must be prevented by controlling the degree of temperature fluctuations that are experienced during the flow of tea extraction processes. The standard testing equipment available in the oil and gas industry in regards to qualifying performance and application of production chemicals max out around 200 degrees C. Geothermal experience will be much higher than this. Any chemical products that will be applied in the field to assist in full assurance or integrity preservation need to be tested appropriately in the lab at these temperatures before any field application. Very good. So what this requires is equipment redesign and material selection basically at the lab stage. Very good. Thank you for sharing that. I think with that we are at the end of our SBE live session. So first of all I want to thank our panelists Stephanie and Ian. Thank you guys so much for your insights. And to our audience to learn more about these topics I do encourage you to come to the upcoming SBE International Conference on Oil Field Chemistry this coming June in the Woodlands, Texas. So again to everyone thank you for your questions and comments and for joining us today. We'll see you next time. Thanks for listening to the SBE live podcast.

"SPE Live Podcast: Digital and Physical Core Analysis: Data Comparison, Integration, and Challenges","I'm Jason Notouris and this is SPE Talks 2. Shana Noonan. Hello everyone. 2020 SPE President Shana Noonan joining us on the phone which is becoming our latest tradition for this podcast. Some things changing since our last episode but many of us still working at home. Some of the restrictions being lifted a little bit. We're gonna get into some of what we've learned from the last downturn that's helped us moving into this downturn and how it's affecting both SPE and the industry as a whole. I really like the title of this episode that you have that comes with the column and that's SPE staying strong. Column is available in the MayJPT and online so for those listening there is a link in the show notes if you want to read it. So Shana I'm actually just even trying to picture you trying to write this article because I'm sure that this is not what you imagined writing even a couple months ago but it is a strong vulnerable message that many I think need to read or in our case here on the podcast listen to in these unprecedented times. Well Jason when it came to writing my May column you know this was towards the end of March and we for most of us around the world had been in lockdown for one to two weeks and every day there was not the greatest news that we wanted to hear every morning and it just seemed that that with the pandemic and the crash of oil prices just things just kept getting seeming worse and worse and I really struggled to write this column in the fact that in the end was able to really have something positive to say but you have to understand too with our members you know I'm reading posts and getting emails from members and there's so much emotion there's anger there's fear there's sadness and the thing is is I wasn't only seeing it within the members I was seeing it within myself but even with all that stress and sadness and uncertainty when I'm looking as to SBE itself the our events that we love to network and engage they're getting postponed they're getting canceled and financially I'm just seeing the negative impact to our balance sheet increase every day and obviously no company or organization could have predicted this double whammy of the viral pandemic in the lowest oil price and just to educate our members too as a board about every five years we actually go through an exercise on risk assessment and the last one we did was in 2013 when I was actually on the board and the four things that we saw at that time being the highest risk that we put the highest priority as to trying to minimize the impact was one was business liability I mean you know that includes decline in membership event attendance and then there was the second theme of strategic decision-making how having poor strategy could impact risk this actually led us to making sure especially at the board level we have the right skill set and the right people to be serving on the board to not only think strategic but to really make sure that we stay focused on our strategic plan and for any of those to have a goal to eventually serve on the SBE board start looking within yourself and and making sure that you you have those skill sets and you're making them known because being on the SBE board is not a service award just because you give a lot of service to the society doesn't necessarily mean you might have the right skill set at the board level okay that's where I went on a little tangent and then the third theme around risk was the information technology viability how robust and effective SBE technology systems are and that's actually something we're continuing even right now to make sure that we're upgrading some of our IT platforms that have become obsolete and just making sure that within all our programs whether it's membership databases event planning softwares and stuff that we're able to be flexible because in this industry and with these cycles we have to be as flexible as possible and finally the fourth theme around the risk to SBE was making sure that we have good key performance indicators but usually in order to do that you have to have good data to be able to have relevant metrics and again that goes back to making sure that the IT systems that we have that we're still making sure that they are up to date that they're able to collect the data that we need in order to have good key performance indicators I guess that's one thing I want our members to know with a level of confidence is we're constantly looking at the threats to the society and making sure that within our strategic plans we actually mitigate or minimize those but again no one even outside of oil and gas can see this demo whammy of the COVID-19 and oil prices but what I do want members to know is because we have a board that had a great strategic plan and was following it through SBE was so much better prepared to service members at this time than we were during the last downturn and even with this being so unpredictable what's happening right now throughout the world being able to handle our current circumstances wasn't without obstacles you went through the strategic plan but on top of that there were also lessons learned during the 2015 downturn and that played a role in how SBE was able to respond today so in my column I give a shout out to those that served on the board in 2016 and 2017 who weren't basically tasked with ensuring the SBE at that time was able to ride out that downturn and it was a very difficult time for those that were on the board I had already rolled off midway through 2015 so I wasn't in the trenches as they were but you know they had really look at eliminating or reducing a program that some of our members wanted but financially we couldn't justify them especially with the loss in event revenue and event revenue even though we're a non-for-profit our event revenue is so important because it they provide approximately 70% of the total revenue needed just for our society to keep the lights on and keep the existing programs running and also at that time it was necessary for the SBE organization to reduce staff which is something none of us want to ever consider but at that time when they were looking at the organization really how can we make it more efficient and run more lean and along with that they managed to streamline the divisions between the different regional offices because years back it in some cases the regional offices almost act acted like their own little entities and there wasn't a lot of collaboration between but since that last reorganization during the last downturn it's and it's pretty seamless I make a point of visiting our regional offices when I travel and it is amazing how much more effectively and collaboratively they are running now so when the industry started to correct itself during that last downturn and our events we started bringing in more revenue and this is when I started coming back on the board again we are really making sure that we remain cautious on our spending and not going back to doing things the way we were before the downturn and by making sure that we are already effective and lean per se if we were already in a financially and organizationally better position this year with this double whammy of the coven and the oil prices than we were before to make sure that we can deliver on our mission of collecting disseminating and exchanging technical knowledge between our members you mentioned the collaboration with the other offices and regions just this morning as we're recording this podcast my early morning their late evening I'm on a call with Kuala Lumpur yesterday I was on a call with the Dubai office and because of the situation that we're in now working at home and actually just feels like it's someone that's down the street easy to reach easy to communicate with and one reason SPE among many other companies is able to make some of these changes I think now is due to the technology that is available that maybe wasn't as prominent even a half decade ago so working from home is more manageable employees across departments are more knowledgeable about digital strategies and information and I think that's playing into everyone's hand very nicely but I would love to hear you elaborate a little bit more on what SPE is doing in that arena well I have been very proud of how quickly we manage to adapt our services and programs to our members while everybody is in lockdown for example the distinguished lecture our wonderful distinguished lectures from this year had to cut their tour short because obviously we weren't able to travel and they managed to either do live webinars or tape webinars and basically do virtual DL visits you know there's been 16 completed as of last week and there are still 34 out there to be done and really I think for the future of the DL program I really think that it's going to be a hybrid areas where we can string together a tour a section visits and areas that are open to travel we'll have our deals be in person usually if a single section in a region is the only one that wants that DL typically that deal doesn't get sent because to make it economically justifiable we need them to visit a bunch of sections in that region I know of one deal in the past my mentor John Patterson he actually never ever did a section visit because his particular topic there they couldn't get more than just one section in a region that wanted him to speak so if John then had the technology we have now where he could be doing virtual DL visits for these one-off sections then that we're actually reaching more of a member so this is where I really think the future of the deal programs going now don't quote me because again we are an organization run by members this is something that's going to have to be discussed within the distinguished lecture committee as well as the board level but I really think something some good outcomes going to come from this and then we have our student paper contest we had several of them that hadn't hadn't come into place yet before the lockdown and we've actually managed to run or planning to run them virtually Canada Africa is going virtual the Middle East South Asia with a student paper contest so I think that has been very good and just to let people know that the international level for the student paper contest ATCE that is actually also going to be virtual there's going to be some changes made within that especially when it comes to how the event is judged because now it's no longer in person at the virtual well I also think with some of the virtual that you're mentioning this helps with some travel visas to with people who sometimes have not been able to make trips to some of these events where they could be presenting a paper or participating in a contest like this oh yes and actually just not with the student paper contest but with petro bowls even our events coming into the future we now have the ability because of the technology and the platforms that we're rolling out to still allow members that can't travel because of visa restrictions to be able to either live-stream that content or get it pretty close to near time so our webinars you know our webinars have been around for many years or probably almost a decade and it's been interesting to see the statistics from this spring as opposed to previous years and that's as far as usage so in April of 2019 so a little over a year ago we had 1,872 people register for a webinar just last month we had over 9,600 so that's five times the number of people while maybe it could be just one person that's also an access in a whole bunch more webinars but it's five times the amount of webinar registration that had been used and it's absolutely fantastic and I really hope that this is attracting people that normally didn't utilize member benefits with the webinars and they're now really seeing the value in that so hopefully these numbers will continue to expand I personally I can't wait to see what the the main numbers are going to be like but you know again this has been absolutely fantastic and then of course all our social media streams FBE has a social media account on LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Instagram and YouTube and just to give you an idea for example in April we had over 27,000 engagements of people on the FBE LinkedIn account Facebook over 15,000 Instagram and Twitter you know over 5,000 and these are numbers that are continually going up and we're seeing more and more people start to follow FBE social media accounts which is fantastic because right now we've been rolling out a lot of live streaming events on these social and media accounts and it's been fantastic there was one yesterday I was just seeing the thousands of people and see this hello from Nigeria and the next person would comment saying hello from Argentina it was absolutely fantastic being able to reach out through these platforms but again these are all public accounts so the people that are accessing these aren't necessarily FBE members because you don't have to be a member to get on them but we're hoping that the non members that are accessing these live stream events that that will actually encourage them to want to they start seeing the value in becoming an FBE member and that actually will drive membership growth and you can talk about these live streams from the first eight that were produced more than 4,000 hours worth of live video was watched just in those eight combined SPE live events you calculate all those hours and that equals almost 180 days worth of SPE content that's been viewed by this audience wow and then this is just the FBE International you know the sections now are utilizing this as well yeah I think really looking at it overall SPE is identifying what can we share to the public that is unique to SPE let's not be something that blends into the wall let's stand out and be the voice that is heard and from from what I've heard from the social media team it's a good problem to have too much content from which to select and that that's where SPE is right now because of how much the members are coming forward with their stories and sharing their experiences and I think it's great that we have so much content to select from to be able to share to the public into the members across our platforms to be able to say here's where we are here's where we stand here's who SPE is we also really need to talk about what are we doing for our current members who have either been furloughed or have lost their jobs and so a program that we created during the last downturn the members in transition we've not only have reactivated it but we have been adding to what's available within it and for those that don't know if you're an SPE member who has unfortunately lost their job you can contact SPE and you can be given a waiver for up to two years on your dues and then you get exclusive access to a lot of tools to help you find new employment and one of the things that we just did it was on the suggestion of an SPE member Jeannie Purdue from Gulf Coast section she had posted on SPE connect though why don't we utilize one of those communities not only for members for transition but have a job board a place for our members to post their not only the resumes but also for people looking to hire that they can also post those jobs that just went live a few days ago and but we were able to quickly turn it around to have that internal job board and again that's exclusive for SPE members non SPE members cannot access those communities if you know of somebody who has been caught in this unfortunate situation please let them know that this program exists and what we're also doing too even for those that may still have their jobs but maybe had to have pay cuts their companies who normally would allow them to expense the registrations are no longer doing it due to financial constraints we're actually reaching out to those that aren't able to renew their dues this year and offering discounts so and we've been messaging that out to the sections if you are still have not renewed yet please reach out to your local section or go out to the SPE website and to get more information about that now another thing we also did to service our members was we reduced the price of papers and one petrol they used to be nine dollars and fifty cents US dollars and we've been able to reduce it to five dollars now this is one of the comments I get a lot is why can't we just offer SPE papers for free and one petrol and I think there's a misunderstanding that one petrol is a SPE platform one petro is actually a consortium of 21 different publishing entities that all have a very complicated revenue sharing agreement and so at least what we've been able to do is we've been able to drop our part of it as much as we can for our SPE members SPE does not have the power to just overtake all those other entities and change up the fee structure but this is something that was very proud that we did and we're not only we not only did it just for these few really rough months this is going to be the price of the one petro papers through to end of this year so I think that is fantastic and then let me talk about three other programs that we've been really utilizing and what I mean we we've seen it within the members obviously this platform that we're talking on now the SPE podcast and so since the very first podcast at ATCE last year with George King we have now what 29 plus episodes and the last I looked they've been listened to over 22,000 times which is actually fantastic and I have to give a shout out to Sid Smith Jr. who is one of the few people listening to my podcast and he sent me an email just a week ago saying hey Donna where's your next podcast we're waiting so that made me feel good that at least I know I got one person listening to this well if he's listening at least a hundred times each then yes there's only a few but you're you're getting some hundreds in there Shauna he is one of many and then we have again the suggestions from our members we listen to you and if we can we will try and implement your ideas as quickly as possible and one of them was the SPE state strong series one of our members in the Middle East now she used to be our former chair of the women in energy committee for the SPE international she posted something on Twitter saying Shauna why don't you do a variant of your SPE strong platform and do a series of short videos or uplifting messages for the members called SPE stay strong so staff was able to quickly amass video content there's actually three videos that have been added each week and you get this exclusively through the SPE app so when you go in the SPE app you go to resources and then you'll see the stay strong series and some of them are there's some soft skill oriented ones but also to Aaron Burton has got a series of videos on there on hydraulic fracturing I believe and it's one way to do this is one of the things I want to watch he actually took one of his courses that he normally teaches it and created these five little minute series that are within the space stay strong portion of the app so that has been fantastic and a little teaser for that too his attire and his background setting are phenomenal for what for our current situation so that's just a little teaser just to let everyone know it's more than just getting great information he has some good fun with it too if it incorporates a body of water I think I know what you're talking about it may and then finally there's the e-mentoring program we're at a time we're in our homes and we're especially if we're stuck in our homes with small children we're really craving some adult conversation that's one way you can get through the e-mentoring and actually dedicated my February column and actually have a whole podcast to on the mentoring so I won't go into that too too much detail but that that's just some of the many things we've been able to roll out in a short period of time that not only had we hoped would be utilized for our members but the data speaks for itself it has been well embraced and it's something I've been very proud of thank you so much for sharing all those Shauna just for everyone listening we will include in the show notes links to all the resources that Shauna just mentioned let's take a quick break we'll be right back with more from 2020 SPE president Shauna Noonan in just a moment SPE is proud to co-sponsor the energy and data webinar series engage and connect with Siddharth Mishra on May 28th at 8 a.m. Central Time gain insights on the use of machine learning techniques through a presentation of case studies don't miss out on this great learning experience register online now the energy and data webinars are powered by a APG SEG and SPE welcome back you're listening to the SPE podcast I'm Jason Notorious speaking with Shauna Noonan we're discussing her May president column titled SPE staying strong since the shortened board meeting in March Shauna what has the board been doing to ensure that SPE survives financially while still being able to provide programs and resources to its members well historically the board only met three times a year that was March June and then just prior to the APC and then over the years you know we've been able to add a few teleconferences in but pretty much there's been a time segment in between when board members will get together but I will tell you that since our truncated board meeting of Buenos Aires early March we've been actually meeting virtually almost every week because the situation has been so fluid and in order to respond with everything changing we've had to do these calls pretty much weekly and I'm so appreciative of our board members for doing this because right now our demand for our time in our own jobs is high right now because all of our companies are suffering and so for them to be able to allocate not only the time to attend the meetings but again to be ensuring that we are making the right decisions it's I'm very very proud to be serving on the board with these people. Now in my article I talked about how are we going to respond not only to short term but really starting to think long term what is our society and our events going to look like and you know one of the things we've had to be really quick in responding to was either the cancellation the postponement of the events as well as starting to flip that virtual switch and as of a week ago we do have some events that the program committees have agreed to go virtual let's see we've got one conference in Asia Pacific one in Dubai we've got three in Europe two in the US three in Canada that are now scheduled to be virtual events and there could actually be hybrid where it's a combination of in person as well as virtual and this is actually something I'm dedicated my July column to is given a little bit more background and understanding as to the virtual event experience because that's something unfamiliar to many of us especially those of my generation because I feel like I have to have that face-to-face interaction and so how can we still not only deliver the content that's something that's relatively easy to do but you know we have all these award ceremonies and networking events and other places for engagement how can we capture that and deliver on it in in a virtual space people outside oil and gas industry they've been doing this for quite a while and we've been spending a lot of time looking at the the goods the bads and the ugly of some of these virtual events and finding ways how we can adapt it you know we have to look at our exhibitors you know what is a virtual exhibit hall experience like other than being able to just say okay we're gonna offer in person figure out how to do the in person within social distancing as well as being able to do virtual what I really want us also to be known for outside of technical excellence is that we're gonna have the reputation to provide the highest confidence of safety for anybody that was to come to an FPE event not only the distancing but sanitization whether a person themselves is picking as to what is which event whether it's an FPE event or a Doug event or even employers looking at which would probably which would be the safest place they could be sending their own people while still getting that high quality content I want FPE to be stand out front and center over and above anybody else in one of the ways this really works is because it is a very strong coming together of many spokes of the SPE wheel turning honestly in harmony because it needs to for this quick turnaround that that's happening to be efficient and sufficient so you really have to appreciate not only the staff but the members and the volunteers and the executives many of whom are going through a difficult time right now so for them to also still want to see SPE survive and succeed in the way that that coordinates with the mission the vision is so admirable I think when I hear these stories of of the time and effort that people are putting in even on a volunteer level knowing that long term we're doing this for the industry yes and ultimately it's our survival to depend on the survival of our industry and so that was how my final point in my column was how much of the industry learned and adapted from the last downturn I had made reference to Deloitte study in my column but there is there's so much more information that is just starting to be made public whether it's a YouTube for example just prior to recording this podcast I was listening to a Baker Institute podcast with Andrew Gould and Bobby Tudor on the future of oilfield services and highly recommend that one it was gives a very good historical perspective on the various business models and then kind of what what the outlook they think is going to be for the service sector and also know from the operating company side you know there was a lot of cost efficiencies that were achieved from the last downturn that allowed us only us because I work for an operating company to be able to react quicker but also to we have a lot stronger digital and data platform so we now had the data almost right in front of us and to be able to throw some AI at it to quickly determine which wells we need to shut in in that making the right decisions you know economically which are the right wells to be shutting in and then of course to flip that once the markets start to correct themselves as they're starting to do now that we're then bringing the right wells back on for example and this is where you know I again FBE itself has been positioned you know apart a huge part of our strategic plan was all about the digital transformation of SBE and because we had stayed focused and we're implementing that it's also allowing us to not only react but to be a lot more effective to ride this extremely rough patch and so the way I ended my column the way I want to end today is with continued ingenuity innovation and collaboration in all sectors of our industry we will prevail yet again you know the main difference you know I tried to be a bit light-hearted on this because this is this is my environment when I was writing this column is that you know this time we are going to be doing it virtually from one another with some of us still in our pajamas the message I want to send out to our members again is you know we've been staying safe we've been seeing the positive shift in the curve but we need to continue to stay safe and stay strong not only for one another but for ourselves again you know a healthy member is is a happy member is a beneficial society so thank you so much Shana question of the month is next but first a reminder about a new digital venture called SPE live simulcast across SPE social media

SPE Live Podcast: Technical Director Series ‚Äì CCS/CCUS Opportunities and Challenges for Safe Storage and Decarbonization Efforts,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live Gaia Talk, Real Decarbonization, Seizing the Low Carbon Future. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on April 10th, 2023. And now your moderator, Deb Ryan. Welcome to this SPE Live Gaia Talk on Real Decarbonization, Seizing the Low Carbon Future. My name is Deb Ryan. I'm on the SPE Board of Directors as one of the North American Regional Directors. And I'm also head of Low Carbon Commodities at S&P Global Commodity Insights. And I'll be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last about 30 minutes and we encourage you to ask questions during the program. It is now my absolute pleasure to introduce our guest today. Tisha Shuler founded Adamine Energy to provide thought leadership to energy companies to translate sustainability and decarbonization aspirations into action. Tisha advises private clients from Fortune 100 energy companies to nonprofit environmental organizations in matters including ESG and decarbonization strategies, managing disruption, energy policy, environmental justice and stakeholder management. She has a bachelor's of science from Stanford University and serves as a strategic advisor for Stanford University's natural gas initiative. Tisha serves on many academic and nonprofit boards, including those of the Breakthrough Institute, the Energy for Growth Hub, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science Institute for Science and Policy, Strategic Council, the University of Wisconsin-Madison-Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Paine Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines here in Denver. And she is a member of the National Petroleum Council, an advisory board to the US Secretary of Energy under the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. Tisha, welcome to SV Live today. So glad to be here with you, Deb. Thanks for having me. No, it's absolutely wonderful. Tisha, you publish your most recent book, Real Decarbonization, and you know, how oil and gas companies are seizing the low carbon future. It came out last fall. I highly recommend everybody in the oil and gas reads this. I have, it's fabulous. And I'm very excited to talk to you about it today. The obvious question today is what does real decarbonization mean to you and why does it matter? Yeah, so real decarbonization has two meanings. And before I jump into that, I just want to thank you, Deb, for having me. And thanks so much to the awesome team at SPE. Natalie, Johanna, Asha, my colleagues, Lindsay and Savannah also helped prep this. Like so much magic happens for this very efficient use of the audience's half hour. So super psyched to be here. And the two meanings of real decarbonization are essentially come from the notion that there's a lot of myth and misinformation about decarbonization out there. And so the first meaning is that real decarbonization only happens for the energy system globally and at scale with oil and gas, not only intricately involved, but I believe at the helm. And I'm sure we'll talk about that today. And then the second meaning of real decarbonization is the emphasis on real. That a lot of companies have made net zero aspirations, but we have to translate that to action as companies to be considered credible partners and ultimately, I think, credible civic leaders in real decarbonization. So we're going to have to translate those aspirations into actions through 10 year plans. And that's going to have to have substantial investment reorganization, culture change. And I'm sure those are all things we'll talk about today. No, they're definitely topics that I think are so important for members, you know, operationalizing energy transition and decarbonization is key. You know, we're a society of engineers and scientists. And so we're definitely going to jump into some of these things today. And so for our audience that's listening, where do they start? You know, what a company is doing on this journey and what are some of those first steps? So there's a really important step when companies decide to embrace real decarbonization, which is to take stock of the current state of affairs within the company, because everything that's going to happen is going to be built off the foundation of what exists today. So it's going to be important for companies to identify their drivers each, whether you're an upstream EMP focused on natural gas or you're a midstream oil only pipeline company, for example, to a gas utility. The drivers are going to be completely different. And when we look at drivers, we're talking about risks, opportunities and pressures. So companies are going to need to look at that first, and then they're going to need to articulate their objectives. What do they want to get out of this? Are they reimagining their company for the next 100 years? Or are they really thinking about getting three years ahead of investor and maybe community pressures? So taking stock and then identifying objectives are the first steps. And then more or less, every company is going to fall into one of four trajectories. And those range from we're going to remain doing our core business, but we're going to do it at the lowest cost as possible. This is like we're going to stay in business and we're going to be the last company doing what we do for the lowest cost all the way to the fourth trajectory, which is we're going to reinvent ourselves as an energy company of the future. So once companies have taken stock, identified their drivers, set their objectives, and they're going to pick a trajectory, then that trajectory guides the investments and decisions that happen from there on out. I think that's really cool. And as you talked about how the companies are taking stock of all the different things that they're looking at, you talked about risk, opportunities and pressures. So I want to dive into this. One of the things I really loved in the book is as you've interviewed leaders as part of this, a lot of them talked about the opportunity in the decarbonized piece. Can you talk a little bit about why you think that is? Why do you think leaders are reframing this as an opportunity? Yeah, there's a couple of reasons. One, CEOs are, I did not know this before I embarked upon this journey, but CEOs are overwhelmingly optimistic people. So there isn't a CEO who is a curmudgeon out there that I've had the chance to work with. And so when they see a challenge, the first thing they want to do is figure out is there an opportunity here in this? And because the most overwhelming, consistent theme of our world today is volatility, things are changing geopolitically, commodity prices, weather, whatever it is that affects your business, consumer preferences, technology evolution. The one thing you can count on is volatility. So if you already take for granted the idea that the only option that is not on the table is to do nothing, what you're really setting the table for is a mindset of, well, then what are the opportunities? And then the range really comes down to whether leaders are thinking about a short term opportunity or someone like Chad Zamarin at Williams, who says our company's been here for 100 years, and we're looking for what the next 100 years is going to look like. So the variation around opportunity is really on horizon and time frame. And I thought that was so inspiring and really informed a lot of the book from there. Once you know you have these optimistic leaders looking for opportunity, that really changes everything. I really love how you reframe just the mindset of how the leaders of our companies are actually looking at a lot of these things. And you sort of alluded to it, but you interviewed a lot of CEOs and senior leaders as part of the book. And a lot of them accordion in the book as well, which is fabulous. And so you asked a lot of these leaders about what's driving them to prioritize their energy transition. Are there any specific and common themes that you saw through all these interviews in this journey? Yeah, I think there's a couple. One is that there are a myriad of pressures around decarbonization. And as I argue in all of my work from the book to my weekly interviews on the podcast, I really think these pressures are directional. So although politics, the pendulum will swing back and forth in politics, and we'll have some maybe more extreme expectations around prioritizing climate, for example, over energy security. And then the pendulum might swing back. What we're seeing are some directional changes around generational expectations around what they want from their energy system and what they want from corporations. And then also just a prioritization of climate around the world and really across sectors. So all of this means that if you're an oil and gas CEO, even five years ago, you could work in a company and not ever say the word climate. But that simply isn't an option today. Whether you're privately held or you're facing this upcoming proxy season's stakeholder resolutions, every CEO has to be fluent in how to talk about energy transitions and the role of the oil and gas industry and the energy future. So I found it, I think, most striking how thoroughly engaged CEOs were, but also how companies that aren't explicitly embarking on their decarbonization journey are actually behind. And I didn't expect that. I expected there to be more of, okay, everybody's got 10 years to get their act together. I would say, no, everybody's got 20, 23 to get their act together. And then we really all need to have a credible story to articulate how we are both participating and meeting the energy requirements of today and participating in creating a scalable decarbonizing energy future as the civic leaders we are. I really love how you dived into as well, sort of what surprised you in this. I found as well in the last kind of 18 months, two years, as I've been working in this space as well, the conversation does seem to change. Like you've emphasized in the book you talked about today, that directional change. It felt like last year there seemed like there was going to be a conversation around the pendulum swing and was it going to come back? But you're kind of indicating that that pendulum swing, maybe it's not, it's more directional. And I don't know if you wanted to add anything else on that. Yeah, I'd love to talk a little bit more about that. There's a couple, I mean, there's like 5,000 things I'd like to talk about, but I'll try to pick one. So I do think that when Russia invaded Ukraine, we really saw how people's expectation for the energy future inform how they interpret events. So there was almost immediately a split screen. If you believe that the energy transition was maybe overblown or untethered from reality, both of which it can be. But if you felt that, then you said, okay, good. Now the world is going to prioritize energy security, energy affordability, reliability. On the other hand, if you think that we should have been off fossil fuels yesterday, then you interpreted what happened in that invasion as we're going to accelerate the transition off of fossil fuels. Now, interestingly, both of these things are true, which is a core tenant of my work. And the reason two things can be true at the same time is because the world is complicated and good people can interpret the same events differently based on what their expectations are. What does that mean for us? That means that we have to be mindful of the fact that two things can be, two seemingly opposing ideas can be true at the same time and therefore be more nuanced, more sophisticated in the way we engage. The couple of ways that we can do that as energy leaders, one, shared aspirations, identifying the end goals that we can all share. I think it's pretty much universally accepted that we want affordable, reliable, ever cleaner energy. If we identify those shared aspirations, then we can then figure out how to work together toward those ends. And I think that that's what 2022 really taught me was that even in a moment of global reckoning around energy and around climate, it didn't really change the polarized nature of the conversation. What it did was give us an opportunity, probably the opportunity of our lifetimes to start new conversations about the really important role oil and gas companies can play in the energy future. I really love that you talked about that reframing last year. I think it was, there was some really interesting points throughout the year last year when you could really tell the directional change. And I think that's going to be something that we continue to see. In your second book that you published back in, was it 2020? The Game Changers Playbook, How Oil and Gas Leaders Thrive in an Era of Continuous Disruption. Oh, my COVID puppy. I have got, and I have read that book as well, and I highly recommend it too. But you talk about, and you just talked about this in your response, this wide narrative and wide range of different viewpoints that we see across the whole energy conversation spectrum. And you know, how do you embrace that polarization and how do you address those different viewpoints? You sort of alluded to it a little bit, but I'd love you to expand on that. Yeah. I mean, one of the most important things I think as people who work in the oil and gas industry is to simply accept the fact that there's a lot of things we need to accept, but a couple would be one, there's a lot of people who have negative perceptions about us as an energy industry. And often we don't get fair treatment, maybe in the media or academia. So what? Let's lead anyway. That becomes sometimes an excuse for being reactionary or defensive or, I mean, not creative about how we lead. I actually think we can embrace the fact that the world's polarized. People have really big expectations of their energy, that it like be always there, always affordable, expand around the world and be totally decarbonized yesterday. And people have those expectations and our opportunity out of that is to create leadership and say, we too share your concerns about the future of energy in the world. And we have the workforce, the dollars, the R&D, the investment, the infrastructure to lead in decarbonizing the energy system around the world. And that's what I want us to walk into is not taking those excuses of like, we're mistreated, people don't understand, if only they knew how important we were. Let's set all that aside. It's a waste of energy and it's a waste of time. And instead think about the solutions that we're going to offer and the bridges that we're going to build as an industry. I think the thing that you said earlier that ties back to that is those shared aspirations. It's not, you know, what do we know that getting rid of that us versus them and really finding those commonalities to diffuse some of those conversations is really key. We've started getting some questions coming in from the audience, but before we go to those, I want to sort of shift the focus a little bit to that operationalizing, you know, and operate, you know, there's a lot of strategies out there. Companies are putting out their net zero strategies thick and fast. You know, SPE as I mentioned at the beginning, we are engineers, we are scientists, you know, people on the ground doing the operational work. And that's been very much around, you know, SPE's GAIA program has been how do we have these conversations? How do we start to operationalize that energy transition? You know, what do you think is going to be key for companies to actually move from talking and into that operational action? Yeah, there's a number of things. One will be that every employee at companies has an opportunity today. Another recurring theme I heard from CEOs is there are more ideas and opportunities than there are people to meet them. And so in organizations, and even though our oil and gas companies tend to be hierarchical, very traditional, perhaps mildly stifling to Gen Z, you know, and up until recently millennial employees. And yet, if you decide to become a student, both of your companies decarbonize, decarbonizing efforts, and what's happening out in the world, the expectations around oil and gas adjacent technologies. These are things like geothermal, hydrogen, RNG. There's so many ways that our industry is going to be central to decarbonizing within the next five years, especially with all this IRA money coming out, for example, in the US. So every employee has the opportunity to become a student of both their company and what's happening out in the energy landscape and look for opportunities to make suggestions and engage. Because ultimately, when companies do this, it's going to be fully aligned with their strategy. It's going to be core to their investments and innovation. And so ultimately, companies are reinventing themselves, it may happen on a three to five year timeframe to make sure that they are going to be the leading companies of tomorrow, whether it's in the lowest carbon molecule within their space, you know, the lowest carbon intensity, for example, natural gas to be exported to Europe, or maybe a company that is going to pair CCS with their oil production operations. And there's going to be many solutions and there's really going to be infinite opportunities for employees who are paying attention to offer suggestions and get involved. Very cool. So I'm going to pull some of the questions we've had. And the first one actually came from Angie Lorena Garcia-Arrizas. So thank you so much for putting this in. And so we've been talking a lot about company decarbonization. And she asked about the role of countries. Specifically, she asked about how low carbon countries can help. But I'm actually going to flip that as well. How does that look for high carbon countries as well helping countries that maybe don't have a lot of energy or don't have a lot of footprint? So like I said, yeah, like what's that country perspective? Yes, I have so I have super strong feelings about this, which I welcome audience feedback and participation on. But I sit the board for Energy for Growth Hub, which is focused on bringing energy at scale to developing economies because no economy develops without high energy and high energy intensity. And although there will be some ability to leapfrog the highest intensity, carbon intensity fuels, there's not going to be an ability to leapfrog industrialization. So I think actually it is a burden incumbent upon all of us and developed economies to ensure first and foremost, the developing economies modernize and have the opportunity to raise people out of poverty and to have a vibrant workforce, which includes some form of industrialization and service sector. So I feel very strongly about that. And then can we do that and be decarbonizing? Yes, but it's not going to be zero carbon because we can't build an economy on things that don't yet exist at scale that we're not even putting them into practice in developed countries. So I think there's going to be a dance and one of I think the world's greatest opportunities and solutions will be natural gas at scale and developing economies. This will allow countries to move from coal to natural gas in the electricity sector to have feedstock for industrialization, chemicals, fertilizers. And so I'm very bullish on a transition that is just in the truest sense, just in the sense that we don't leave countries behind and that developed economies take on the burden of decarbonizing first and lowering the cost of those things. And I absolutely am opposed to any kind of ban on fuels in developing economies because we just can't put constraints on other countries that we're not willing to put on ourselves. I just think that's the ultimate hypocrisy. No, I appreciate that. And I think it is like you said at the beginning, it is going to be on all of us to do it. And we got another question in from LinkedIn from Andreas Michael, and it sort of ties into this quite well. He was asking about the directional changes, but essentially how much of it's government and regulatory driven versus like the market driven, you know, and that balance. Yeah. So I speak as a very confused liberal, libertarian mindset. So what I can tell you is the observations that we monitor data wise at my firm are focused on the public. So the electorate on employees and on the way public opinion is changing. So for example, just in the United States alone from 2008 to now, every state has a significantly higher percentage of people who are concerned about climate change. A second like directional change we see is millennials will dominate the population through 2050. Millennials are of course more concerned about climate than prior generations. And millennials are also more willing to prioritize getting off of fossil fuels. So these are things we have to pay attention to because millennials, for example, as a generation that is changing the face of business and politics are now in their early 40s. So they are our policymakers, our elected officials, our investors. And so these directional changes, I think, are the things that won't go back and are actually influencing policy and politics. Now, my personal feeling is a lot of energy and climate policy has gone too far in the sense that decarbonization is prioritized at the expense of the very many tradeoffs that we have to consider cost, reliability, global insecurity. But I think it is a reflection of the generational change that we see in consumers and in the electorate. So I don't expect those things to change. I do think that for a year or two, we have a real moment to inject conversations about tradeoffs and about having an orderly, a thoughtful, a transition that brings all the countries along. I think there's a window now where we can have these sensible conversations with people that might not have been open to them a couple of years ago. I definitely think we're starting to see that. And it sort of goes back to that pendulum swing versus the directional change conversation. Do we have it all right? No. But is it moving in that direction? Yeah. I think I completely agree with that. So you started talking about some of the young professionals, the millennials, the Gen Zs. I definitely put myself in that category. Just, just, but that's okay. SPE, we have a huge number of young professionals and students that make up our global membership. And as engineers and scientists, we're taught to solve problems at the core as an engineer, even though that's what we do. And so as the next generation of leaders, what are some of the things that our SPE students and young professionals can do to really maximize their impact in this changing business, changing energy space? Yes. We're so lucky as an industry to have all, we still have all the generations represented. We have greatest generation that brought us where we are today. We have the boomers that are still running most of our companies and have brought a transformation of prosperity to the world around us. And now, and then of course, my generation, Gen X, everyone loves to forget about us, but you know, at this point, we're the empowers of the millennials who are coming along. So the millennials are in their forties and then Gen Z is my kids' generation all the way through the, our, the youngest workforce that we have in oil and gas. So here's what we, what I learned from interviewing leaders about how they're thinking about real decarbonization. There's of course, always going to be a need for science and engineering. As you said, solving the world's greatest problems are, is exactly what we're here to do. Like what greater engineering challenge do we have than decarbonizing the energy system? And the emphasis will be pairing that with these softer skills, curiosity, empathy, political savvy. So this was one of the other really cool things I didn't expect that I learned from my interviews, but over and over companies would say the hardest part now of getting a project built is getting the permit and community approvals. And that was two years ago. Now with the emphasis on environmental justice and the very important community engagement components that are going to come with, with that, it's going to be even more challenging to engage with communities in an authentic way that you are a welcome guest in these projects. So what does that mean for engineers and scientists? It means that we're going to have to pair our savvy or intellectual savvy with a building these soft skills, empathy, curiosity, political awareness. And that's going to be a gift to the industry because I actually think we've done ourselves a disservice the last 10 years by having like community engagement over here, investor relations over there, engineering here, maybe science over here. This is truly going to be a cross-discipline effort because to engage with the public, we also have to have the opportunity to really bring them along with what we're thinking and planning. So that's going to require our scientists and engineers, but they're also going to have to be quite sensitive and savvy to the way the world has changed and it's not going back. I don't think we're going to build anything that where we're not an invited guest. So that's a totally different paradigm for building a decarbonizing energy future. It's, I would agree. It's a huge shift of how we bring all these groups together where historically everyone's been very siloed in those organizations and everyone needs to be fluent across all these different aspects as well. And millennials and Gen Z love that. They do not want to be left in a cube with a computer. So the great thing is that this generational change is very timely and not coincidental because our audience is also the millennials and Gen Zs. Yeah. And building on that a little bit, how do you, you know, for all the young professionals and students and even, you know, myself and everyone else that's listening today, like, you know, how do you think emerging leaders within organizations can set themselves up for success in this new environment? Yeah. The one of the most important, I guess I'm quoting Chad Zemmer and twice, but he had quite an impact on me. So he's with Williams. He said, there's so many footballs on the field, pick one up and start running. You might get tackled, but you might not. And I actually thought that was such a great metaphor. Now, how does that translate to you in your day to day? It means pay attention, listen to the podcasts around the energy transition, study what's going on in the environmental NGOs, listen to what's happening in places that make us uncomfortable, whether very conservative or very liberal around ESG, around decarbonization, the more insightful you can be while not getting hooked into the political drama around these things, the more you're going to have to offer to your company when there's opportunity to do, you know, shark tanks around innovation or engaging on public campaigns to, to work within a community and figure out what, what they're going to want. So the more you can be mindful of this broad spectrum of, of political position and the really, really many cool things happening around the energy transition, the more powerfully capable you will be about being an ambassador, both for your company and for the industry. And so it really is like, there's, there's no greater time that you could bring your own curiosity and skillset into your company to say, Hey, I think we could do things differently. And then I'll be on the other end, pushing on the boards and executive teams saying, you've got to bring millennials and Gen Z into your most important planning tables. And so you, when those moments happen, you got to be ready. No, I, Tisha, I love that. And I feel like the conversation around energy transition has just in the last 18 months, got just got so much more optimistic and so much more positive. What are you most excited about in terms of the opportunities for, for oil and gas and for our, for our industry? The thing that, I mean, I am so blessed because I do, I'm doing the work I was born to do. And it's like a super weird thing to get born to do. Like I'm going to work on decarbonization for the oil and gas industry. And 10 years ago, I was probably too far thinking too radically for where we were as an industry. The thing I'm optimistic about today is that I have to update and our firm has to update our thinking so quickly to stay in front of the progress of the oil and gas industry. We are going to be producing the lowest carbon molecules. We're going to be delivering them around the world. I am so excited that company leadership is transcending and ignoring a lot of this political polarization, because it's just doesn't serve any of us. And the less we identify with one side or the other, the more we identify with problem, leadership, let's bring solutions, the more we're going to have opportunities for ourselves and accelerate decarbonization. So I couldn't be more excited about what's going to come in the months ahead. Well, Tisha, we're, we've reached time. Unfortunately, I want to thank everyone for putting the questions in. I know we didn't get to all of them. We could probably talk for another 30 minutes on this topic. It's been absolutely fabulous. And thank you so much for joining us and sharing your insights today. I recommend everybody goes out and gets the book. It's really good. It's not so long, so it won't take you that long to read. Congrats, Tisha. And again, thank you so much for joining us. We'll see you next time. Thanks to SPE. Thanks to Devin. Thanks for those of you out there who are accelerating decarbonization by working in the oil and gas industry. It's an honor to get to work with you. Thanks. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast. For more content, visit the SPE Energy Stream, the industry's digital pulse at streaming.spe.org.

SPE Live Podcast: Geothermal Vision for the Oil and Gas Industry and Why It Is Critical,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live pre ATCE series, Enabling Startups and Innovative Entrepreneurs in Oil and Gas. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on May 8th, 2023. And now your moderator, Naeem Childhury. Welcome to this SPE Live on Enabling Startups and Innovative Entrepreneurs in Oil and Gas. My name is Naeem Childhury. I am the head of CCUS at Project Canary, leading efforts to enhance sustainability and reduce carbon emissions to data driven solutions. And I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE will last approximately 30 minutes. We encourage you, the viewers, to ask questions during the program. Before starting our conversation, I would like to invite you to attend the SPE annual technical conference and exhibition, also known as ATCE, and the Startup Village, which we will be talking about today, being held this year on the 16th through the 18th of October in San Antonio, Texas. As I mentioned, our topic of conversation today is enabling startups and innovative entrepreneurs in oil and gas. The oil and gas industry has been a major contributor to the global economy for decades. And despite the current push for renewable energy, it remains a vital part of our energy mix. However, with increasing concerns about the environment and the need for sustainable energy solutions, many startups are emerging in the sector with innovative ideas, technologies that are challenging traditional ways of doing things. These startups are disrupting the status quo and driving innovation in the industry. In today's conversation, I would like to explore challenges, opportunities and avenues for all parties involved in this ecosystem. Let me start by introducing our panelists. Bryant Mueller is the area director of sales at Aspen Technology based in Houston, Texas. Bryant has spent his entire career developing, marketing, selling and deploying digital solutions in the energy industry. He has been an SPE volunteer for more than 25 years and has held various leadership positions, including serving on the International Board of Directors. He is currently the chairman of the SPE Startup Village, an event he helped co-found in 2017. He holds a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Tulsa. Our next guest is Aaron Lazarus, chief scientist at Pioneer Natural Resources, whose responsibilities fall at the intersection of ESG and emerging technologies. Prior to Pioneer, he worked as a program manager at DARPA and received his Bachelor of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from the Webb Institute and his Masters of Science and Doctorate in Civil Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Next, we have Ian Dickinson, president and CEO at Long Path Technologies. Ian brings over 20 years of executive leadership experience, including serving as CEO for both private and public companies in the energy industry over the past eight years. Prior to that, Ian held various senior leadership roles across a diverse set of industries and companies ranging from Fortune 500 firms to smaller venture capital-backed businesses. Bryant, Aaron and Ian, welcome to this SPE Live. I'm going to go ahead and kick this off and start with an introduction question for Ian. Ian, you've been, as we heard, in the startup industry for a little while and you have had a multitude of experiences on the topic. Could you please describe in your words, what do you think are some of the challenges faced by startups specifically in the oil and gas industry? Yeah, well, I want to start by saying thanks to SPE for this opportunity to participate and the other panelists. Great to be here with you today. I might say the biggest challenge is keeping a full head of hair, but I think there's more to it than that. Look, I mean, startups in any industry are challenging. You know, oil and gas has its specific challenges, but you know, you've got the process of fundraising. You're implementing innovation, which equals organizational change. And you're building a market at the same time you're building a company and an organization. So that's true across any startup in any industry. And but specific to oil and gas, I think you've got to keep in mind that it's not just a technology, if that's your innovation. It's really a solution. And so you've got to work very closely across what is a very complex environment in oil and gas. There are long development timelines. You need to be aware of that. You're implementing this change into, again, a very complex environment. There are many stakeholders from the executive team to the technical teams. You're often working with the HSE, the health and safety teams, and then ultimately operations that are on the ground. So it can be a very complex environment to ensure that you're meeting the needs of all stakeholders. And then every oil and gas company is different. I mean, they're they're different in size or different in the way that they make decisions and they're different in geography. And so you have to be quite nimble to ensure that whatever your innovation is fits that specific organization's needs. It can be capital intensive. Oftentimes, you're working in areas that require you to have resources that can get to areas that are not heavily populated. And it's critical that you find and retain talent. And that's true with any company, certainly true with startups. You tend to have small teams. You need folks that are talented and willing to work really hard. So those are a few thoughts on startups and energy. Yeah, that's a great, great few points there, Ian. Just to connect with you mentioned the integration of the startup methodology and potentially large, oil and gas companies. We have Aaron as one of our panelists. Aaron, I'd love to ask you as an entrepreneur, how do you get your technology in front of oil and gas companies? That's a great question, Naim. Obviously, thank you, Desby, for the invitation to this panel. Obviously, it's great to be on the panel with Ian and Brian. I think the first thing that entrepreneurs have going for them is that in this day and age, companies are pushing to be innovative. So they're actually scouting and looking for new technology. So that's a big advantage. They're looking to find companies. When you look at the ways big companies go to find smaller companies or ways to be more innovative, there's sort of three approaches to finding those companies. The first approach is obviously intelligence or scouting services. So using a company that helps and brings startup companies to you. Great example of that is Darcy Partners, where you can attend their meetings and they catalog and organize and come up with lists of companies that larger companies can look at and find ways to be innovative. A lot of companies have a venture program where they can be LPs in a fund or affiliated with a fund. And most of those relationships give them access to the venture companies or the venture partners deal flow. And you can see all the companies that they're looking at and all the different ways and all the different technologies that are out there. And then the final way is obviously meeting and networking, which is obviously the most important. And there are tons of meetings that you can go to to meet new companies and entrepreneurs. Obviously, the government meetings like RPE, where entrepreneurs that are being funded by the government, you can go see the technologies they're developing. There's nonprofit organizations like the Rightless Alliance that hold meetings like their venture forum where you can meet new companies in the oil and gas space. And obviously, one of the most important ones is ATCE and in particular the Startup Village program, where you can get exposed to and see new companies that are revolutionizing or coming up with revolutionary technologies in the oil and gas space and changing the way we explore and operate. That's great. And I'm glad you brought up the SBE Startup Village. Actually, would love to talk about that for a second. Bryant, could you explain or can you with your experience and your position at the ATCE Startup Village, could you give us and our audiences an idea of what is the SBE Startup Village and what's the incentive, where did it start and what's the whole purpose of having this startup competition sponsored by SBE with an oil and gas? Yeah, Neem, thank you very much for the question. And again, thank you to our my fellow panelists for their time volunteering here today. I think to answer your question, it's probably best to start with, well, what is SBE trying to do? You know, the SBE mission is to connect energy professionals to exchange knowledge and to innovate. And the vision of SBE is to advance our industry's ability to meet the world's energy needs in a safe, secure and sustainable manner. And so when you look at all of the programs that SBE puts on to connect our professionals to advance technology, to disseminate technology, several years ago, we were having a brainstorm about, well, what is, is there anything we're missing? And we realized that SBE had traditionally catered more towards the established companies. So the idea came, let's make sure SBE is encouraging entrepreneurs and startups. And so we created the Startup Village back in 2017, held it in person for three years until COVID hit. So this year we're back in person in San Antonio for the first time in about three years. And really this competition is designed to showcase some of the bright sparks in our industry by bringing together, you know, like 10 startups in a shark tank style competition. They sit in front of a panel of judges, of industry leaders, and kind of have a little friendly competition to say, look, which one's best in show and what are our rising stars? And these companies are obviously gaining industry exposure to our industry as a whole, to some of the leaders in the room, people online. But also, you know, the winner gets to put the Society of Patrol and Engineers logo next to their name as a champion, like Ian and Longpath. And then we also throw in some cash prizes to make it interesting. But it's an exciting event that's been going on for several years now. And we've seen proven success of helping some of these entrepreneurs and startups get off the ground and really raise their exposure in the industry. Ian, this is this SP Startup Village is sounds like a fantastic place for startups to jump in. My question is, you mentioned sometime in October is where during ATCE we would have the actual competition. Are there other timelines that we should be concerned about? When can, when should startups start thinking about applying and how does that timeline work? Yeah, so good, good question, Naim. It's important for all the startups out there to know that our application is going to open up on May 12th. So that's just around the corner. We will close those applications July 14th. So we're asking all startups and entrepreneurs out there to to go to the Startup Village website and apply to be in the competition. We will be selecting the competitors towards the middle of August. One of the really cool things about this event is we have a coaching session with the competitors in the middle of September, where industry leaders meet with you as a startup and walk through your pitch and give you some pointers on what resonates with the judging panel and how to win the competition. And then our our event is October 17th on a Tuesday in San Antonio at the Convention Center there. So we're excited to see everyone there. So please, when the applications open on May 12th, apply and we hope to see you there at the competition. Thanks, Brian. You talked about Ian and Longpath. I wanted to bring in back in and ask Ian, what was your experience like in at the Startup Village? Can you tell us from us and the audience a perspective from a unique technology startup? How what was the the Startup Village experience and how did that help you? Yeah, so it was a great experience. I mean, I think the opportunity to hone your message and be able to present that in front of not only potential customers, but potential fundraising partners is a it's an enormous opportunity. So it allows organizations like ourselves that at the very early days where you've got limited access to capital resources and even in some cases, network, it allows you that opportunity to get your message in front of a large audience. The ability to present in a fun way, in a competition, in front of a panel of experts and then receive some feedback and and then watch the other folks presenting. It really helps you kind of get a sense for what kind of questions are the industry asking? You know, how do I get my message in front of the right folks and how do I refine that? So it was easy. It was fun. And I just highly recommend it. I think some of the points that Aaron made in his comments are absolutely critical. You've got to find ways to network. And really, I haven't found a better way to get our message out than through ACT. It seemed to reach a very large and relevant audience. So I was taking it a little bit more general on that topic. Maybe for Aaron, Aaron, we're talking about a startup competition. We understand now that this is a stage for startups and startup technologies that can that that can offer technologies into the oil and gas industry. And it's an avenue for them to get the word out, maybe even win some cash prizes. But on the topic of cash prizes, which we understand financing is so important for startups to get a foothold. You mentioned earlier kind of the ways in which you can get in front of oil and gas companies. Can you describe your thoughts on what are the different funding options available for startups in general? Other than presenting and winning startup competitions or getting cash from startup competitions. So, I mean, the ecosystem for funding, especially depending on the stage, obviously, there's depending on what the topic is, there's access to government funding. So obviously, RPE and DOE have had a number of topics. There's obviously a fossil fuels office, a DOE and then RPE, especially if it's an HG related topic, has funded a number of programs to improve the environmental performance of oil and gas scenario. An example, that would be the monitor program that was focused on advanced methane detection systems. Think Long Path is actually a company that came out of that that program, which was incredibly successful. But without a doubt, the primary source or at least for initial funding is obviously venture firms. And there are a large number of venture firms that focus on oil and gas technology, pioneers and LP and many of those. And that's a great way because one of the benefits of working with a venture firm that's focused on oil and gas technology is they have relationships, networks with large oil and gas companies. And not only can they provide you funding, but they can get you in front of oil and gas companies and can help you refine your message and the value proposition that you provide. So that's a great way. And then obviously, there's a little bit of prize money from ATC, Startup Village. And I'm not sure that's going to cover an entire funding round, but that's another way to get started and help build out your reputation. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that, Aaron. So we were getting a slew of questions from the from the audience. Great to see some good audience engagement through all our different avenues where this is being broadcast. But before we get there, I wanted to ask a question to the committee, to the entire panelists, to all the panelist that we have. And just in your opinion, and I'd love to go one to all of you, how important is or how important are startups to promote innovation in oil and gas? I'd love to start with you, Ian. Yeah, well, I think startups are critical. It's an opportunity to bring new thinking to the table. Oftentimes, startups come not rooted in the industry that they have application and so can bring different ideas and different ways of tackling challenges. So, you know, it's really a critical piece of an overall healthy ecosystem in any industry. You know, if I were to add to Ian's comment, it's also for for large companies, it's an opportunity to get access to technology that we might not have internal expertise for. So a great example to bring back to Longpath is there's some incredibly unique and very innovative laser technology that's the basis for the Longpath system. A large company might not have that expertise. So being able to partner with a startup not only gets you access to the technology, but gets you access to understanding the space. So, you know, like I said, if you if you work with these smaller companies, I mean, one part of it is great if you can get build a business relationship from it. But even if you don't necessarily build a business relationship from it, you can learn a lot through through the interactions and then even through a potential trial, even if there isn't an ultimate commercial venture that happens from it. Yeah, Naima, I'll add in there to working for a technology company. One, it's always good to have competition and startups bring a different type of competition than what you're used to. So it makes technology companies stay nimble. But all technology companies like mine, we're on a steady path of growth and innovation. We grow organically, but also sometimes we grow in organically. Sometimes our best investment is to encourage young, unfettered companies to push the boundaries and see what's possible in industry. And then maybe instead of doing something on our own, we go acquire that company. And a lot of startups, that's their their path is when can I exit? So for a technology company like mine, it's very important to have a constant steady stream of entrepreneurs and innovators out there, either to challenge us or to become a part of our company eventually. Great, great. Thank you so much for that. I'm going to take a couple of questions from our from our comments section on LinkedIn and the energy stream site as well. Let's start with a question from our energy stream site. This question is from Eric Jay Leach. His question is, from an ESG perspective, what are you seeing are the best opportunities for new startups? I can point that to Aaron to start. Yeah, so I mean, there's a lot of the ESG space, especially the ESG space in oil and gas is obviously growing. Right. You know, there are a wide variety of areas that we're working on. You know, there are a wide variety of areas. I mean, there's a lot of innovation coming out on the remote sensing side. So, you know, we're trying to reduce our global footprint. Obviously, innovative and advanced technologies and remote sensing is having a revolution in the oil and gas space, enhancing our ESG footprint. There's a lot on the carbon accounting and planning side. So now oil and gas companies have made commitments to be net zero. So there's a whole tool set that come with meeting that obligation and planning to meet that obligation. And then on the CCUS, a lot of people, Naeem, I'm sure can chime in about this, but there's a lot of innovation coming around CCUS. What role oil and gas companies can play in that. And so I think to pick one area, I think is a little limiting. I think oil and gas as we move forward, because it's still a crucial part of the energy mix and try and improve our and build upon the success we've had in improving our environmental performance. There are there. There are a lot of areas. I wouldn't necessarily say there's just one. Thanks so much. So I'm glad you brought up CCUS. I do have a background in and currently in the CCUS side. There's a question specifically to CCUS that I'd love to I'd love to talk about as well. This is from Evan D from the SP Energy Stream site. Evan asks, good morning from Alaska. Are you seeing a larger interest in LCEIS, CCUS and DAC technologies? Evan, one thing I can I can tell you being in the trenches with CCUS and then currently working for a CCUS technology company or technology companies developing CCUS products. Yes, there is there's there's a lot of eyes and ears and a lot of dollars going into developing CCUS technologies every day. One thing I will mention is that is on top of requirements and then and really parking ears up as they be talked about is economics. CCUS technologies and DAC or direct air capture technologies that are creating a change for the economics of the entire value chain. Those are conversations that are very hot at the moment. In my opinion, they're getting a lot of attention. Step changing, step changing technologies that's going to allow us to scale up CCUS with with with the lowest lowest economic impact and our lowest economics from a dollar perspective, highest carbon footprint impact are kind of big high level technologies that are being looked at a lot. Thank you so much for that question. I'll take a couple more. This one is actually for you, Bryant, I think. The question is from from also the SP Energy Stream site from Kevin. The question is, does the SBE support startups that didn't make the ATCE cut? For example, is there a web page where they can present themselves so that potential partners can be aware of them? Thanks, Kevin, for the question. The first half of your question of yes, our goal is to support all startups in energy related industries. The startup village itself is focused on every year, choosing a subset to highlight in the competition and to raise awareness there. As we expand this event, though, we are always looking for ways to better our impact in the industry. And your question here is maybe something for our committee to consider how to do this maybe in the future. We don't have a web page now that can do this, but I'm writing a note because it's a good idea. We're grateful to be back in person again for the first time in many years. And so as we check the success in San Antonio and we expand our event, maybe this is an idea that we can take on. So thank you for the question and the recommendation. Absolutely. I haven't been part of the SBE startup village over a few years. I think the best one of the one of the coolest things we can say is show up. Come support your fellow startups. If you haven't made the cut, get to know the get to know the team, get to know the people that are that are working on it. And hopefully the year the year after that, we can we can we can all do something together. I have there's a question that's a really good one. And I'm torn between asking Ian and or Aaron. We'll start with Ian. Since you since you've been through raising funds fairly recently from from from from the VC firms. A question is from Ramesh Varadaraj. The question is, where can we get a list of oil and gas venture firms? Yeah, actually, I don't know where you just go get a list or probably is a way to do that. I mean, I I think you can do research. I mean, they're they're out announcing their their funds and their intentions. You know, again, through network, you know, understanding who are the different firms, you know, what you've got to keep in mind is that each firm has its own kind of thesis. Right. And so you're looking for a firm that aligns with the stage of your company and maybe some of the specifics around your technology and your your business model. And so I would just encourage, you know, again, like the ATC is a great place to kind of step into these conversations and get recommendations. You can certainly do the research on your own or there are a lot of resources out there to find that fit. It's really important to find that correct fit for your organization and for your innovation in particular. But I'm not aware maybe there is a spot where you could just go find a list. It's an it's an exploration as much as anything. Yeah, I mean, a good a good a good amount of research and networking, I think, is is probably the the the the top two the top two places to start. Yeah, I mean, the other advantage you have is these venture firms are trying to be found, right? They're not exactly hiding from startups. They're they're trying to be as public as they can, because obviously both their LPs and their investors want them to get the best most innovative companies to invest in. So, you know, in many senses, they're out looking for you. Right. But the other thing to remember is a lot of these events, like I mentioned, like the ACT, the start of village, the the the Rice Alliance Venture Forms, other events like this, you know, they're going to be there. They may even be sponsoring. Right. So you can go to the Rice Alliance page. You can look at who are all the sponsors on the Rice Alliance page. And that's a good way to start. It's a pretty good list to begin with of all the venture firms and oil and gas. And I'm sure Brian's going to say, you know, at the start of village page, it would be a good list of potential sponsors. Absolutely. Thanks. Aaron, while I have you, there's a question from LinkedIn, which I think you can be perfect to at least kick off the answer to being from a large oil and gas company that is that is looking at innovative technology to looking at investing in companies. This question is from LinkedIn, from Yusuf Hassan Abdullahi. The question is, what is the faith of oil and gas with the current situation of global warming? And the world is directing its energy to solar and hydroelectric energies to run machines. So, I mean, that's a with one minute left in the program, right? That's a question that's easy to knock out. I mean, obviously, oil and gas companies are trying to refine our value proposition, right, to produce a product that is vital, that everyone needs and is part of the energy mix. And we're trying to do that as cleanly as possible and improve our environmental performance. I mean, I think it's an easy way to start. I don't know if any of the other panelists have additional comments. I just want to be respectful of time. I know we only have about a minute left. Yeah, I'll just say I'll bring us back, Naim, maybe to the SP mission statement. This organization is focusing on energy and related energy sources and trying to find out what's the best path forward for our planet and for our industry. So oil, gas and related energy sources are all coming into focus now as we figure out what's the best path forward. So I don't think it's very black and white, as probably everyone knows. But our society and our organization and the reason we're hosting the annual technical conference and the Startup Village is to challenge the boundaries and figure out what's next. That's great, guys. This has been a very invigorating and educational conversation. Just judging from the number of questions and the amount of engagement we've had so far, I think we could easily talk for another 30 minutes on this topic and branch off into some great ones. Maybe with by popular demand, we can come back for a part two of this SP live. Unfortunately, we have run out of time for this session. But Bryant, Aaron, Ian, thank you for your insights to our audience. To learn more about these topics, I invite you to visit the SP Startup Village at the upcoming SP annual technical conference and exhibition between the 16th and 18th of October in San Antonio, Texas. Again, I would love to thank you for your participation, your questions, your comments and for joining us today. We'll see you next time. Thanks for listening to the SP live podcast.

SPE Talks Leadership,"I'm Jason Notouris and this is SPE Talks to Shana Noonan. Welcome to the SPE podcast. If you haven't subscribed yet, we encourage you to do so. Great way to keep up with the latest oil and gas technical trends and valuable information and joining us in studio, a special guest, first episode of the new year, our 2020 SPE president, Shana Noonan. Any big resolutions to turn the page for the calendars? Instead of the standard lose weight, make more money. Again, I'm being a little bit more big picture. So in order to be successful this year as SPE president, I have to make sure that I am healthy. I also am trying still to figure out how to balance my SPE obligations with family. I have a daughter that's going to be graduating high school this year, so I need to make sure that I'm home for graduation in prom and to be getting them set up for college. And then a big thing is really just to stop and smell the roses. And this really hit me when I did one of my visits in December and it was to Quito and people will ask me saying, wow, what was Ecuador like? And I'm, I was there for less than 24 hours. I saw this beautiful city through the windows of a car or my hotel room and I really didn't get a chance to experience it. So that's one thing I'm really going to make a point of doing over this year is during my travels and my visits, just taking the time to go out and enjoy these beautiful cities that our members reside in and or, you know, other areas with oil and gas. So at the end, once I'm done and looking back on my journey as SPE president, again, it's going to be more of something other than just being inside of hotel rooms and corporate offices and that. So that's my big to do. Again, it's going to be interesting because then that's also going to be impacting, it's going to, could be making my trips longer, but it's also going to be more time away from home. So again, trying to find that balance. I haven't figured out yet, but that's one of my big, big resolutions this year. I like that perspective, though. And as someone who likes to multitask, you could always just take your jog while smelling the roses. Yes. All right. So what about New Year traditions? In my family, we eat pork and cabbage, which I like, so there's no problem there. Then we'll also get some confetti, some poppers. This year, something kind of new. So I don't know if you want to call it tradition. I hope it becomes a tradition. My wife took our Christmas tree decorations off and then she replaced them with festive New Year decor. I dig it. I fully support it. So I'm going to add it to our traditions list. What about you? For New Year's tradition that we've started with our neighborhood because we've lived in the same neighborhood now for 20 years and have all the same neighbors. So we do one of these, it's called a progressing dinner where you start off, somebody hosts, say, the appetizers and you all go to that home, have the appetizers and then you move to somebody else's home for the main dinner and then obviously for dessert. And it kind of got a little crazy there for a while because when you have so many families, then we end up having, okay, the pre appetizer house and then the appetizer house. And then by the time you get to the house that's hosting the main dinner, you're already so full that you just can't proceed. So we're trying to be a little smarter this year the way we do it. But that's our New Year's tradition. For me, even being able to see New Year's is a difficult task because I'm always up so early in the morning. I typically get up at a quarter after four. A lot of that was because I always worked with offices, whether they were in Africa or in the Middle East, and that's when you'd have 6 a.m. teleconferences with them. So it's always been a challenge that I actually stay up to see New Year's because I'm typically in bed by about nine thirty. So let's see how it goes this year. Best of luck. And you have just wrapped up a trip to South America and the Caribbean, kicked it off with a women in energy event in Ecuador. What was the response like there? Oh, my goodness. That was the biggest, what I mean biggest as far as number of people at a women in energy event that I've been at. There are over 300 people there. And I mentioned people because, again, it was very diverse in gender and cultures. There were people that came there from all over the world. And the speakers they managed to find were just fantastic. It was all in Spanish, so I had to wear the headset for simultaneous translation. Oh, yeah. Now, when we're talking New Year's resolutions, that's one of my New Year's resolutions is to learn Spanish. There you go. On an app or how are you going to do it? It's going to be I guess I'll have to be an app or something through my computer because I'm traveling so much being able to keep up with it, especially since I'm going to be taking the board back to South America in March. Well, I'm going to have the board meeting in Buenos Aires. So I've promised on the Spanish, but also at the same time when I visited the Brazil section, I mentioned to them that maybe I need to be learning Portuguese. So I have to watch. I think I just need to focus on the one. So let me get the Spanish figured out first. Good chance to impress in March, too. Just touching on a few other items because this looks like a very eventful trip. I'm looking at the agenda, some talks you gave at Unicamp in Brazil. Then you visited all three sections in Argentina. One of the more interesting things that I'm noting here is that you took a picture with a J.P.T. magazine that was printed before you were born. So this was in Rio at the Brazil Regional Awards. A man was recognized for 60 years as an SBE member. 60, like six zero. And he came to the event holding. He said it was the second second J.P.T. It was from 1962. And yes, that J.P.T. was older than I am. And then he also showed up with the first monograph for well logging. He was so proud. He came in holding them like they were, you know, like Moses with the Ten Commandments. He was just so genuine, so appreciative to what SBE did for him. And again, he was just so proud just to have those those original publications. And of course, I'm geeking out. So I was taking pictures of these actual documents, the magazine and also pictures with him. It was fantastic. And have these pictures been thrown up on Twitter, LinkedIn anywhere? Are they coming sometime soon? I put them on my on Twitter and I have a public Facebook page that I'm going to be actually in the next few days uploading those pictures on there as well. Yeah. And S.P. International, I'll make sure to retweet that and share the link to the tweet in the show notes of this. You guys can check out that picture. Let's get into your column, the January column, first column of 2020, strengthening the feedstock of incoming talent into the oil and gas industry. This is a great way to kick off 2020. I always look forward to the start of a new year and the tradition of setting new goals, both professionally and personally. And it provides an opportunity for new beginnings and to make any corrections, if needed, to the direction of one's career and self-development. And this was actually when I was doing the South American tour, we talked about setting goals a lot, especially when I was meeting with the YPs. And I knew that this particular topic about incoming talent, oil and gas industry, I wanted that to be the January column because again, I'm challenging so many parts of our industry to set new goals and set difference in course corrections. And we'll get into that in a little bit here. It's a very ambitious goal. And I hope, at least with this JPT column and with this podcast, kind of stir things up and really start the discussion because I really believe change is needed. Because you walk into any high school worldwide, the perception is that students are less enthusiastic to pursue higher education in oil and gas than they have been in the past. Well, you said perception, but a lot of places we visited, it's not a perception. It's an actual fact. The one thing that I've really learned through my travels too is it's so regionally specific. Places like Russia or even Azerbaijan, where the country embraces and realizes the value that oil and gas has on the economy. So the traction is there for a lot of people to be into oil and gas, whereas you come to Europe or even here in the United States. And we're having problems trying to attract those people. In my column, I talk about a survey that was done by McKinsey and Company. They compiled industry data in 2018 just to show that over the past 10 years, oil and gas industry has dropped in being attractive, for lack of a better term. So in 2009, when we were ranked against all the different industries that were out there, we were ranked the 14th in popularity for people. And when I say people, this is mainly engineers and IT people wanting to come into that industry. And then over 10 years, we've dropped now from 14th down to 35th. And they concluded that given the need for talent, it's critical for the oil and gas industry to deepen and diversify its pool. So how do we change this perception, getting the talented minds to consider oil and gas careers? Before figuring out how to attract the top talent that we need in our industry, we first need to determine what type of talent do we need? And not just now, but again, being strategic, you know, what we're going to need in the future. Now, SB has an online training course that I love. It's called Introduction to the Digital Oil Field. And the instructor, Tony Edward, he talks about how the digital revolution of our industry now requires a change in who we need. He says we need more strong generalists who understand the value chain and the big picture and also have great communication skills. And I talk about this, too, in my travels with the YPs and with the students, because the data that is coming in now is real time. We are going to have to think faster and make decisions a lot quicker. And when we're making those decisions, we're going to need to know a little bit about everything that our decision can impact to make sure that's the right decision. We're not going to have time anymore. Say, for example, myself as a production engineer, I'm not going to necessarily have the time now, say, to react to prevent a downhaul pump failure, to go and check with the facilities engineer and check with the reservoir engineer. I have to know a little bit now how if I were to speed up or slow down that particular pump or even shut it off completely, I'm going to have to know how that decision is going to impact the others. So that's more understanding all the bits of the value chain and then the communication skills, because you can still make those decisions quick. But the thing is, is now you have to communicate effectively so then people can understand what you're trying to do and then they're going to be able to act in the correct manner that they understood you correctly. If the need for change is so immediate, what is holding up the widespread adoption? What course correction should be made to navigate our industry in the right direction to bring in people who have that mindset to help better facilitate some of the roles that are open right now? Well, Jason, I believe that there's just not one issue that's hampering our efforts with attracting that next generation of engineers and geoscientists. I believe there's actually three. The first one's the most obvious, the negative public perception. But then I really believe that it's our unattractive business models, our boom and bust, higher than fire, as well as all the roles that we have within oil and gas. They're difficult to have when you're trying to achieve work-life balance. So let's break these down one at a time then, starting with your first point. OK. Public perception. Negative public perception. Now, I am proud of all the social responsibility and carbon reduction initiatives that my industry, this industry has embarked on. And I'm very proud to be part of the global solution to end poverty. And this is the way I typically end a lot of my presentations when I travel. Now, our industry and SBE, we've been working very hard on public education. And it hasn't been easy. You know, we all need to learn how to have effective conversations about what our industry does and how we lift the world's population out of energy poverty, which results in increasing the quality of life. And we just need to put away the PowerPoint presentations and tell our story. There's a TED talk when it talks about effective public speaking. And there's a quote from that saying that bullets are for the military, dashes are for the Olympics. They don't belong in a presentation. Because we're engineers and we're scientists, just being able to just to sit and have a conversation without having to pull out a graph or citing statistics is hard because that's that's that's our comfort zone. And so we've been trying to find ways to teach our own members how to tell the story. Now, creating this narrative was part of SBE's strategic plan, and we just launched a new website. It's called Fueling Progress. And it's actually a place now where we're collecting stories from those who have been really good at having these conversations and the way to educate our own members. But even some wonderful stories on how people and I'll give an example because we're just reaching out to the young engineer that I met while I was in Ecuador. And she came from a small community in Ecuador that there was a new oil and gas development basically going right across the road from her own family home. And they had a lot of negativity about what the oil and gas was doing. And it was a lot of it was because they just didn't understand. Well, years later now, she's become a petroleum engineer. She's been a very valuable SBE member and she's been going back into the communities like her own in Ecuador to educate them. And I guess it's almost I wouldn't say it's necessarily a fear per se. But again, helping the communities understand that the importance not only in the economy, but also, too, for the community with with educating. I'll give another great example, too, when I was in Papua New Guinea, ExxonMobil has a big LNG plant that's there in Papua New Guinea. And they were wonderful hosts for me when I visited there. But the biggest thing I took away and it wasn't from the plant itself again. OK, I'm an engineer. I was geeking out going through the plant. But it was what they've done for the country. The way ExxonMobil said is as far as the expats, their sole role is to work themselves out of a job because that facility has to be sustainable by the local community. It's been embraced, but just the level of education, the economy has flourished. That's just a wonderful example of what oil and gas can do in a much bigger scale. And it's stories like that that we're going to be using this Fueling Progress blog for, because then if if we find it difficult to tell our own story, we can use these in our conversations with others as to telling all the other different stories that are out there. And then then things become a lot easier and the conversations just become a lot more fruitful. And what you're mentioning in these examples, there's much more of a connection with that because nothing against presentations or slide decks or the the bullets and the dashes, as you mentioned. But younger audiences do respond and retain better through more storytelling approaches. And this could be through video, through interactive websites, through podcasts, through social media. All of these are engaging forms of communication that inform on a more personal level. The incoming generation, the millennials, the generation Zeds, it's already been very well documented that in order for them not only to learn or to contribute, they need to have a sense of engagement. And you just can't do that by just throwing out a bunch of facts and having sit through a PowerPoint. And then on to your second point, because I know you had mentioned that throughout this this one, two, three point process, the first point may be one of the easier ones to accomplish. Two and three are the bigger hindrances right now. Well, I wouldn't necessarily say that correcting negative public perception is easy. Definitely not. But I firmly believe that even if we even if everybody on this planet had a very positive outlook, or, you know, on oil and gas, there's still the two other big challenges that are out there that are hampering. And so let's get into our business models. You know, this is something that we haven't really talked about or challenged, but we got very poor business models, again, the boom and bust and the higher than fire. And, you know, just like any commodity market, we can't control global supply and demand cycles. And unfortunately, our industry has a reputation of staffing levels that are just a cyclical. And then we've got our poor academic institutions that are trying to pump out enough graduates to meet the demands of a very cyclical oil and gas. And then they're stuck even in a worse position, because typically, you know, they're reacting a couple years after the fact. So, you know, just when their graduation levels are the highest, we're already now a year or two years into a downturn. And then a lot of these students are not able to get jobs. You know, many companies, they increase the amount of staff when times are good, and then have massive layoffs during the downturn. And this is more prevalent, especially with the service providers, you know, and of course, it's always the latter that makes the newspaper headlines. It's rare that you see that, oh, it's a great time and oil and gas and employment, lots of positions open, they tend to always look at more the negative side of things and talk about all the layoffs that we have. Well, job security is always important. It's always been important for everybody. But now with the incoming generation, they'd much rather have a sense of job security than a bigger paycheck. And, you know, with the reputation our industry has with our business models, you know, a lot of them are not necessarily seeing that job security. So they're going to other industries that that, you know, they think they would get more of that. While the Permian Basin is one of the most active and populous regions, because of the unconventional shale boom, you know, this region struggles with attracting local young talent, because they are witness to how their families and communities were dramatically impacted during the last downturn. Now, there are several companies that have adopted a different business model. And that's basically running a lean organization in terms of staffing, regardless of the cycles. And I'm proud to say I work for one of those companies that didn't reduce staff during the downturn at all. Now, those engineers that didn't have rigs to run or well sites to build, you know, they were utilized elsewhere within the company temporarily. And I use this example of my own organization to demonstrate to my peers that there can be a successful alternative to, again, the higher and higher than the boom and bust, a better organization to respond to the ups and downs of industry activity. Now, understandably, you know, finding a better organization model will be more difficult for other areas of our business, such as with service providers or drilling companies. There's actually an interesting chart that's in my article that actually shows the employment in oil and gas. And it's split from those that are involved from drilling, more of the support services, the service providers, and then the oil and gas producers. And the most significant starting in late 2014, the most significant drop in employment levels were those on the drilling on the service side. So you know, that's not a surprise, but they're going to be a little bit more challenged to find a better business model, because it's difficult for them to say adapt a lean, because what they're doing is they're responding to oil and gas companies such as mine when, you know, things are good. Okay, our service providers were ramping up activity, and then of course, they need the staff for it. But during my travels now and having conversations with some of the biggest service providers, I'm really encouraged that there's implementing initiatives to mitigate the loss of talent that they've invested to train during the downturns as well. Now, in order to be moving faster, what I'm trying to do at least as president is just to keep engaging with companies on, you know, looking at their business models being more sustainable as far as staff. And then when I do get the stories from those companies such as my own, and with the service providers, I'm going to be very vocal about it showing these examples. And then hopefully, people will learn from that and adapt their models as well. Because there is no sugarcoating it, the business model will likely not be an overnight change. But it is good to hear that decision makers are engaging in conversations for solutions, and that we're already seeing some successes adapting some of these new models. But I'm sure with some of these new practices, it's also going to change some of the day to day routines for the employee. So we've talked a little bit about the employer and those conversations happening. But how the employee is affected by these business model changes. That's another area that I've heard needs to be addressed. We need to be changing a lot of our roles. And we have, we have such an advantage with the digital revolution to do that. Because you know, the third challenge, okay, first, if we get the positive public perception, and we get better business models, we still have another issue out there with the work life balance that are hampering people from coming in. And I really believe that it's the work life balance issue in our industry, that is hampering our efforts to increase both cultural and gender diversity. Now, in my engineering career, I've dealt with solving difficult problems. But the most challenging for me has really just been figuring out how to balance my career with raising two daughters alongside a working spouse. Now, there's so many roles within our business that they're hard for working parent to hold, especially if they're a single parent. A lot of these are more in fields of operations, or even in manufacturing plants, a lot of roles where you happen to travel and be away from family. Now, when I entered into this industry, I knew that I knew and accepted the fact that there are going to be roles or opportunities I'd have to turn down because I wanted work life balance. I firmly believe I could be a lot further in my career that I am now, if I had not turned opportunities to be moving my family international several times over my career, or that would have me away from home a month or more at a time. And I accepted that. And, you know, I'm still proud of those decisions. But the thing is, times have changed. And the incoming generation, they're selecting career paths to ensure that they don't have to be faced with the decisions that I did, in order to have the balance. You make a good point here. For me, I would use the term sacrifice because you can only fill yourself up with so much time in the day. And you're going to need to sacrifice somewhere with work and life in one direction or another teeter tottering back and forth, whether it be throughout the day, throughout the week, throughout the month, throughout the duration of the job that you're holding. So it's making the choices that you think will be best for you, but also trying not to hurt your career growth along the same way, because there's only so much that we can do. In my article, I actually have several quotes and statistics on this. And we're gonna have to change. This is something that really is holding people back from entering our industry, especially if we're trying to increase diversity, gender diversity. First of all, we need to get those people into our industry, right. But then there's a point where say five years in, now we're losing a lot of our engineers and geoscientists and a lot of women and that all happens to be when people are having families. It's there, we can see it that we're losing not getting people in, but we're losing people from staying in our industry because they're not getting that work life balance. It's even more critical for the younger generations that are coming in. Now, I mentioned in my article and also earlier in this podcast about this McKinsey study, you know, and it was recommended that, you know, we really need to create and communicate to young workers the possibility that there are flexible career paths. And developing such pathways will benefit both men and women, but probably women a bit more, setting them up for future success. You know, if young workers can see a way to balance career and family, they may be more likely, not only wanting to come into the industry, but then likely want to stay. And the digital transformation that our industry is going through right now, you know, it's enabling companies to revise roles and positions to offer better flexibility for work life balance. There's a quote that another quote that I say that, you know, jobs are no longer in spaces, but they're portable workplaces. And that really, you know, offers more ways to redefine jobs to be a lot more flexible. But I am really concerned whether we're doing enough to keep pace with the needs of the next generation in this area. So one of my objectives as your president, during my visits with the young professionals, and even the corporate supporters is to encourage more rapid adoption of initiatives for better work life balance. That women in energy event that I did in Quito, there were many presentations on this, and there were a lot of people from human resource departments that were there in attendance. One of the takeaways that came from that was we're going to need both to create change, we need to communicate more with our own human resource staff, to let them know what these job roles could look like, and then they can make the changes organizationally, and then be able to attract those people into them. So it's not going to be us waiting to let part of our business make that change. We're going to actually have to help guide them as to how those roles can look like. So again, it's the roles that are still adding value to the company, but also to their offering that work life balance. Because during your travels, you've given really good presentation, investing in yourself and your career. Most recently, a few young professional audiences got to hear that presentation. It does sound like an interesting discussion about career goals, specifically for the younger generations. When we're talking about coming into the new year and setting goals, I recently was giving this presentation, it was the premise was basically investing in yourself. But a lot of that investment was investing into strengthening your communication skills. For example, something that I would say in a group of my fellow Canadians, if I were to have that same conversation, say with someone from Asia Pacific, the perception and understanding of what we're talking about could be completely different. So it's always being aware of who your audience is, and the way they perceive things in order to communicate effectively. So Jason, we've covered a lot of issues now in this podcast all around strengthening the feedstock of incoming talent. And, you know, if we're to do this, we need to provide a feeling of belonging, making a difference, job security, and work-life balance. And this is going to be in tall order because we're an industry that's not known for providing any of these elements. And it's a significant change in direction to where industry has traveled for decades. And again, I timed the subject of this column to the beginning of the new year because this is the time of year when we're starting to set our goals and to be making course corrections, whether it's in our career. And now I'm again challenging that as us as an industry, we need to be doing a course correction. You know, we need to ensure that our future workforce is the most talented, diverse, and innovative. But if we can't get this talent into our industry, that's a huge problem. And I end my GPT column by saying that if we can't get this talent into our industry, our future may be history. It was very blunt, but I was really trying to be strong with this emphasis because I want my industry that I love and I'm so passionate about to thrive. When we see the energy forecast for the future and the needs to be reducing energy poverty around the planet, it's critical that oil and gas is there because we're part of the solution, but we can't provide that solution if we don't have those innovative minds to drive the advancements that are going to be needed because, you know, finding oil and gas, it's getting harder and harder. Things are a lot more complex. This is so important on a global scale that we need to be emphasizing and getting those people in now. And, you know, if someone were to ask me what keeps me up at night or that worries, it's this very particular thing. And I'm going to be emphasizing this throughout the rest of my term as SBA president, but even beyond. And then hopefully then I'm just not a single voice. We have the voice of many more of our members to be driving this, getting out into the schools, working with the teachers, having effective conversations even with our own children to make this serious course correction because it has to get done. And it's almost a shame that this is a podcast and not a video because just for our listeners, I need to describe that Shawna's not reading words off of a piece of paper here. You can see the passion and the drive that she has for this message. And it's not just something that's coming off of a whim. You can tell that there's levels in depth of thought that has gone into this. And I really hope this helps spark a conversation. Use hashtag SPE podcast, send her an email, talk to us about this.

New Technology Trends with Greg Leveille,"This is SPE Talks Tech, HSE and COVID-19. On April 7th, 2020, SPE went live for the first time on LinkedIn with a panel discussing the impact of the global pandemic on upstream oil and gas. COVID-19 has brought much of the world to a grinding halt and to date has left more than half of the world's population restricting their movements to only within their own homes. Our panel met an engaged audience with highly informed expertise that we hope helps our listeners navigate the COVID-19 and oil crisis. So with that introduction, let's hand it over to SPE Technical Director of HSE and Sustainability, Joanna Dunlop. This is the first, it's the first SPE live cast and I'm proud that the Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability discipline is the first discipline that's participating in this new approach to engaging with our members and engaging beyond the SPE. We've got seven technical disciplines in the SPE and I think we're the only professional association that welcomes health, safety, environment and sustainability professionals along with drilling completions and more core technical disciplines and we've got some of the finest HSE professionals in the industry or members of the SPE and it's a comfort to me to know that many of you are listening in and really delighted to be with you here today. It's exciting because it's a first live cast at the same time. It's extremely sober. We're in the middle of a huge crisis. We've been in crisis mode in the industry since the middle of January because of the international nature of the industry. Sometimes we're ahead of the curve and we were ahead of the curve in many, many countries and our speakers today are going to share some insight to what their companies have been doing to manage this crisis, protect their people and also to protect their operations. So welcome everybody. We're in for about 40 minutes of listening to our wonderful panellists and having some Q&A so don't forget to send in your questions. We look forward to lots of interaction with you. So I'd like to introduce you to your four panellists today. We start with Francesca Viviani, who's the Director of Public Health for International SOS. Francesca is also serving on the IOGP and IPCA Joint Health Committee and always delighted to have you Francesca with us at SPE. We always enjoy your presentations. Francesca has been working in crisis management for over 15 years and is directing the public health programming for international SOS interfacing with our industries, supporting the oil and gas industry, but also many other industries. She's also worked with NGOs and UN agencies, so incredible perspectives that she's able to bring to us. After Francesca, we're going to hear from Dr. Frederick Jevel from Equinor. Hi, Frederick, good to see you. Frederick's a specialist in occupational medicine. He's the leading advisor for medical services, also on the Joint Health Committee of IOGP and IPCA and has been on the front line basically since the middle of January managing the COVID crisis for Equinor and also supporting the industry through the Joint Health Committee. We're then going to hear from Mark. Mark Scanlon, who is leading the HSE practice. Hi, Mark at the Energy Institute, working collaboratively with a lot of international stakeholders, leading up team project managers, supporting our industry, but also supporting renewables and hydrogen, carbon capital, so quite a range of perspectives there. Looking forward to hearing from you, Mark, and the work that you've been doing under very stressful circumstances on creating COVID-specific bow ties. Then we'll hear from Rium Johnson. Rium is the chief HSE officer for NOV, a service company. She started at their Next Generation program and very quickly established herself, moved over into corporate engineering and worked on their Tier 4 emissions management program and started creating NOV Ventures. She moved over to R&D, built the flagship technical center, was then named as VP of R&D technical center for NOV, and then in 2019 came into her HSE role. It's always wonderful to have people come into these roles who come from operations and R&D backgrounds because you bring in fresh eyes to us, the geeks of the HSE function, and it's great to have that mix of perspectives. I know already in your six months you've made your mark and are very supportive of the function. So, with no further ado, I'd like to pass the camera and the mic over to Francesca. Over to you. Thanks, Joanna, and thanks, SP, for organizing this live event. Welcome to you all. I think Joanna is a first for everybody. It's a first for me also to do something like this. I would like to start providing just some general context for all of us on what we are talking about. As you know, towards the end of December 2019, authorities in Wuhan, in Ube province, announced a cluster of cases of pneumonia associated with a wholesale market. The virus was subsequently identified as a new virus never circulated in human people before, and the virus was called SARS-CoV-2. The disease associated with this virus is called COVID-19. On the 30th of January 2020, the WHO declared the spread and outbreak of COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. This is part of international regulations for improving health for everybody. At the time of the declaration, there were less than 8,000 cases confirmed worldwide and 19 countries. As Michael was reminding us at the beginning, we are now around almost 1,484 countries are affected, this in less than four months. What did the oil and gas sector do? The oil and gas sector, as Joana was mentioning, reacted extremely promptly. They started to organize themselves even before the public health emergency was declared. For international SS 25, we immediately activated our business continuity plan. Why did the sector react so promptly and differently from others? The main priority for the sector is and will remain the health and safety and well-being of employees, their families, as well as the community where the sector operates. This is really important because this has created some structure and places that the sector can use. Firstly, the sector has measures in place for the control of infectious disease transmission, especially inside the fence, being this platform or onshore location. What happened with the COVID-19 was that these measures were constantly updated by the company to reflect the daily knowledge we gain on this COVID-19. And I know that Frederick will give us a fantastic example on the importance of this aspect. Secondly, another priority, another specialty was the fact that we learned during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, 2015, how a health event that is not promptly managed can become a crisis of a much bigger scale. At the time of the Ebola outbreak, I was doing some research about outbreak preparation and collaboration between multiple stakeholders. And what we identified was that a key component of the business continuity response was collaboration and partnership. Companies might have collaborated with different stakeholders and with different groups. And we found out that the same strategy happened with the COVID-19. All the companies activated, they crossed this management time immediately. They transferred lessons learned from certain countries that were affected at the beginning, especially China. They shared PPE where they were needed, not they were stocked. So when they were needed in China, these were moved and then they moved to Europe and now eventually to the States. And finally, they share best practice among all the operators. The Health Committee of IOGP, PIECA convened for the first time already in January, and we started to share experience among not only the companies, but the whole sector. This is important. This is essential and gave a very good way for the sector to respond to this. Especially if you consider the 11th of March 2020, WHO considered the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic. Nothing happened or changed with the virus. What happened was that suddenly everybody in every country was affected. I suppose all of you have become now very familiar with the epidemiological curves that describe the spread of the virus, as well as how different measures can impact and alter this type of shape. Well, these are the same curves together with scenarios that the company used for making decisions as part of their business continuity plan. During the initial growth of the transmission, when the cases were still fewer, companies put in place different control measures or prevention barriers. And these were about reducing the risk of infection in the workplace. During the rapid growth phase, when the things started to go very wrong, as they because of the lockdown, because of a very precautionary approach, companies decided to have a work from home policy and they started to support with a wellness program and well-being and psychosocial support and stress. Let's remind that also most companies remained operational and are still operational. So we still have people working on oilfield. In this case, the measures became much stricter. What we are seeing now, either in countries that are on the declining phase or countries that are preparing for a return to a new normal, the priority and the measures are changing. Companies put in place the same measures that they had at the beginning when they grow of the epidemic, as well as new things that we are developing as we go along. There is an increasing talk of masks or rapid testing, all things that are coming out now that may not have been available in the past. What is important is that we know that nothing function in isolation and there is no silver bullet. So collaboration and discussion and events like these are fundamental for the sector to move on. And these were my initial remarks. Thanks. Thank you very much, Francesca, and reminding us also that most companies are still operational and that we are learning every day. There is this new normal and new measures coming in, but there is no silver bullet. Let's pass over now to Frederick and hear how Equinor is managing the COVID crisis. Frederick, welcome. Thank you for being with us today. Thank you and thank Michael for having SP arrange this. It is very interesting to participate. Francesca mentioned collaboration and I would like to start off by saying that we have a long standing relationship with ISOS and terrific collaboration with ISOS, especially for this event. I wouldn't call it an incident. It is too big a scale. Great support from ISOS and we have also really appreciated our collaboration and support from our peers. Sharing is very important here. And we are trying to share what we can and receiving great support from our colleagues in the other oil and gas operators. Jason, could you show my screen, please? I'm going to talk a little bit about how Equinor has approached COVID in an offshore setting. We have managed so far to keep all our installations operational. It has been challenging and we have learned a lot. For those of you who don't know Equinor, we are a Norwegian oil and gas company with a global presence in all regions of the world. We operate mainly on the Norwegian continental shelf, but also in the UK sector in Europe, and in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. And we have exploration activities in many other locations. Let's see. There we go. Just to start off, COVID-19 is for us doctors, it is novel, yes, but it is not new, it is not unknown. Managing infectious disease offshore is something we have been doing for 40 years. We have a lot of experience in keeping our people healthy and safe offshore. For COVID-19, we use the same principles as we have for all other infectious diseases. We prevent the infection from coming offshore. When it does, we contain it and medevac our afflicted staff safely. A few important principles that we have used for this one is we have developed a bow tie model for the organisation. We are working very hard on social distancing. I will get into that later. We are also quite strict on testing. We test a lot. And we quarantine and sanitise when we have a case. I am going to start by showing a case study from 2018. This was not COVID. This was a virus called sapovirus, which is a relative of norovirus. It causes gastroenteritis, mainly diarrhea. This happened on one of our larger installations during turnaround. We had 462 people offshore at the time. The index event was a person vomiting and then failing to self-quarantine in the public toilets at May 12. Four days later, we had 15 cases of people puking and having diarrhea in their cabins. This was quickly identified as an outbreak. Containment measures were introduced. Basically, isolate, start cleaning. We have a whole set of procedures that we use for common areas. Everything was shut down. And cleaning frequency increased. We started testing for the virus. The normal test procedure in Norway goes only for norovirus. We missed the diagnosis. We didn't identify the agent until May 20 when we had a new resurgence of the outbreak. Up to 17 cases in one day. Then we identified it was sapovirus. That knowledge is really important because it tells you that for sapovirus, you need to isolate them for 48 hours instead of just 24 with norovirus. The incubation time is longer as well. We used that knowledge to strengthen our quarantine and containment measures and managed to break the outbreak over the next week. The main factor in this outbreak was an underreporting of symptoms. This was during turnaround where you have a lot of people, contractors and subcontractors offshore, who will lose their income if they don't show up to work. They didn't report symptoms and they failed to self-isolate. That led to a delay in or prolongation of turnaround by three days, which was a considerable impact for us. By June 8, we were quite sure that this outbreak was over and we ended our containment measures. The simple measures that we used here, we also used for COVID. Joanna asked me, how does one operate offshore in the time of COVID? The answer is at the distance. We practice strict social distancing. Basically all the measures that we introduced for managing sapovirus, we are now constantly active on all our installations. Gyms and common rooms are very important. We have a lot of people who are in the hospital, who are in the hospital, who are in the hospital and who are in all our installations. Gyms and common rooms are all closed. People basically work, eat and go to their cabins. We have staggered meal times to increase distance, as you can see in this picture. We don't have any buffets. All meals are served or plastic wrapped. All meetings are conducted with social distancing or by video. We disinfect everything several times per day. And people are very well aware that if they have symptoms, they self-isolate and then call the medic instead of showing up. We have reduced our manning to operational levels. We have delayed a lot of non-critical maintenance. And the helicopter companies with whom we collaborate quite well, or excellently, have reduced their flights to 12 passengers from the normal 18, just to be able to maintain distancing in the helicopter as well. This is all to reduce the number of close contacts if there is a case and also reduce the possibilities of transmission. So if we have a case of fur, we divide it into high probability, medium probability or low probability. For the high probability, we isolate, we test, we quarantine all close contacts. For the medium probabilities, we isolate and test, but we ask the close contacts to self-monitor. And for the low probabilities, the common colds, simple allergies, we isolate them until they're well plus one day. We test them, but we do contact tracing in case the situation develops. So far on the Norwegian continental shelf, we have tested 19 people. I forgot to update the slide. We have had only one case positive. And the prevalence in Norway, fortunately, is quite low. Testing is important because it ensures that we can identify a case and medevac only the case that we need to medevac. It also prevents disruption to our operations. Having 20 people in quarantine is difficult. And it reduces fear. Fear is really important here because your employees need to feel safe when they're off shore. They can't have their focus on being afraid of a disease. They need to focus on their safety critical work. So being able to test people offshore and in 18 out of 19 cases stand down is incredibly important to maintain operations for us. I'm going to, and I'm sorry for the busy slide, I'm going to quickly delve into the one case we have had at the Martinlinje installation. This was March 9th. We had an Equinor employee who came offshore March 4th after returning from Austria. We added Austria to our high risk list on March 9th where the person reporting the case with symptoms was isolated in cabin and we did contact tracing, found 35 close contacts, including most of the management team. This was challenging. POV at the time was 776, including two hotels because it was a cold platform undergoing construction. So we tested the individual. We flew the test to a hospital and we were able to test the patient. We were able to test the patient. We were able to test the patient. We tested the individual. We flew the test to a hospital by a SAR helicopter. It took two days to get the results, which was positive. So then we medevaced the index case and one more contact. For the whole duration of this, our incident management team was mobilized and still things were still quite in flux. This was when it was quite new. So we decided to demobilize everyone, not quarantine, nonessential staff. That was 650 people. We also returned the hotel onshore. We did further testing of six close contacts with symptoms, developed symptoms. They turned out to be negative. So now the entire installation has been sanitized. The hotel has been sanitized and two weeks after the evacuation, we've started remobilizing. Principles are the same. Isolate, quarantine close contacts, maintain safety. This is crucial. Then demobilize your nonessentials and regain control to remobilize. It's a good way to manage fear. It's a good way to manage operations. I'll quickly go into this bow tie model we created as well. On the left side, you can see your likelihood reducing measures. On the right hand side, you can see your consequence reducing measures, where the index event is one person infected at an offshore installation. First, you need your public medical infrastructure and your local government to reduce the likelihood or the prevalence of disease in your population. You need to have a sick leave policy so that people who are sick don't actually show up to work. Travel restrictions to reduce the likelihood of some of your employees becoming sick or infected. Employees need to be aware. You need to have a travel contact quarantine policy so that people don't go to work. And access control is a final barrier, but it's not a very good one. To prevent further cases, you have your social distancing and sanitation measures. You have your identification and quarantining of close contacts. And to reduce disturbance of operations, we rely on employee confidence. It's really important to us that our people are safe and feel safe. So we collaborate with the authorities to have people tested, to have the resources we need. We have a robust company, so we haven't had large disruptions to our operations yet, thankfully. Subject to change. Thank you, Johanna. I will leave it over to the next speaker now. It's really, really interesting and very impressive to see the level of mobilization and the depth of knowledge that you're deploying. I really liked your mention of collaboration and sharing. It's something the industry is good at. And really liked some of the transparency in showing where things haven't worked out in the past and that you're willing to share that. I think that's really, really, really important. That's how we learn. Liked your shift of vocabulary, not using the word incident, but event and novel, but not unknown. It's true. I've been working with the US government for over 40 years and has incredible knowledge through medical officers like yourself. Really interesting to see your point about underreporting of sentence and think this is something we really need to keep well within our sites. It's good to see companies, so many companies, being really proactive in how they're going to protect their employees at the same time. We're in the middle of an oil price crisis as well. There are a lot of incentives for underreporting. It's also interesting from a mental health point of view, the kind of stresses that people are putting themselves under. One to watch really, really carefully. Your message about confidence and reducing fear is a really important one. Just before we hand over to Mark, I'd like to take a question from the audience for you which is, you said test, test, test. You're doing a lot of testing. A member of the audience wants to know how you acquired test kits? Collaboration with the authorities and local laboratories at the hospitals we usually send our patients to. They've been very gracious with us. Norwegian testing criteria aren't, they don't normally include our population. But the consequence of a confirmed case offshore, we managed to communicate with the hospitals and have achieved testing capability to a certain extent. Not necessarily as many as we would like, but testing is short to come by at the moment. It's a major issue and there's some divergence as well amongst the scientists as to the role that testing can play. Let me hand over to Mark who's got a question for you. Then Mark, I'll let you move straight into your presentation if that's okay with you. That's fine. Thanks very much, Frederick. My question was about repatriation of people where you consider medifac. Say for example, you're operating a facility in the Norwegian sector, an infected one, and the worker was not from Norway, for example, they're a contractor worker and you contemplate medifac. Would they be medifac'd back to Norway or their country of origin, for example, if it's from elsewhere in the North Sea? We've actually had that issue come up, not for infected but for suspected contacts. It's a challenging issue that you have to manage on a case-by-case basis, depending on where that person has to be repatriated. My medical instinct, if they are close contacts, is to quarantine them in a hotel on arrival to shore. You can be sure of the quality of the medical services and take good care of your employees, but this is done case-by-case really. It's hard to find the proper guiding principle other than safety. Very good. I have not repatriated individuals. Over to you, Mark, if you'd like to make a presentation. No problem. Let's far away. I'll just have to fire up my screen. Just hold on for a second. I'll be talking about a Covid-19 bow tie. This is a bow tie that visualises your role in the pandemic. We've just heard the word collaboration several times. Whilst I'm presenting this today, this is really on behalf of a group of individuals who over the last couple of weeks have developed this bow tie and this supporting document. Those individuals are listed there, so the ABS group, Martin Johnson, Royals of Utech and Charles Cowley of the Centre for Chemical Process Safety. Those individuals are really bow tie specialists rather than medics. What you'll find in the next set of slides is an overview of what that bow tie contains, also how it was developed and also a bit of the reason why it was developed as well. Moving on to the next slide. For those that don't know, there is actually an industry resource that covers bow ties in risk management. That was published a couple of years ago by the Centre for Chemical Process Safety and the Indian Institute. Published in September 2018. It was all VGL and also with the support of CGE Risk as well. That work was done collaboratively under the direction of around 20 risk specialists from around the USA through Europe as far away as India as well. The particular benefit of this piece of work is that it is an industry good practice consensus guide. It clarifies bow tie terminology, gives you guidance on how to lay the map out, illustrates practical uses, covers lots of dos and don'ts and tips. Also introduces a concept of multibow ties and human factors or bow tie ties. In a way, the reason why that was developed was to try and consolidate industry knowledge which hitherto had been associated with particular software products and particular organisations that had expertise in developing bow ties. Of course, some companies had used extensively in risk management processes. As well as the core team of 20 people, there was also around 30 proactive stakeholders that did that work. This presentation, I'll keep referring to that graphic on the right hand side is the place where you can freely access the bow tie developed by that group that was listed on the first slide. There's a web address in the bottom right hand corner. On that web address, which is a bit like the Energy Institute's page for its members about COVID-19, there is actually a link to a technical resource. You have to read a blog and then at the end of that there is a link to the technical resource. The web address will appear on other pages as well. The reason why we generated this bow tie was that the Worsome bow ties circulate that weren't aligned to the CCP PES and EI guidance. Maybe some of the threats were in the wrong place or some gave a false sense of security as they contained too many barriers in inverted commas. Those weren't barriers because they don't stop an accident trajectory. So commonly and hitherto bow ties have been associated with representing prevention and mitigation measures, in particular for major accidents, but there are also things like work at height on the safety side. There's a lot of experience in paying out those bow ties, but the guide promotes consistency. Probably until recently there hasn't been a bow ties for things like COVID-19. A subset of the members of that CCP PES stroke EI project team agreed to develop a consensus bow tie. So a group decision on what that bow tie should contain, a decision on how it should be laid out, and also the centre bit about what the hazard and the top event are using bow tie terminology, and also what the threats are and the consequences. So there's the web address again, and there is also a link to that site from CCP PES as well from their own website. So moving on to the principles embodied in this bow tie. The first thing is rather oddly there's no new advice. So what I mean by that is there's no new medical advice. Anything that's listed on the bow tie has come from either the UK government or the Centre for Disease Control. Now if you say, well, I'm not in USA or UK, what you should do is in the context of your own government and health institutions. So think about what they're saying and whether it aligns to this bow tie. If something is different, then the reality is you need to apply your local requirements. So the odd thing in this bow tie is that the top event in the centre of that diagram, that red blob, focuses on an individual. So whether it's someone at work or someone at home or someone who might ordinarily go to work, who's currently at home or a bit like Frederick says, someone on an offshore installation, it focuses on the individual and the top event is that individual being infected by the virus. So the common thing with bow ties and how they're laid out is on the left hand side, you'll identify threats and on the right hand side, you identify consequences. And on those threat lines or consequence lines, you'll see this will be expanded into further detail in the subsequent slides, where you see plus or minus as a way of expanding the level of detail there. But the key thing to note on that summary is that there are only two threat lines on the left hand side and three consequences identified on the right hand side, one of which is the death of the individual, that's the ultimate consequence of someone being infected. And the alternative is death of people that you transfer the virus to, or there's another effect which kind of links to mental health about the effects of protracted lockdown. So we'll look at some of those elements in a bit more detail. One of the points to keep making, that I need to keep making, is look at that website because you can access the document freely that contains far more information and explains more about how the document and the bow tie itself have been constructed. So looking at prevention barriers, so they're located on the left hand side, so they stop the two threats that are listed leading to the top event, that's the person being infected by the virus. But as you'll see with this, there's actually only two threats, and one is about airborne transfer of the virus, and the other one's about contact with infected surfaces. And you'll see that the barriers, each barrier tries to stop the progress of that threat leading to the top event. Normally we call that an accident trajectory. And where you see those plus signs, there's additional detail that underpins those barriers, the strength of those barriers or challenges to those barriers. And we'll look at some more about that in a moment on a subsequent slide. So the left hand side about preventing the progress of the virus and picking on one of those barriers in particular, which is highlighted there, and just expanding it out a little bit. So the barrier is about self isolation. I stay at home and avoid all contacts and gatherings. And if you look at the additional detail here, what you'll find is there's two degradation factors and two pathways with controls on them. They're not called barriers because they can't stop the progress of the threats to the central, hello, to the top event, hold on. And here there are only controls listed. Sorry, excuse me, my screens are doing something. So moving on to the right hand side of the bow tie, the barriers here stop the individual either leading to their own death, the death of other people infected by that individual. So they're the consequences on the right hand side or to find or the other consequence listed is a protracted lockdown. Note here again, you can break this out into further additional detail in barrier degradation pathways. And these aren't shown for the right hand side. So on to the last slide here. That's actually a miniature view of what the whole bow tie looks like. Clearly, you need to look at the source document to actually look at that in detail and study it for yourself and zoom in on all the different areas. Looking at the threats, the degradation factors and the controls ultimately leading to the consequences. So what stops the threats ultimately leading to the top event and then on to those particular consequences listed. So a version of the bow tie was published on the 31st of March and currently some industry feedback has been rationalised with the intent to issue a new version of that bow tie responding to that feedback in the next few days. So the working group has actually discussed that bow tie and some of that feedback with a view to updating the bow tie and the document that surrounds the bow tie as well, which is available from EI or CCPS. So we do intend to revise the bow tie again if there's any further feedback, maybe not every week, but less frequently than that. And we're also thinking about whether there's a benefit in developing an exemplar bow tie for an offshore installation manager or maybe one a bit like Frederick showed, but probably using this type of structure for an organisation. So one other point of credit as well as the people listed here on the last slide, just to note that the bow ties in the document were developed using ABS's thesis software. Other software can actually be used to develop that bow ties as well. So the final thing from me is again about collaboration, just to say thanks to the contributors, Mark Minton, Martin Johnson, Rob Miles and Charles Cowley. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mark. Really interesting presentation, I guess a sign of our times, we're all working from home, so I know there was a bit of a lag there with the internet, but I think the slides helped a lot. So thank you very much, Mark, and really congratulations to the Energy Ins"
SPE Live Discussion on COVID-19,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast. I'm Asha Robles, SPE's multimedia producer. Today we're doing things a little differently and recapping our listeners' top podcast episodes from the past few months. We're starting the show off with our Nathan Nguyen episode. He is the author of 2019's most downloaded OnePetro paper, The End of Petroleum Engineering as We Know It, and the 2016 SPE President. In this episode, host Trent Jacobs explores the depths of the popular paper and looking for an answer to Should I Pursue a Career in Petroleum Engineering? So I wanted to get into this paper, The End of Petroleum Engineering as We Know It. This is a super compelling headline from somebody who writes headlines. Good job. What does it mean? Well first, it's not my prediction that petroleum engineering is over. It is a way to start this discussion about what petroleum engineering is going to evolve to. And I think the evolution and the needed changes we're going to have are a little more radical than some people think. I think that the kind of petroleum engineering that I learned and that I spent much of my career doing is kind of a thing of the past. Okay, well give me an example. What kind of changes are you seeing coming down the pike? Well the first and most compelling is related to the digital revolution. We are changing how we do business. We're changing how we use engineers. AI is sort of not quite there yet and we're using it in certain ways, but my prediction here is that it's going to continue to change, change, and change what we do and how we approach it. The next of course is related to environmental issues, carbon management. Our industry is under pressure like it's never been under before. We're going to have potentially declining demand for some of our products. You know, we're going to have to compete with renewables. We're going to have to be cleaner. We're going to have to be more sustainable. We're going to have to figure out a way to actually capture carbon and lower our footprints. Otherwise we're not going to attract the best and the brightest. For much of my career it's been really easy to attract petroleum engineers, at least during the boom times. We were able to get the best students. We were able to attract students from other industries, as well as chemical engineers, mechanical engineers. We're not really seeing those students be as interested in petroleum engineering now and unless we have a better model, we're not going to be able to retain them and attract them. Well, I heard you speak about this recently at an SB symposium and it was really compelling the way you outlined this thesis. One of the things that stood out to me was that you said in your research these environmental concerns, which are mounting globally, it seems like every day we sort of get a new angle on that story. But that wasn't necessarily the number one reason that we were having trouble as an industry pulling in new recruits. What was the number one reason that you found? Well, it's the cyclicity of demand for petroleum engineers and the huge number of layoffs that we have. It's really a problem that we've had for a long time. When demand drops and when crude oil prices drop, people cut their expenses. A lot of oil companies, major expenses, and particularly service companies, some of those are people. We have shown a huge ability to cut back on the number of employees and lay people off time and time again with increased productivity and sort of the number of engineers it takes to drill a given well to produce 100 wells or 1,000 wells. Our willingness to fire people is just caught, I think it's catching up with us. I remember people asking me, why is it that employees are willing to quit and go to another company so readily? Don't they show any loyalty? When in fact oil companies have not shown that same loyalty to the employees in many cases. They were very eager to, not eager, they were very willing to do what they needed to do, cut costs, and that included cutting back on people. So we've had a long period now of relatively soft oil prices and very soft gas prices and the demand for people continues to drop. So we've shown that and because petroleum engineers are committed to sort of one industry, we're particularly exposed there. If you were a mechanical engineer, chemical engineer, you would have options if one industry fell off. You know, electrical engineers used to, the electric power transmission and power generation people used to hire a lot of electrical engineers, but that industry has hired fewer and fewer electrical engineers. But double-E majors have been able to go and do something else in the computational world and other things have grown and expanded for them. So as a result, double-E has grown as a major and people still have options when one industry diminishes. We only have one industry and as every time we have a downturn, the employment prospects drop and the enrollments in schools drops. We're seeing that now all across enrollment in the U.S. It's way down. You know, in your paper you talk about cautionary tales from other engineering sectors. You just kind of you kind of teased that right there. But you single out mining engineering programs and I think with an emphasis on coal mining engineering programs and you found 14 schools worldwide in your research offering mining engineering degrees. Under undergrad enrollment in these schools was less than 500 and that was back in 2014 and only 200 graduates annually. So can you tell me why these are relevant stats to a petroleum engineer? Right. Well, of course, mining engineer used to be much, much larger and mining engineering at one point was more or less tied with petroleum engineering as the highest paying engineering graduates. Mining is another is very analogous to what petroleum engineers do. They are pretty much committed to one industry. Although it doesn't matter whether you're mining tin or coal or diamonds, they do more or less the same kind of extractive industries that we are in. They also tie to geological understanding. There's a lot of schools where there are mining degrees actually have petroleum degrees, whether it's in Leoben in Austria or Colorado School of Mines, RALA. So these were very similar to us and now while the mining industry has never been quite as large, the fact is mining itself has not declined in volumes. Mining, we mine more product out of the ground than we ever have in history. But we need less people to do that. There's only a handful of mining products whose prices are going up, chromium and some of the rare earth minerals, but most of the rest of them, the product prices remain soft and the emphasis is on productivity and they need fewer and fewer engineers to do the same work. They use a lot of high tech stuff in mining. There are automated drilling rigs. They invented geostatistics. I think Rio Tinto gets brought up in this industry a lot. So for the people that don't know, that's the Australian mining magnet and in terms of automation, very few industrial companies come close to what Rio Tinto has done. That was JPT's Trent Jacobs interviewing 2016 SPE President Nathan Meehan. Now we join SPE's Jason Notouris as he talks to Yogashree Pradhan, a reservoir engineer for Endeavor Energy Resources. They discuss how to market yourself and grow your career and she shows tips and tricks to grow your network. I think one of the places you've been very successful in doing that is LinkedIn and that's one of the big reasons we wanted to talk to you was about building your own brand online and I think you've done a remarkable job positioning yourself as a reliable connection and it's something, if you have any tips or advice that you could share with the listeners about strategy, did you have any from day one? Do you continue to evolve the strategy? How did you get into LinkedIn? It's interesting that you asked that. I wanted to approach this where I didn't want to prescribe on what people should do because I think people should be comfortable with the strategy that they take. So I want to go ahead and start with my own experiences. I go back to my first mentor. One of the first things he suggested me to do before my spring internship in high school was to get a LinkedIn profile and learn to build my network. Then I got the opportunity to go to SPE events in the Gulf Coast section and attend a couple conferences and short courses. So someone who's a senior in high school going into these short courses and never have taken a college class in petroleum engineering before, I was way in over my head. But the good thing was is that I was able to meet many professionals to keep in touch with on LinkedIn. I asked a lot of questions to help me get some context in these technical events. I kept that practice in university and afterwards and I continued to keep in touch with people. Maintaining those relationships ended up having the mentors that I had introduced me to other professionals in the industry. I also learned from other oil and gas professionals and other career development events in university on how to build my brand. Joining groups that I like, following industry experts and reading their posts and then sharing some of my interests on LinkedIn were some of the things that worked for me. So it's a combination of the experience of meeting with people on LinkedIn, going to SPE events, maintaining relationships and actively searching learning material that helped me. That's a really good breakdown. I also like when professionals are sharing their articles, you find on LinkedIn people are a little bit more open. I don't know about you, I get probably a solid five to ten connection requests a day and I feel bad. And this is advice that I actually got from people on LinkedIn. Make sure you include that personal note so they know where they met you, whether it was at a training seminar or if it was at a luncheon or a conference. And so I think if you're looking to connect with people on LinkedIn, that's just one of my personal tips. Is there something that you've seen or you've come across that you've kind of run into when it comes to connecting with someone that you want to share? Well, Jason, you hit the main points where whenever you do make a LinkedIn request, it's very important to make sure you provide that personal note or at least provide a reminder that you've met that connection or you've met that person at a conference or an event. Or if it's an article someone's posted and that you haven't met before, I mean, I still think you can go ahead and send a connection request, but make sure to add a note addressing that intention of where that connection request came from. That perhaps you can learn a lot from that person who has shared that article or perhaps you have a question about a paper that they've written and you wanted to get more context of that SP paper or the article that they recently published. But making sure of why you're intending to connect with that person, I also agree that's important. So Yogeshree, do you find yourself branding yourself differently online versus in person? So let's imagine a scenario. You're about to speak on a panel. Do you promote yourself on LinkedIn before, after, during? How does that message differ from the language and the verbiage you'll be using to speak at the event? What changes do you usually implement? I try to be consistent whether if I'm online or in person. It's a privilege to get invited to speak on panels. If it's a conference or if it's a panel where I'll be meeting people that I've not met in a while, I do post on LinkedIn before the event. If I haven't gotten the chance to catch up with people that I've connected with on LinkedIn, I post after as well. I try to sound conversational on LinkedIn and during a panel. And of course, I'll have to add more explanation or address a larger audience on social media than during a live event. It also depends on the type of event. Most events I've had the privilege being on a panel for is for university students sharing my story on networking and how to get internships. The content and therefore the language would be different compared to when I'm on a technical panel. Do you want to add that work experience ranges of the audience is much larger when you're on a technical panel? Yeah, and I think that's a smart approach to take. Almost altering the language to your audience versus maybe the platform as much. So routines are important for many of us. I personally find them to be pretty big time savers. Walk us through one of your favorite routines and how it kind of helps you set up your procedure and how you're going to operate. For communications, I have a couple of routines. One for in person and one for online communication. So I'll start with in person. If it's someone I know, I start with a request or comment that I need some help or I need some guidance. I also mentioned that I would like to bounce ideas or seek someone's input. At the end of the conversation, I summarize what the resolve is or if I gave myself homework to do, I'll set those action items for myself. If it's someone I don't know, I'd make the introduction and start with a question based on a talk that person gave or if we have a mutual connection. I'm an active listener where if I'm explaining something new, I make sure to regurgitate the response to make sure I understood the answer. I make sure to follow the standard networking protocol, business cards and follow communication. I personally need to keep up with my email follow up, but that's where the LinkedIn connection request comes in handy. If it's an email, whether if I met them in person or before or not, I start with why I'm emailing to keep myself focused on the message. I also make it clear that I would like feedback, input or response from the communication. And if it's someone I don't know from the email, I make sure to introduce myself and give context of how I got their email address or remind them which event that we met at. And has this approach changed over time at all? I mean, I know time's kind of relative, but in between three years ago versus last year versus even three months ago, have you adapted along the way? I have adapted quite a bit. I have learned how to adapt to different ways. I with different work experiences and communication styles, I learned how to adapt to different or to different forms of communication, whether if it's online or whether fits in person or on LinkedIn. And I have to learn how to picture myself in the shoes of the recipient. Like what information do they know? What do they not know? High school to university. The audience is, of course, broader because students, faculty and course recruiters, they all come from Houston. And finally, I got checkpoints in every internship and full time job like I talked about before. They there were all different environments, different locations, different communication styles. So I learned by experience when people sought more clarification, whether it's in person or whether it's your email. And I also learned how to seek clarification if I didn't understand something at firsthand. So you're saying checkpoints, clarification, and walking in someone else's shoes. See, I can regurgitate too, and make sure that I use one of your tips from earlier in making sure that you're responding with what the people are saying. You're right on. Yeah. Yeah. SPE is proud to offer a mentoring program for both mentors and mentees. E-mentoring is a distance mentoring program that gives members a way to contribute to the E&P industry by sharing industry insights and practical career advice with young professionals, or by helping university students with academic and career direction.

For our next discussion, JPT's Trent Jacobs talks to petroleum geoscience innovator Andrew Pepper about his take on how unconventional reservoir evaluation can be improved. So we got you in here today because you recently published some interesting work on the subject of fluid saturation. And one of your papers in the title said, fluid saturation isn't what it used to be. And what you're talking about is tight mudstones or shale. This paper that I'm talking about that I wanted to dig into was presented at the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference in Denver. That's ERTEC 196 for you folks who want to go onto one petro. One of your coauthors was with Anna Darko, and it was a really interesting paper. Your work addresses the issue of recovery factors. And so I wanted to kick off with a question about that. Since I came into this business, it became clear to me that recovery factors have been a subject of mystery for the shale sector. We often hear figures like five or 10% of the oil in place is being recovered from a horizontal well. But then there's this big question, what is really being drained? Is that 5% from a big box or is that 5% from a little box? Why has this issue been such a challenge? I think really the short answer is that the mobile oil in place that we appreciate is being overestimated and it's wrong in many cases. And I'm talking about organic-rich reservoirs. So the kind of core evaluation techniques that we've been using in the conventionals have been, through necessity, very rapidly adapted from previously shale gas analysis and also in many cases just simply ported from the conventional world and adapted as best as possible. You're talking about core analysis to some large extent? Yeah, core analysis methodologies. I'm lucky enough to have a unique perspective in being able to look back to the 80s in the lab, was doing some of the work that I think is relevant to this subject. And so I think in that sort of rush to try to understand this new phenomenon, we kind of forgot some of the principles that perhaps would have been commonplace to people who studied source rocks for the conventional petroleum system back in the 80s and 90s. And so what I've been doing is drawing on that understanding. And I think all the major companies, BP, where I was, Shell and Exxon did formative work in this area of understanding the sorbed hydrocarbons. And that's really a key to the argument. Can you touch on that and talk about the sorbed hydrocarbon? Absolutely, yeah. In a water-wet-pore system, in the mineral matrix system, there are some cartoons in the Eartek paper to try and explain this. Then the petroleum exists as a phase and it's separated from the water phase by the interfacial tension around that phase boundary between the two fluids. When we introduce organic-rich material, which is where the molecules are actually generated in the first place in the organic matrix, then there's really two processes. One is absorption, which is essentially the dissolution of molecules within this complex framework. So you can think of molecules trapped in molecular cages within this complex structure of kerogen. And then the other part of it is perhaps a little bit better under-appreciated, which is absorption, which is the molecules that adhere to the surface of the true-pore system. So together, these things, we're not smart enough, I don't think, right now to understand how to separate those two phenomena. But together, it basically means that there's an amount of petroleum molecules in an organic-rich rock that are part of the solid phase of that organic matter. So they shouldn't be counted as fluid molecules. And given the term saturation, because the term saturation, in my view, should be reserved for the mobile hydrocarbons and how they compete with the water phase for production. So in a nutshell, you're really challenging even the definition of the original oil in place here, you know, that we're lumping in oil that will never come out of the ground with oil that will. Yeah, and the problem we have is that the laboratory techniques we have, they don't differentiate this. So solvents do not care whether they're extracting these molecules from the organic framework or whether they're producing a, you know, they're recovering a fluid phase that's present in the rock. Obviously, if we have an organic-lean rock, say the middle back end or perhaps some of the sandy, silty beds in the bone spring that are just sort of tight, conventional reservoirs, then the sorption process, because there's very little organic matter there, is not an issue. So I'm not trying to say every single shale or unconventional reservoir is a problem. But the more organic rigs to reservoir is, the more we need to think about the sorption process and make this subtraction from the total solvent extractable oil in place or the paralyzable or retort oil in place. All of these measures, they just give us a bulk number of molecules and then we have to partition them into which molecules belong in the solid phase and are not mobile and which belong in the fluid phase and are part of the mobile fluid system. Right, and it's interesting, you mentioned the bone spring, which is one of the popular targets out in the Permian. I just saw a gun barrel stratigraphic completion kind of a landing zone targets from one of the big operators out there and it was clear just to look at their gun barrel that they had a different completion style. It was more geometric for the bone spring, which you can get away with as what you're kind of saying versus the Wolf Camp A, which is much tighter. And they had a much more customized approach to the target zones or the landing zones for those wells. So that may speak to what you're talking about. But what this comes down to is something that we kind of touched on earlier, which is recovery factors. And what you're arguing in your Urtech paper is that recovery factors may actually be higher than we think. So does that suggest that the reservoir matrix is not really a huge contributor to production? And one reason why I ask that is because I've heard experts bandy this idea about that they think that the rock matrix is actually only producing into the well bore just a few inches from the face of the fracture. Does your work support that concept, that idea? Yeah, so if our estimates of absolute rock permeability are about right, then yes, there should be very little drawdown of the virgin matrix pour system, quite close to the induced natural fractures. I mean, this is really not my field, but I hear some workers think that the frac process itself disturbs the grain boundaries, even though it doesn't necessarily create a discrete fracture away from the induced fracture system. Somehow you're kind of rubble-izing or altering the permeability at the grain contacts of the surrounding material. So in a sense, that makes sense in terms of inducing a permeability that will allow you to drain deeper into the rock matrix than it would be if you're just relying on the virgin permeability itself of the host rock. Follow up question here, does that bleed into this idea of fracture complexity because you're getting more surface area and that's, and when I say fracture face, I'm meaning the actual rock that's exposed to the matrix and to the open system where the prop impact is to allow flow to happen. And so the more of that you create because you're not gonna get this oil to travel very far out of the rock, that's what's becoming critical to develop with your fracs. As I say, not my field, but it is my belief, yes, that the fracs are doing in a sense a much better job than we ever imagined. And for those of us that worked on source rocks back in the early 80s and 90s, on how the oil gets out on a geological time scale, it's just amazing. That was JPT's Trent Jacobs talking with petroleum geoscience innovator, Andrew Pepper. To hear more about this topic, visit the SPE podcast. Now we dive into one of the highlights from the 2020 hydraulic fracturing technology conference with Mike Rainbow, an experienced completions engineer and a senior technical advisor for Abra controls. He gives us some insights on major advances around the so-called parent-child issues that all US shell producers face. You were an author on one of these update papers with Endeavor, right? And which is a shell producer in the Permian Basin. Yes, the lead author was Yvonne Schurz and the paper number is 199686. And what we did two years ago is we had a 22 well observation monitoring project, and we took those learnings and used that to plan for fracture mitigation in this new project. And Endeavor was very successful doing that. As far as preloading, that is beginning to achieve some popularity. Of course, the concerns I'm hearing from operators is the expense of doing it and the amount of, the success they're having in dampening or subduing FDIs. You can't stop them, but you can slow them down and reduce their overall impact. Right, and FDIs were talking about fracture driven interactions. That's sort of the new technical term for what is colloquially known as frac hits. But some people just call it fracture interference. But tell me a little bit more about just sort of the, how you see how preloads work. Cause I sort of, I think we've all had to come up with like a mental image of how preloading works. But early when operators started coming out about it, they were saying that we were actually really unable to model some of this sometimes in commercial models because it is so unique. So what do you think, why do you think preloading works? And is that even like the right term, calling it preloading? Is that the one that's gonna stick? I guess there's actually a couple of different ways you can preload, which means that you inject a certain amount of fluid into your well pre-frac. And then there's the one that a company called Abraxis is using, which is injection on demand in which they do preloading. And then they have pumps rigged up to where they can continue the injection when they see a pressure inflection occur in the offsetting well. The third type is continuous injection. And I actually have a client that did a side by side comparison of preloading versus continuous injection to see which technique was the most effective. And the goal of preloading and continuous injection, and really it's one to protect the wellbore, the existing wellbore from sand influx or outright casing damage like you see in SP paper, 191712. The other thing is they're trying to protect the existing assets, reserves and production rate. And number three, and this one is getting more and more popular, is using the preloading or the continuous injection to enhance the effectiveness of the stimulation in the new well. And I have seen cases where the new well is performing better preloading than it did without it. In fact, 191712, that was its main point was they were using it to get enhanced production from the new wells. Man, I have a lot of questions about preloading. And yes, I've seen actually with my own eyes, the active defense or what you're calling the on demand preloading from Abraxis. And it's just, it's super, you know, it's actually super frustrating to be on the surface at a completion site when you're really always thinking about what's happening down two miles below. But what, so, but let's open that up. I mean, why is this working? Is it creating a pressure shield? Are we talking about stress changes, poor pressure changes? How does the just putting water down really, really mitigate or help keep fractures in the productive zone that operators are really trying to target? This technique, and I was in a course yesterday with Ali Donashi and he's pointing out this, these preloads and injections really work with wells that have mostly liquid rich reservoirs like oil and water with very little gas because liquids are less compressible, much less compressible than gas is. And what happens when you preload or inject is that you're actually, Chevron actually calls it pushing back where you're, you have an incompressible fluid in there and you're putting enough resistance so that migrating fluids from the new well run into resistance and cannot overcome what you're pumping into the old well. And that's the basis of the techniques. You're just basically fighting water with water as the Abraxas article said, or you're making something that it's more difficult for the invading fluids to reach your old well or invade their fracture systems. I wanna talk about the cost because this is sort of, when you talk to new adopters, that's one of like the first things they say is they talk about trying to like, well, okay, we're starting here, but we wanna sort of bring things down. So what are the cost drivers? What are the things that companies who have been doing this for one to two to three years? What have they learned on how to sort of scale this? Well, let's talk about the easy one first and that's preventing sand influx into wells. This is pretty popular in the Bakken Reservoir and also places like the Eagleford where it's not uncommon to have to do a 250 to $300,000 clean out after new well frac ops. And so if you can get as high as half a million. You can, you can, and that's with no well bore damage like stuck tubing or something else. So the cost potential of not having to do a cost clean out is well worth the preloading and preventing that. In fact, that's why Abraxas is doing their injections just strictly to prevent sand influx. Sometimes they see a little bump in production too, but the 350,000, as you said, $500,000 clean out jobs are prohibitively expensive. Yeah, and so, but what is the water total usage? Cause you know, one of the things that made Abraxas a little bit special in this regard was they had their own produced water system on that lease. And so they actually were able to control water costs very much, but what have you seen in terms of water usage and just in, you know, even ballpark or general terms or people starting high and then going down low to reduce costs and see if they can still get these same sort of protection. Oh, that's a great question. Here in SB 191 712, the technique was this. First order offset well received 20,000 barrel preload. The second order offset well received 10,000 barrel load. I'm working with operators right now that typically 30 to 50,000 barrels per well. And in the case, in the one case of continuous injection that I know of, we pumped 170,000 barrels of water into that from about three weeks prior to the beginning of frac ops until the end of frac ops. And we did that in accordance with the Huntington Beach, California technique in which you pump it low and slow. And every 10,000 barrels, you shut down and measure ISIP. We saw a beautiful increase in ISIPs with time. And the technique was quite successful. Yeah, you mentioned the Huntington Beach. That was a workshop. Why was it now two years ago? A fracture driven interaction mitigation workshop over there in California. And I wasn't there, but everybody that was always always brings it up, but I'll do the shameless plug. I mean, that's why being in these rooms and being a part of the SBE and a part of the discussion is so important for people. If you're engaged anywhere in the world, whether it's China, Argentina, or the US or Canada, or Russia in hydraulic fracturing, being in these dialogue sessions is something that could actually shorten your learning curve by years. Maybe not 10 years, but maybe two or three. And so can you just comment on that, on how you've reflecting on what you saw at the conference the other week? You know, are people catching onto these things pretty steadily and learning from each other? How is that knowledge transfer working? Oh, that's a great comment. Just briefly at Huntington Beach, one of the things, two things that they stressed was that poor cement around your pipe can really reduce the number of clusters that you form during the stages. The other thing they mentioned was extreme limited entry perforating. And shortly after that, I noticed operators were sort of reluctant to consider the limited entry perforating, but at the HTFC this time, I ran into a number of operators that they are migrating towards the limited entry technique with ever shorter cluster spacing to improve cluster efficiency, to improve fluid distribution. And this tremendously"

Peter, Eddie, and Luis, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you very much, Carlos. Thank you for taking the time. We look forward to seeing you in two or three weeks. So let's get started. We have some questions lined up. So let's get started with Peter. Will you share with us what are the current major trends in the wind intervention industry in terms of technology, scope of work, areas of work? Thanks, Carlos, for the question. And once again, thank you for having me today. I think when you're looking at the agenda of the SPE Eye Coding Transformation Conference and Exhibition, you get a pretty good idea of what are the main preoccupations of our industry today. You will see that there is, of course, a lot of focus being placed on how to deal with adverse downfall conditions. A good example would be how to go and intervene in extended reach wells or multilateral completions, completions that are more and more complex. There is also how to deal with always higher levels of pressure, of temperature, and now more and more going into very corrosive environments, whether we're talking about high levels of H2S or CO2. And of course, our industry over the past few years has introduced a number of new technologies, whether they're hardware or chemically related. There is also another big front, which is efficiency, or better said, the search for efficiency. I think well intervention is the same as the rest of the oil and gas industry. There is always more push for efficiency. And this is where we expect all of us to see a lot of technology advancements, whether on the hardware side of things, or even I should say on the digital side, certainly more today than before, achievements that are going to bring our wet industry to the next level. And there are two things that over the past few years have come and gone, but they are back and I think are very important for our wet intervention industry. The very first one is a big focus on offshore. So that's definitely a big area of growth currently under all its forms, whether you're talking about operations on platforms, on vessels, light wet interventions, subsea interventions. And a lot has to do with how to enable this, I would say this new frontier, while keeping a high level of efficiency, which often is going to make or break a project. And also because those operations are certainly some of the most complex and the riskiest when you think about them, but with a high payoff. And last but not least, a big focus for our industry and where we see a lot of technologies being implemented is for the sake of abandonment. When integrity and abandonment, whether we're talking about Zonal or the final abandonment of the well, you know, when you look at the number of wells we have around the globe nowadays, it's give or take about 2 million out of those. Out of those about 66% of them are 10 years and more, which begs the question, when and how are we going to deal with those wells? Whether this is to abandon them in the safest and the most efficient way, or even extend their producing life to try to push forward when we're going to see that last drop of oil that we will be able to extract from the ground. So all those areas are extremely important to our industry. There is a lot of focus and we will see at the conference a lot of discussion around those different areas. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you for your answer, Pierre. Will you say, is there anything you'd like to add in this perspective? Quickly. Absolutely. I agree with Pierre. If you look at the current landscape of our industry, you can see that efficiency is a big theme. You can see how footprint is a big theme. You can see that they're moving to offshore and how we are shifting gears to internalize and understand that the commissioning of wells is going to be extremely relevant in the near future. Then you can definitely see that these are the main trends in the industry and you will see that reflected in the program of the conference as well. 100%. Any, I think you were going to add something. Any? Carlos, good morning. Yes, I agree with the comments made by Carlos and Pierre. I'd also like to add that some of the things that we're seeing, especially in the unconventionals, the shale plays around the world, are interventions in low pressure wells where potentially refrax can be done. We all know that some of the best production can be had from existing assets. I think what we're seeing is in the perceived current market of capital discipline by the major operators to limit drilling and potentially exploit more of their trap production, intervention then becomes highly important for assets, for existing assets. Keep in mind that all of these existing assets already have infrastructure in place. So your pipelines, your takeaway are already embedded into their program. And some of the things we're seeing by major operators around the world in these unconventionals are more dollars being put at intervention budgets and actual programs rather than so more proactive rather than reactive, which I think is going to push the envelope on technology. You're already starting to see lots of new technologies around methods of intervention for wells that need to be cleaned out, intervened, and then potentially refrax, specifically for vintage wells five or 10 years old. The new frac technology that we see today can be adapted to those wells. And then we see that many of these operators around the world in these unconventionals are seeing production gains from existing assets. Yeah, thank you. That's, I believe that's going to be beautiful things about what I mentioned. It allows operators to get relatively quick production rather than drilling in a cost-effective manner. So I'll stick with you, Eddie, on the following question. Can you share with us, Mason, there's a well-sought production decline at the curve, in the production decline curve that requires intervention. The use of colloidal gas apron CGA fruits results in affecting well intervention and cleanouts. So from your perspective, how do operators designate candidate wells for CGA applications? Great question. So there are lots of factors in play, including tapping the reservoir engineering team to identify candidate wells that are able to be put into a program for intervention with colloidal gas apron fluids or structuralized microphones. Why is that important? That technology specifically has allowed now for intervention of wells that otherwise would not circulate, meaning they're all on artificial lift. There's no bottom hole pressure. And so anytime in the past years when they were intervened, you're literally just pumping field water into the well, hoping that you can agitate some of that debris and remove it or drill through bridges that are impairing production. And in some cases, even trying to tag dissolvable plugs that were never dissolved. And so with the colloidal gas apron fluid technology that is now out on the market, what you're seeing is you're seeing operators use that technology to get the entire lateral of that well cleaned out and then prepared potentially for a refract liner. In some cases, after drilling out the dissolvable plugs, they see a significant increase in production. And so no refract is technically required after that. And then lastly, you know, some of the things that you see, especially in some of the really depleted basins where you have no bottom hole pressure, some of these wells are on vacuum, you're able to clean out wells that have been fracked hit from adjoining fields. So there's a whole host of different reasons why these operators would do it. But the ability to circulate a well that otherwise wouldn't circulate means that you are able to get all the way to the toe that well and then put in place the technologies around refract or around new artificial lift. It could be ESP technology that allows you to remove more of that trap production. Great. Thank you. Following up on that, Ryan, so obviously as far as the CGA fluids study, are there any of our mineral concerns and our benefits to utilizing them? Can they be reused or recycled on subsequent wells? Yeah, great question. Actually, there's, you know, there's actually a really strong ESG statement around the use of CGA fluids. And what do I mean by that? If you take the methods that were being utilized in prior years, and we go back to the comment I made about pumping field water to try to circulate a depleted well, that takes a lot of trucks. In some cases, that field water can be piped to location, but in many cases, and in many basins around the world, that means that you have an endless line of trucks that are constantly coming and going from location. With CGA fluids, the intent is to get the well at balance, so modulate the density of the fluid to match the hydrostatic of the wells so that you can circulate. So it takes a lot less water to circulate these wells. And on top of that, CGA fluids for the most part are recyclable, meaning that because they're re-circuit and you're constantly treating them and filtering them, as the operator moves to adjoining wells, that fluid can be moved and potentially used three or four times as a base fluid to keep costs down. In terms of disposal of the fluid, it is a biopolymer fluid, meaning that all of the contents and chemicals that are used in these fluids are environment friendly. And the industry standard now is to clean the fluid up and then just inject it into saltwater disposal wells. So a big ESG gain can be made on CGA fluids from limiting the use of trucks to location and limiting the amount of water that you put on the reservoir that then has to be produced back, and then taking off well site either by pipe or by vac trucks. That's great. That's fantastic. And you look at it from, you know, reducing the amount of logistics around fluids and the overall cost of the overhead cost of the operation. That's a fusion package. Thank you, Larry. So I'll go to the next question. Louise, can you share with us why is well-invention more relevant than ever to help address the challenges of energy transition? Hey, thanks. Thanks for the question, Carlos. I like it. I like this question. It's interesting. And I'll try and be as direct as possible. I think that, put simply, intervention barrels are the cheapest, the fastest, and the more carbon friendly barrels are going to find in the industry. And what do I mean by that? You know, cheapest just meaning lowest cost. If you look at the average intervention cost in the last few years for an onshore intervention, it's around $6 per barrel. If you look at an offshore, it goes up to about $11 per barrel. Compare that with a full drilling barrel, for example, and you get very, very forward mathematics there. The fastest, I mean, we're doing interventions faster now. Compare it comparing to, you know, 15 years ago, we're doing things probably 50 to 40% faster than we used to. And actually, we're being more successful. The success level of interventions today is the rate is higher than it was years ago. So we're getting better at this as we build, you know, a track record of intervention in the industry. And so we apply what we know to mature assets more. And of course, you know, the carbon friendly side, intervention barrels, like I said, are their lowest carbon footprint barrels, meaning intervention, especially on the light side, typically, you know, if you look at slick line, wireline, cold tubing, the lighter deployment methods, their carbon footprint is orders of magnitude smaller than a rig, than a workover rig, and orders of magnitude smaller than drilling rigs. So huge advantage to the industry. The other side of it is that, you know, operators in an industry do agree that in order to get through this current energy transition journey, you know, there's not a single source of energy here that's going to be the silver bullet, right? It's going to be a diverse mix of energies. And that includes, you know, new energies like hydrogen or maybe, you know, the carbon capture applications, geothermal, but also oil and gas. And a lot of those oil and gas resources will come from mature fields, kind of going back to Eddie's point earlier. So we think intervention, it's going to play a key role as it's one of the main ways to keep mature fields going. And it's one of the most cost effective ways to increase production from wells that have been typically thought as either risky or high cost, for example, like offshore, just to touch back on Pierre's point as well. So to kind of close that out, if you think of the industry and then we wrap together, you know, trends, right now, the smaller footprint applications, smaller footprint techniques, a big thing in our industry right now, just so we can reduce emissions, so simpler, less weight, less people, faster, less emissions, all this technology advances and all these deployment methods and new things that were coming in, new trends, they translate into a more efficient and less carbon intensity industry that will be key to getting our, not only our industry, but our world through the energy position and into the next stage. Thank you. Thank you, Luis. Can I remind her to the audience, feel free to ask any questions. We do have one question from the audience from LinkedIn by Aaron Baxter. What technology brings the most value in accessing wells that need to be recompleted, perhaps wells that are high in H2S, high temperature or depleted? Luis, you want to take that question? So, yeah, sure. It really depends. The answer typically is it depends. So it's so in this case, it really depends on what level of recompletion you want to achieve and the concept of the world of recompletion itself. You know, some people see, see, recompletion as, for example, just perforating a well higher up in a different zone to access a bypassed resource. You know, in that case, something that leverages a light deployment method, like perhaps E-Line, would be the fastest application and the one that might bring more value. And the one can get you to do that through tubing if that is the application and if that is actually there. Now, if you're looking at recompletion as some others catalog it as, for example, changing the entire tubular array inside the well or the completion itself, then you're looking into hydraulic workovers, for example, that can do it really fast and are modular and easier to move in or even work over it. Depending on how deep the wells are and the environment that you're working at. So a little bit of detail, but it depends on really what the situation is. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Luis. Pierre, Eddie, would you like to add anything on that? Yeah, that's true that we could take it from quite different angles. As Luis mentioned, it really depends on what you're aiming at. So, I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. Yeah, that's true that we could take it from quite different angles. As Luis mentioned, it really depends on what you're aiming at and how you're looking at it. I think one additional point that I would add is as we are getting into the business of trying to extend the producing life of assets as the ways that Luis was alluding to in terms of participating in that energy transition or we should say maybe transformations. We realize that those interventions that we have are getting more and more complex. And even when you go into such thing as recompleasion or even making, as Eddie was mentioning, more efficient clean outs so that we get a better production from the wells. There is a key piece also that plays and that is the power of the data. It's one particular technology block that maybe in the earlier times of well intervention was not a big part of the focus. But as we're going into those operations nowadays, we realize that the only way that one would have to combine different services, different tools, being able to be agile, maybe having a smaller footprint, a smaller personal board, then you need to have access to data. And in some cases to the downfall data in real time. And this is actually a key area of developments that we see we have a lot being presented on the topic during the conference. Simply because this is certainly the link that allows you bringing different tools and different services together so that you can now envision some recompleasion workflows or services that you simply didn't think of in the past because you didn't have that capability of making an assessment and having the possibility to control what's happening down the hole and to deliver certainly something much more efficient. It's difficult and much more risky with a better level of control of what you're delivering, whether this is to pump, to perforate, maybe to cut and to actuate part of the downhole completion. So I wouldn't neglect this element of the downhole data, which is in addition and a very good complement to the different means that Luis was talking about. Thank you. Thank you. Eddie, you care to add anything before we move on to the next question? Yeah, absolutely. I'd like to segue into Pierre's comment about downhole data. And I would say that one of the things that we're seeing in the intervention space is a lot of live data and automation is now available on work over rigs and coil units, which are the primary method of intervening wells. And what does the live data do in terms of the ability to perform these interventions better? It allows for collaboration between experts that lie within the operator that potentially that service company is working for, but also ties together multiple service companies that are on location, which is something that in drilling has been happening for years. But we're starting to see now that live data streams and live data decision making is impactful in terms of how much time over the well you are with that intervention, but also allowing for knowledge share from multiple service companies and the operator to make better decisions and to become more efficient. So I would say that with the advent of downhole data now available in many tools for intervention, but also the addition to the surface data that is now being streamed live, it's a great combination. Thank you. Thank you, Eddie. Let's move on to the next question. Let's go back to Pierre. Let's go back to Pierre. What is the well innovation industry doing today to address these last shortcomings? And I'm going to turn in a question from the audience here from Ajay Seth, who says, you know, what role new collaboration and partnerships play in adopting and implementing new well-invention technologies? Are there any notable test sources in this? Well, it'll be short on time, so I got to ask Pierre to try to, you know, choose straight. No, that's an excellent question. Certainly one of the most important questions to be asked around well intervention. I'm going to keep it very brief. I think when you look at the topic of the success rate of well interventions, which arguably is certainly stagnating a little bit nowadays, some people say 60, 65%. There are a number of different headwinds. One of them is one we've talked about just before, access to data, the utilization of data, making it play to your advantage. There is another one, which is certainly a lack of alignment of what I would say are outcomes or maybe the goals or the objectives of an intervention. And what we see more and more nowadays are what I would call alliances in between different service companies and operators so that those objectives and especially the overachieving objective of an operation intervention, which is to improve the production, is going to be met and exceeded. And those alliances are usually in between service companies that provide very specific targeted type of products to address very customized sets of challenges. Some others that plays integrator and with an operator that is going to help prioritize and very often have an objective that is going to be performance based for the entire alliance. And I think it goes a long way because we realize that through those projects, usually you get a better continuous improvement and intervention and intervention. You are in fact raising the rate of success that you have during interventions because it's a much more integrated approach and much more sustainable as well. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you, Peter. So let me go back to Luis. Luis, we have a question from the audience from my Suresh Singh. He is asking about how people collaborate on some proactive intervention technologies for viral gain and how to best use them. And I want to add also because we're almost there. You know, if you can then give them a little bit of an insight, how can they benefit from going to the conference on such questions, right? What would they get? So 30 seconds for two questions. Yeah, you can go one minute. I'll give you one minute. We can do this. We can do this. Thanks, Carlos, and thanks for the question. I'll keep it simple again. Proactive intervention for production increase. I'll take this from a macro level and look at and just say that make use of the technology that you have available in 2024, right? Make use of what you know or what you can know from your wallets, from your equipment, understanding your temperatures, your pressures, understanding your flows, see how they vary in time, partner with someone that can actually get the data and get the insights out of that, get the analytics out of that. And then once you have a better understanding of your field, then put together a program, very simple program for what I would call proactive intervention is just go and check out your wells and do some interventions with the client and get some more data from them on the ones that you cannot get straight data from. That will give you much more information on your well and what's going on and what's coming down the pipeline and how to prepare for it than a lot of other things and then just try to shoot things in the dark. That would be my recommendation on the surveillance side is what I call it as a surveillance. On ICOTA, Carlos, to close into your second question. Look, ICOTA and ESPE both are amazing organizations. These organizations are big, they're robust. They have a lot of internal support from volunteers. So use them to your advantage. It doesn't matter if you are the discipline that you're in or the level of experience that you have. ESPE and ICOTA have something that probably adjusts to your current situation, your current position. And what I'm saying is, if you're just starting out, for example, there's many training sessions. I know Carlos, for example, you're giving a training session right before the intervention conference on March 19th. There's training sessions for people that are starting out in the industry. If you want to know more about what's going on and have a little bit of a widespread view, then you can just attend and put your ear on the ground on what the industry is doing through the conference or through one of the many events that ICOTA has through a year. Or if you're experienced and you just want to share your experience and your knowledge, then you can participate by presenting a paper and presenting articles. And this can be, it doesn't matter if you're a well intervention professional, a production enhancement professional, if you're in the CCUS space or new energies, or if you're in the abandoned space. So it's a very robust and widespread organization that can help professionals and people that want to enter the industry move forward and get a better insight. Sorry, I was trying to be as fast as possible. So I hope that was a comprehensive answer there, guys. No, thank you. You did very well, Luis. Thank you. That was rather fun. Thank you. We have time for one more question. And then we'll wrap it up. One more question from the audience. And Eddie, if you would like to take this one. It's coming from the SBE Energy Stream website by Surendra Ahmed Dabbat asking, are the geomechanical studies part of the pre-intervention planning? So that great question. And I wish I could give a positive answer on this. But the reality and the trends that at least that I'm seeing and speaking with other industry leaders around the intervention space is that there it is not very prevalent to do geomechanical studies as part of intervention planning. I think we're still in a time warp where we're being reactive rather than proactive. And so a lot of a lot of energy and resources are not yet put on the intervention space. I believe that especially if you're looking at land driven interventions, they're really more of a reaction around a well that is on a decline curve or completely stop producing. And so it is it is imperative that that will be put back online. And so they want to do these things quite quickly. I hope that the industry does go to a world where we are we're seeing the same type of reservoir engineering, the same type of production engineering and geomechanical engineering that you see potentially for the drilling side of assets. But I would also I know we're on a time crunch, but I would love to hear Piers comments around this because potentially the first place sometimes these things happen is in the in the offshore part of our business because there are there are there are better results potentially we have. But there are also larger budgets. So, Pierre, anything to that you see potentially on that side for the offshore part of our business? I'm going to try to be as quick as possible before I'm getting just eyes for this. But I think that you're correct. It's not prevalent. It's not prevailing. And that's that's that's a bit disappointing because and I go back to a comment that was made before and I will extend beyond offshore. What you realize the moment that you start introducing this notion of getting insights around and during your operations, once you get access to down hold data and you see what's happening during your intervention at the level of the well bore, especially because most of our interventions are for the sake of production enhancement. Of course, there is a big relationship to the reservoir. And of course, you realize that anything that has to do with maybe pumping a chemical shutting off his own enabling another zone has to do with the reservoir. And of course, it has to do with the geomechanical aspect of it. And I will just take one example. If you go through the literature and you go through different papers being published nowadays, any operation, any well interventions that would have to do with especially conformance and stimulation, more and more often you realize that as part of the planning job being done at the level of one well or four campaign or even for candidate identity. The geomechanical studies are actually a big part of it and becoming a big part of it. And it has to do with that previous questions that we got on the success rate of interventions. Yes, in the past, we saw a number of interventions that were fading and delivering the production enhancement because it was unknown or it had been unsuspected that there was a major fault in the data. Or unsuspected that there was a major fault or there was maybe natural fractures that were taking fluid and prevented the proper delivery of the intervention. So I think as we get access to down hold data, as we're using that more and more, we will have more integrated studies. And as we said, because interventions are getting more complex because we're trying to extend as much as possible what we can get out of those material fields. Those studies are going to become more comprehensive and I bet you that we're going to see a bigger part of the geomechanical studies as part of the intervention planning and design. Thank you. Thank you, Pierre. So as we know, this is a pretty neat upcoming ICODA SBE conference. So just to sum it up, to all of you, Eddie, Louise, and Pierre, can you share with the audience your final thoughts on industry trends, innovations, and technologies that they can expect to see my attending conference coming up in March? Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Carlos. I'll be super quick. So, come, I always say come to the conference, spend a couple days with the SBE team and the ICODA team so you can see the latest in industry. This will help understand how we're getting faster, how we're getting better at what we do as an industry as a whole. So come join us, make space for it, March 19th, the 20th, at least Friday, and you'll be hooked. There's a lot of things that we do that just really make production enhancement optimization better. And there's a perfect place to actually come check it all out. So just take your time and join us for it. Thank you. It's an open invite. Thank you. Eddie, just to wrap up, any thoughts? Yeah, I'll be brief. There's so many things that we could talk about in terms of. Yeah, there's so many things that we could talk about on the technology front. I'm bullish on the Refrac technology that's in our space currently. I think that there's a lot of gain around advancements in Refrac. I also like near-well border stimulation. And there are a lot of great technologies around that. And I would say that obviously we'd love to see you at the ICODA show coming up here next month. But also one of the growing workshops in our in our in SPE is the Refrac workshop that is now annual. A lot of great technology around that. And so I would say from the technologies and the impact, Carlos, the Refrac space is exciting because it really allows for that that production gain that a"
SPE President‚Äôs Podcast with Terry Palisch: ‚ÄúCreating Our Energy Future‚Äù‚ÄîThe Value of Publishing Technical Papers for Your Career - February 2024,"the world. This is SB talks to Adrian LeDros. Hey, Welcome to the S B podcast. I'm Trent Jacobs. Today we're talking with Adrian LeDros. Adrian, what's your title? I'm the I'm a VP and also the chief scientist for World War Placement and Charred data. Okay, there's a there's a lot to unpack here. I wanted to talk about, um, some of the things that you were talking about, including the oil and gas, the oil and gas, the engineering, surveying technology in general. But before we got on, you were telling me that you actually didn't start off in oil and gas. So you were a biomedical engineer. That's correct. Yes. I'm biomedical engineer. I started working with sensor signals processing that to extract useful information and then similar principles. I started working on systems and systems, getting them better to extract information, but forward world War Placement. Okay, great. So you know, another another person, another example of how you can take other areas of expertise and port them into the oil and gas industry. You actually got exposed in Calgary. You were saying you're you're your accent gives you away. So you're not from the U. S. You're from I'm from Argentina. Yes. So I learned my English via Calgary. I did masters there in electrical engineering. I was a pharmaceutical engineer. Um and then that's that's what when I transitioned to the oil and gas and the the war of World War survey. Okay, well, let's let's talk about that. Let's talk about World War surveying. Um you know, this is the technology that personally I have focused a lot of my energies over the years on completions technology sort of looking at that is like one of the big drivers of the unconventional revolution here in the world. So I think that investment and well, more surveying is something that I'm a little bit less exposed to through my reporting. So I was going to see maybe we could just start off even if it's for my own benefit, if not the listeners, you know what is well, more surveying? Um you know, how did it start? What's the evolution of that technology arena look like when the whole drilling for all started? We were doing vertical wells. There was no survey and you just drill a hole in the ground vertically or try to keep it vertically or try to keep it vertical. So we started to do it all. But then we started needing to deviate the wells to get to different formation because of different obstacles. And then we needed to know where we were drilling. And so through the use of different method, the first one were very primitive and then with the evolution of the transistor, the electronics, more sophisticated methods using well first mechanical methods with gyroscopes and magnetometers and then with the accelerometers and then spinning wheel gyroscopes, solid state magnetometers and solid state gyros so you can basically deviate the well and know where you're going. And you need that information to see that you reach the reservoir and also to see the place that you thought have oil really produced at the end of the day. So that's one of the things we see a lot of sort of cartoons of oil wells, you know, them kind of going into the layer cake and hitting that right target. But then you sit through enough technical sessions on this subject and you learn that like staying in the target zone is very difficult. And so some traditional technologies, you know, one of the things you know, measurement while drilling, I guess, would be sort of the bedrock, if you will, of this area. It has well documented challenges with the oil wells that are already in the bay in the formation. So can you talk about what are those challenges? Why Why, you know, the evolution of this technology has continued to be needed? Sure. Yes. So that measurement while drilling usually refers to the measurement of the orientation using magnetometers and accelerometers. So they measured their magnetic field on to determine the orientation and with the information from the magnetometer, we can measure the magnetic field. So that's not what we're going to be here. But that's fine. That's our audience is sort of the Petro nerd community. So feel free. You You can estimate the the the inclination and the orientation or the the asymptomatic. Um, but one of the issues is that the magnetometer will measure magnetic field regardless of the source. So you're not totally measuring the earth magnetic field that determine your North. You will measure the magnetic field. So you will not be able to measure any or deposit of anything that is down hole. In addition, the magnetic field is not something static and it has a normal is due to the to the the the crustal field and also is affected by magnetic solar storms and other things. So the references is not very stable and you have to model that with well, it is possible that you can measure the magnetic field. It's not as simple as just you run a sensor and you get your information clean. So you have to cancel all these other influencing factors out, you know, including solar flares and and the earth's own magnetic field, which isn't static. And so I imagine that's that's been a difficult process to do over the years. Yeah. And there are several companies, universities and, uh, it's also possible to well, to monitor this in real time and apply that to the to the field where you are drilling. But obviously these at cost and complexity and the procedures and sometimes there is even a delay. So in order to continue drilling, you need to know where you are, but you need to to do a correction based on what's going on. So that delays the process as well. And traditionally we're talking about, you know, you know, when I've been exposed to MWD and and serving, uh, and this may be a little outdated, but people talk about, you know, 90 ft measurement. So every 90 ft you drill, take a measurement and you may realize you're pointed up down a little bit too far. Then you have to correct. And then that's that's sort of been pointed to by drilling experts as one reason for, uh, you know, shales, highly undulated wells again, going back to those cartoons that we see in corporate slide decks, you see these nice straight wells, but in reality, they're they're they look like, you know, little wormholes are going up and down and and and that kind of torch, uh, tortuosity is not desired, right? So people are trying to get, uh, effectively stay in zone and then get straighter wells. Is that sort of what the prize for drillers is today? Yes, yes, it is. That's correct. Yeah, that's sometimes is known as a well board quality. And yes, when you have a data point, a survey every 90 ft, sometimes it looks straight. Sometimes it looks undulated, but that's many times depends on when you stop and take the survey. If you are rotating or sliding, obviously you have a an assembly that allow you to build a curve. So when you try to build a straight line is very difficult because that's a it's usually a bend assembly. Um, but yeah, until we we didn't get the technology that allow us to see the well boards with the high density of data. Right now it's possible to get surveys every one foot if you have the right technology. Um, so before it was just all assumptions and people, well, were associated this with the with possible problems with undulations, but they really didn't have the data to validate it. Uh, but now we can survey, well, the open hole either while drilling or post drilling with a jar or a magnetometer and then we can survey the casing as well and to see, um, how straight the well board was. And that's usually associated with, uh, uh, well, issues with the torque and drag. It may limit, um, your, uh, how far you can take the well because if you have, uh, if you have all these undulation, you can imagine that the frictions become very high and you cannot transfer the weight to the beat and continue the drilling. So, um, there are many benefits associated with the, with the straight trajectory. So straighter, a straighter well, uh, kind of, like you said, with less fric friction, you're, you're having fewer drilling dysfunctions and you're able to drill faster. Yes. And, and, and farther. And also when it comes to the time of running casing, you have less problems. If you have to install a, a way of a artificial, artificial leaf, artificial means, then again, um, those work much better if you are in a straight line that, uh, they are subject to bend. Right. We've seen lots of reports. We, we've put them in JPT about, um, those undulations during production can cause slugging because the gas, uh, basically builds up behind a, sort of a, a water sump. Uh, and then also if you, if you have too steep of a, uh, or severe of a dogleg, uh, then we've seen people with rod lift, like you can run, uh, rub a hole in the casing or the tubing in just days. Um, you know, that's, that's a pretty well documented problem too. These are all headaches that, uh, that when unconventional drilling kind of started, they, they weren't really discussed, but over the last, you know, I would say the last five years, these become pretty popular, uh, topics and drivers trying to get people, uh, in drilling closer to the people in production, uh, so that they can, you know, kind of see each other's own problems. Yes, we have worked with a few companies that actually, um, well, because of the high density data, they, they were using this, uh, primarily for the placement of, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the artificial leaf, uh, the uh, the high density data, they, they were using this, uh, primarily for the placement of, uh, ESPs, electrical submersible pumps. So in many cases, they have, um, issues with the pumps, like after a week, and these are very expensive, uh, piece of equipment. Oh, yeah, the, uh, the ESPs are almost a million dollars each, I, I hear. I think they are about a quarter of a million dollars. But yeah, if you, if you break a couple and these were lasting only for a week and plus the lost production and the work overtime and all that, so we, well, we have shown that with the high density data, you can, uh, establish if the pumps is going to last or you really, there were cases in which you say, well, this well was drilled in such a way that, uh, there is no good place for it, so I'm going to have to convert it to a artificial leaf. But certainly putting the, the drilling people with the production and completion people together has been very beneficial for this operator because now everybody can see it's not that the, the drilling department drill wells and they just forget about it and, and go into the. Right, which was, which was sort of the accepted siloing of the business, uh, years ago was, you know, drillers had one mandate, which was to drill fast, right? And, and bring those drilling days down from 40 to five or four in some cases we've seen in the Permian. Uh, but then as those, like, I call them like the, the, the rig speed records, as those all got shattered, this, this topic of well, war quality, uh, started to come up at, in technical discussions. We obviously saw it on papers and then companies like gyro data come along with, with some advanced technology. Uh, before we get into, to some of those things, the things that you're working on and done with gyro data, I just want to take a quick break and then we'll come right back.

You know, the, the, the, the, the the, the, the, the, the, the, the you know, the technology you guys have been developing. You know, you've been with gyro data for, you said 15 years? So you've seen, you know, you've seen this company really evolve and also this space. So go ahead and tell me about, you know, you know, what is y'all's latest and greatest technology? What are y'all bringing to the market? All right. Yeah. I'll give you a little background before starting. So we initially started with the gyro survey and in, in case in for orientations and kickoff points, that's the area they usually have magnetic interference and you cannot use a magnetometer. So a high accuracy system was developed. You're talking about the kickoff points. So we joined the curve. Where, where do I want my lateral section to go out and begin at what degree or inclination I want it to start oriental whip stock. Okay. Yeah. If it's vertical, then you need some, well, the magnetometer doesn't work because you have magnetic interference and because it's vertical, the accelerometers don't give you any idea of the orientation or tool face. But with the gyro, you can measure the earth rotation and orient that so you can start drilling in the desired direction. So that was successful. Then there was more interest to increase the, the, the accuracy of the, of the weld work placement. And so we developed gyros that, well, with a higher inclination capability and then a drop gyro that the, the main advantage was it doesn't take any rig time. You drop the tool after you get to a section TD and when you pull out of the hole, it produces a survey. Is that like wire line deployed or? No, that's just a drop. It's a memory tool. Okay. The wire line is good because you have all the, the, you can have a lot of data density and you can see in real time what's going on, but you are preventing the rig from drilling and you don't, that's cost money and nobody likes to just stop the, the drill for, for save brain. So those are still used, but are not as popular as a, as a drop gyro. Then in the early 2000, we came out with the gyro while drilling tool, which is basically is similar to standard NWD, but we take a gyro survey while drilling. So every time the drilling process stops to make a new connection and you, you connect with another piece of pipe, then we are stationary and that's where we take a survey. Now you had to be stationary and no vibrations that'll, that'll set off the measurements in the wrong direction. Is that why you need everything to stop? Yes. Yes. Basically the gyro measures rotation, which is a, well, a special kind of movement, I guess. And so if you have that as the magnetometer cannot distinguish between the different magnetic fields, while the gyro cannot distinguish between the different movements. So it measures the air rotation, but if you are rotating the VHA or moving it, it will affect the quality of the measurement. But then, yeah, we started with the gyro while drilling. First was limited to 20 degrees of inclination. As you go higher inclination, it become, well, the effect of the errors on the azimuth measurements start increasing. So through a series of development, we first came out with the G-WD 40 and then 70. And in 2012, we came up with the G-WD 90, basically a tool that can survey in any orientation while drilling. So if I have a really steep inclination on my lateral, that used to be sort of a challenge for you to get an accurate measurement. But now I can come down off my kickoff point and go up at a pretty high angle. Or any angle, yes. And you can still be accurate. But that was based on the spinning mass gyroscope, which is basically like a tabletop principle. It has a small motor that make a mass spin. And due to the physical properties, when this is subject to rotation, well, it changes the signal output and we can use that to determine the azimuth. So in 2012, yeah, we started developing, we started looking at what is called a solid state similar to what is sometimes called MEMS technology. Basically, non-moving parts is a different principle of operations, but it still is a sensor that measures rotation. So we launched our first product was in 2018, a memory tool, similar to the drop I described, but instead of the spinning mass gyro, it's a solid state gyro. And then we launched last year the GWD version of that, the gyro while drilling using this technology. Okay, I have a few questions. First, let's back up and just talk about gyros. So an accelerometer, a lot of people have heard about this technology, and accelerometers and all this whole world has, you know, why is that technology sort of just entering the scene in the 2000s? I look at my smartphone and we assume that the iPhones made a lot of sensor technology cheaper and we always hear about gyros in this context and I'm wondering, was that a driver or was gyros that area of technology, it's time to be commoditized or can drill a well? Yeah, the first gyros that we started using in the 80s, those were from the aerospace industry. At the time there was no GPS and there was a lot of driver for getting gyros to be more accurate so you can navigate with a plane or a satellite or a missile using these gyros and accelerometers. Then with the advancement on the GPS and then become more popular, the driver for having high accuracy gyros kind of went down. But as technology advanced and all that, there was some, yes, there was some, well, again, driver to get gyros on your phone, but those were kind of a low accuracy and more importantly probably is a limitation on temperatures. Those sensors were very high. Those sensors don't operate higher than, I don't know, 60 degrees centigrade would be the highest in a desert, but down-hauled, that won't get you very far. But there was a development as well of more safety features in cars and some military applications that needed the high temperature. So that also drove the manufacturers to look at sensors with more accuracy but also with higher temperature capability. That's where we found these solid-state gyros that we are using because for a car, usually they are rated to 125 degrees centigrade and for some military application as well. So became again, well, there was an incentive for this company to develop this technology. And now if you add the fact that for many applications, you don't want to be connected with the GPS. You want to be off the grid. So if you have a good gyro, a good accelerometer, you can navigate without depending on the GPS and without anyone knowing. So there is also more developments on that area. And so you used to have actual spinning mass gyros, right? That was sort of the entry for gyro data. But what's special about solid state, I think you mentioned it can handle higher temperature. So that sort of takes you into the HPHT world of oil and gas drilling? Yeah, the other aspect was the spinning mass gyro because of the nature. If you subject it to a lot of shock and vibration, you start generating some small imperfections or bending inside the gyros that created what is usually known as mass imbalance. Imagine it's a spinning wheel and if you keep shaking it, something will happen to it. And that created errors in the measurements. The solid state because it's a different principle doesn't have this error which was one of the main contributors to the uncertainties. So now it's a gyro that basically can take as much as a magnetometer regarding shock and vibration. At the risk of getting into the weeds here, are there any moving parts in a solid state gyro? Well, there is a small vibration but it's in the order of the nanometers. So there's a vibration that when it's subject to rotation, it changes its nature and you can sense that. But it's really not something that you would be able to see. So for all practical purposes, yeah, it doesn't have any moving parts. So it sounds like a pretty big leap from having the spinning mass gyros. So I'm just curious, in your eyes, how big of an advancement in technology is it? And how many years did that take to develop? And are there other companies in different verticals using solid state gyros for other things? Yeah, there are a few other companies. For us, it was a well, we wanted to maintain the accuracy of the spinning mass gyro which is very accurate depending on the gyro. The problem was that the calibration or the sensor could change on the drilling environment. So for us, we started this process in 2012 until we came out with the first product in 2018. So that's six years of R&D for you guys. Yes, yes. To give you an idea, we went from a tool with all the electronics required to run the gyro from 16 feet to 3 feet. So that's a great advantage for the down hole. We reduced the power to about 15% of the previous technology. So this made the battery last long. We now can drill the hole well, survey while drilling and survey while pulling out of the hole. So there are many, many advantages. Are you using mud pulse telemetry to send the data back up? Yeah, we can use any technology. Yeah. But also the number of electronics requires to run this gyro from 8 to 2. So the reliability increases a lot. You have less components, less connectors, less wires. And the subunit is just 3 feet long. Yes. Yes. I love when things get really small but they help make giant decisions. And one thing that you guys and other people have talked about in regards to staying in the target location or horizon and shale is the ellipsis of error. And so have you seen, you know, so for all those, for the listening public here, we're sort of talking about this. It's an ellipsis. So it's like an oval-shaped sort of dotted line that goes around the center of your drill bit. And this is the error area that you could be either dead center or you could be 15 feet up or 15 feet down. But we can tell you if you're in that circle, sort of like the cone of uncertainty for hurricanes, right? We can tell you you're in here or out of here but not precisely where you are inside of that ellipsis. And so have you seen this ellipsis of error shrink because of the technologies like this? Yes. Yes. Of course it depends on the well board profile and the location and the actual situation. So for a vertical well, it doesn't make a lot of difference. So if you're in a vertical well, you are centered on the tool. And we know that no vertical well is truly vertical, right? So even in a vertical well, you're never really drilling straight down. You have an ellipsis of error even in that scenario. Correct. Yes. But it doesn't make much different whether you use one sensor or another to measure the orientation because it's mostly vertical and the error sources is mostly the misalignment and the inclination. But when you go to your deviated well, especially the unconventional with the long line, then you start seeing a big difference. And we see a reduction of depending on what tool and, again, the orientation if you are north or south, it's not the same at east or west. But we see a reduction of 30 or 40% on the list of uncertainty which is we feel that is really important. Sometimes there are unknowns and people drill these wells and they don't know why. Well, here I got good production and this other well is following the same principles in the same formation with the same driller. I got half of the production. But if you don't have a good measurement of where you are, you may be really close to the other well and you are taking oil from the other well. Right. You bring up a great point which is even within trying to get spacing measurements down, we've seen the analyst groups try to do this from public data and it's actually very hard to know where the wells are. So when we look at well spacing people are like, well, it's 300 feet apart and the purists will say 300 feet at which point along that two mile lateral. And even those are hard questions for everybody to answer just because the surveying is so tough. And I was on a webinar actually they were doing that. They were analyzing public data and I asked, well, how do you know that the wells were placed where they say they were and they're looking at the data and it says that this is the position so this is the position but they don't take into account this uncertainty and the larger the uncertainty the more that this analysis becomes kind of useless because you may be analyzing this but the wells can be very close or far apart or even outside the formation or even sometimes crossing some lease line and you are drilling on your neighbors. To your point maybe you can say that the well bore is a relatively small group within shale which is a relatively small group but they carry a big stick. When they talk I always listen because they're becoming sage these days as more and more companies learn that if I place my well bore just inches in a different position then that could direct the outcome of this well. So they're talking about these getting within these just these wells and then they're talking about the wells and then they are talking about the well horizons so they can take advantage of all the geomechanical benefits and stress and all this but if they're off by and some people say inches if we're off by inches then we will have a poor completion in this segment of the well. So that you know there's another crowd that says well we can never be that accurate or should we even try because of how much work it would require to be that accurate but you must see the whole spectrum of people who are like just stay within this 100 foot you know source rock and we're good. Yeah, yeah I think there is a bit of a misunderstanding or misinformation on the different departments of the companies with the geologies and the drilling and the completion. The targets sometimes they have a well not everybody understand the uncertainty related when they do the reservoir model there is a lot of uncertainty associated with that and that transmit that information into a target and then transmit that to the directional driller how precise you need to be. Yeah, there is when we say well this is the uncertainty that this survey tool will produce a lot of people are really surprised to see well I thought because you give me a line that the well was on that line. Well that's what the survey says you are likely to be there but you are as likely to be at any other place in the ellipse of uncertainty. So we draw a picture of the reservoir and we say I want to stay within this layer and then so that's one picture then we superimpose another picture which is the well board survey and so you know we're looking at two things that are basically estimates and you're just trying to reconcile both of them and stay as accurate but I think you're sort of speaking to the unknown aspects of drilling these wells and you're trying to get closer and closer to the bulls eye incrementally but you know where that bulls eye is it just kind of depends on the eye of the beholder. Yeah and imagine if you drill this well and your line is on the actual reservoir and you don't get any old what they do is then they shift the depth or the placement of the reservoirs instead of saying well maybe the survey is wrong and we didn't hit the reservoir so it's have to close the loop and it may result in important decisions from abandoning a field or making different assessments. Now we just we had a story on JPT on our website not long ago about sort of the diverse market in Texas I believe there was almost 80 MWD and directional drilling companies in the country and we had a lot of people that were interested in the field and they were interested in the MWD and directional drilling companies serving just the Texas market which you know if you're not familiar represents about half of onshore U.S. production almost like four and a half million barrels a day or more and so it's no surprise but I was really surprised by the diversity not that there was so many people coming in but just that there was all these companies and they were actually you know nobody really had more than 10% market share so you know when you look back at it it's really interesting to see how much people are interested in the MWD and about watching the uptake of this technology was there a point in time where operators you know especially in the U.S. they're always looking for the lowest cost well where they weren't using these technologies and then they gradually gravitated towards them no no pun intended there well I think as you have so many MWD you mentioned company service companies is the same with the with the operators so they have a large number of wells and I think also because of this well all these different operators many have different goals some wants to drill a well and stay we stick to the field and really produce as much as they can there were a group of people that actually were drilling wells and selling them so yeah the flippers yes and so and then their cases they're just looking at well drill as fast as you can and then move and drill to the other one and try to sell it as fast as you can and so on so that what we see is the usually the bigger companies that try to develop the field and they are going to stick to their wells they try to do a much better job of placing the wells in the right place build them straight so they can put artificial leaf means and don't have to spend a lot of time and money on workovers so it really depends some companies provide quality control and a very good job but sometimes the small operator or the yeah they don't have all the infrastructure and they look at the future that far they just. Right we've definitely seen how business models dictate your development strategy and how you track these wells and where you land them one of the other things I wanted to get you to talk about before we jump into the next stage of the job is the next stage of the job. One of the things I wanted to jump off here was you know some of the HSC type issues you know the collision events that you can try to prevent by doing you know robust MWD and gyro surveying I've actually been on location where they drilled a new child well a new well within five feet of the heel of a parent well and when they when they were doing the frac bashing frac hit and they weren't using you know the highest the latest and greatest technology on this so they really they only realize you know towards the end of the project that they had landed that well so close to another one and they paid for it you know they actually said if we were trying to hit that other well we couldn't have done it but we did and so you know can you talk about those kind of events that you know your technology can help prevent and and how it all folds into well spacing yeah yeah so usually there are two types of collisions and usually they are classified there as an HSC in which you have a really an important damage to the environment health and safety there can be some casualties so that's obviously something that nobody wants and nobody plans for that and then you have a the other type of collisions that can just have a financial impact so the one that you described probably was more a financial impact and some companies even planned or taking into account well if we have the if we have a collision according to the well plan and the ellipses of uncertainty if the list of uncertainty start overlapping then that means that you may have one well very close or actually hitting the other well but they look at the consequences of the collision and they may have one that is producing or if it's an old well and they may leave with that because well it's just they they got to model it out and say how often is that likely to happen how much will it yes and how many how much is going to cost me to deviate this well or survey or stop and survey properly and or range or use some some technologies to stay away usually if you are offshore or if it's an important project and you are not able to do it well and you are not able to do it well and you are not able to do it well producing with pressure you wouldn't make that because the cost of doing a successful relief well and your reputation the environmental damage the casualty you cannot afford to do that and so people then will take the measurements to a 40 million dollar well it's a no brainer right it's the 6 million dollar well the 7 million dollar well that"
SPE Talks Tech: Top 10 Stories of 2019,"Hello everyone and welcome. I'm Jason Antouros. We have a really interesting topic here today discussing the way forward for petroleum engineers, a unique look at the academia angle of all this. One of the biggest questions that I've received at a lot of SPE events is should I pursue or continue a degree in petroleum engineering? Is that a major that is going to do me well 10 years down the road? And both of our guests, both of whom are department heads from highly reputable petroleum engineering departments in the United States, are going to be moving into this discussion. So our guests today are going to be Jeff Spath from Texas A&M University and Jennifer Miskemans from the Colorado School of Mines. And I think SPE is uniquely positioned to bridge this conversation between the oil and gas workforce and academia because really when these two arms of the industry work in harmony, I think that the future can be quite bright. So let's go ahead and bring both of our guests into this conversation. Welcome. Thank you, Jason. Thank you. Glad to have both of you here. I know that this conversation could have been completely different six months ago. So to add a little bit of context in this conversation, COVID-19 really changed the way that the university system worked. And going back into March, April and May, almost overnight, things did have to make some adjustments. Spring semester or quarter, however your system uses it, of 2020, it's going to be referenced for years the way that adjustments were made. So what were some key adjustments that both of you had to make? Jeff, we can start with you. Okay, sure. Thank you, Jason. So beginning with spring break, which was mid-March, our students returned to campus only to find that everything except dining facilities and libraries and dormitories were closed. So they had no access to their research labs, they had no access to the teaching labs, and of course they had no access to face-to-face instruction. So to the credit of both the faculty and the students, I think within a week or two at most, everybody seemed at least comfortable with either remotely or via courses that were specifically designed to be online. A significant difference obviously is that they were physically not able to come to campus, they had to do their learning, they had to do their homework, they had to have their exams proctored by distance. And so, you know, for better or worse, I think we managed to continue the teaching and examinations to a reasonably high standard. But obviously one of the things, you know, I've had a lot of conversations with students, one of the things that they didn't get was the social aspect, the ability to interact physically face-to-face with their instructor and the ability to continue their research. So there was actually some good things that came out of this, and I think we'll be using these going forward probably, you know, forever because we've learned a lot about how we can instruct students remotely and virtually. But obviously they missed out on a lot too, and so going forward we're going to try to combine the good things we learned from this experience with a hybrid model in which some of the courses and all of the research is performed in person. I think from our side, Colorado School of Mines, we were very similar to A&M. Within a span of about two weeks, our students really didn't even come back from spring break. They were told that not to come back to campus if at all possible and that everything would be going online. Had to shut down the research labs, have since started to open those back up. I think probably one of the more difficult things was for the seniors graduate students that were scheduled to graduate because they didn't get to finish out that semester with their peers, so they had to have some virtual graduations and deal with that side of thing. But I think from the teaching standpoint, very similar to what Jeff said, kudos to everybody involved, the faculty and the students came very quickly up to speed on just how to offer those classes and to get as much of the experience out of it as possible, but definitely achieve the learning outcomes that we were shooting for in that case. Thank you again for taking time for this. What will it be like to apply internationally for entry-level positions in the near future? Is that something that you could both shed a little bit more light on? Jennifer, we can go ahead and start with you on that one. Sure, I think applying from the international standpoint, I think brings some short-term challenges with it. I think with the level of travel restrictions that we're seeing worldwide becomes a little bit of an issue with physically moving or applying to positions like that. I think it's probably very dependent on the company as far as how they're willing to work with remote, but from an academic standpoint, that's a concern that we have about just bringing people into the classroom in the fall in international situations like that. Personally, I think it's probably going to be delayed a little bit if it's an in-person type of situation. I'm not really sure if those opportunities will necessarily not be there, but just rather be delayed. Are you considering becoming an SPE member? When you join SPE, you join a society of dedicated professionals just like you, working to address the technical challenges of the global oil and gas industry. SPE membership gives you the opportunity to make local and global connections and build a network of influential technical leaders from every discipline. Learn more at spe.org. Getting back to a little bit how the university model has changed a little bit in light of all these situations, what lessons were learned in March, April, and May that will be included in your upcoming plans? Jeff? Yeah, obviously we learned as we went along, and I mentioned before the proctoring of exams, which is something you don't think much about until you have 40 or 60 students, each with their own camera and laptop in their living room, trying to take an exam. There's various methods, commercial firms that do this, which we've utilized. We utilize teaching assistants, of course, various technologies to ensure, let's say, ethical taking of the exams, big issue that we didn't foresee until it was actually in front of us. Difficulties that we had, notwithstanding any IT, was the ability to communicate back and forth with the students. This is why you have face-to-face teaching in the first place. I feel like, again, having spoken with a lot of students, one of the first things they missed was that personal interaction with a professor. And I'm talking about just straight lectures here. It gets worse, of course, when you talk about caps for students, for example, where you're expected to work in a team. It's very difficult, and I'm not sure we've reached complete consensus on how best to teach capstone courses remotely. And then you have the labs, which it's painful to have to sit at home and watch a teaching assistant or a lecturer perform the lab on video and then send you the data. It's just not the same. So there's no doubt that there's still a lot to be done. And I think this is the main reason or one of the two main reasons why going forward this fall, and I think Colorado School of Mines is in the same boat, we're doing hybrid courses. So those courses that require a lot of interaction, such as capstone design courses and lab work, we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's on campus and face to face. And Jennifer, I do want to give you an opportunity to respond to that also coming up. But I think this kind of goes along lines of what Jeff was just talking about with getting everyone acclimated to the new virtual environment or the hybrid environment. Any advice that you can give for students who are not able to meet face to face right now, students who would have gone to SPE events or maybe had some other opportunity to meet face to face with a mentor, what can they be doing? Is it LinkedIn? Is there another option? Jennifer, what advice do you have for them? Yeah, I've had that discussion with quite a few of my students too, individually. It's a concern they have because of job market and just that networking capability. What I'm telling them and maybe a little bit of a plug for SPE, but SPE is holding a lot of virtual networking events. Whether it's SPE or other venues, there's a lot of lunch and learn type opportunities out there. And so trying to encourage them not to get frustrated just because they're locked away at home, whatever, and can't get out, to do it virtually. There's a lot of opportunities to get out there and have networking opportunities with whether you're listening to a podcast somewhere that's live or whether there's even roundtables like this, to just get out there and get a chance to meet people. And it's really no different than the physical networking. Sometimes that's tough for people and it's something that people have to work at. This just brings a different option to it that has to be done virtually. So get out there and get to meeting people. Don't just get locked away. And if I could add to that, I'm glad you mentioned SPE, Jennifer, because it's my understanding that in some of these conferences and workshops, etc., that are going virtual, there are separate, there's a parallel area, if you like, virtual area for networking. And so even though you can't go to Eartek in Austin or one of the upcoming workshops, you can still tune in to the event and do your networking. And I suppose the nice thing is it's a level playing field, right? If nobody's able to go to these conferences and events, then do your best networking virtually because everyone else is. And networking over the years is a function has adapted anyway. So this is just a new form of adaption for networking, getting people up to par on that. Another interesting question. This kind of goes back to Jennifer giving you an opportunity to answer how everything will be changing in the fall. If things do get worse in the fall regarding the coronavirus, teaching wise, any type of education wise, what would you do differently then that hasn't happened as of yet now? Yeah. So I think we're, you know, it's a really steep learning curve. It happened really quickly for us. And I think there's a lot of things that we're starting to learn about it. Jeff mentioned it, the, you know, one is just how to make sure that exams are administered correctly, that people have that same playing field, that level playing field as far as being able to submit homework and take their exams. I think the other thing that we've probably learned about is even in this day and age, how access sometimes for people to online services, whether it's, you know, I've got a couple of people right now that are in internships that they can't get good internet because they're somewhere out in the middle of nowhere. So getting people accessibility to those online opportunities. The other thing that, and I think it's, I think this is very specific to petroleum engineering is that we have so many students that if they are not on campus, and we are going live also, we're absolutely planning on going live, but we know that not everybody will be able to return to campus. We have to be really cognizant of time zone considerations. We have to hold office hours such that, you know, that everybody has access to those. So I think there's, I think it really is kind of a lot of just making sure that everybody's needs are addressed when we go into these online situations. And I think the big question that everyone has, and Jeff, I'm going to direct this one to start with you and the Jennifer, you can follow up, but that popular question is, and we can even reference the downturn, should I even be studying petroleum engineering? You look at people who maybe are trying to start a family and how difficult that can be if there's a downturn now every decade or so. In Texas alone, we can look at the fact that there have been 26,000 jobs lost in the month of April, the largest that I could find on record for a single month. So how do you respond when a student or a perspective student asks you that question? Should I be pursuing a degree in petroleum engineering? Yes. And why? It's my fault for asking a yes no question, right? We'll all ask that question. The first thing I'd say is that cycles aren't unique to the oil and gas business. By any means, they might be more frequent given they're tied to a commodity, but they're certainly not, it's not unique to our industry. Of course, we see it more than we see any other industry. The second thing I'd say, somewhat joking when I said yes, there's no doubt that we are in the very early stages of a very long energy transition. You look at any credible predictions, you know, whether it's from ExxonMobil or BP or the IAA, and hydrocarbons will continue to supply by far the majority of our global energy demands well into the 50s, the 2050s. So that's a long career right there. Don't forget about petrochemicals and fertilizers and other uses that petroleum has. It isn't just electricity generation and it isn't just the fuels to fuel your automobile. So I don't think I'm being too biased when I say that the oil and gas business will be around for decades to come. The world is going to continue to require petroleum and its derivatives. So it's going to continue to require petroleum engineers. And at Texas A&M, we're actually doubling down on this. We're sticking to our guns, if you like, and not trying to move into other forms of renewables, for example, like some programs are. We feel like there will be a, I hate to give a number, but generations still of petroleum engineers required in our industry. Like Jeff's answer to that, yes. I second the energy transition comments. It's a transition. It's not a switch. And a lot of people, when you talk to them that are outside the industry and don't look at it from a big picture standpoint, they think that there's this magical switch that we're all of a sudden going to go from fossil fuel based energy to others. It's not. It's going to take time. It takes plenty of time. There's plenty of time, like Jeff was saying, for careers to be made in that realm. And even if you want to look at it from a more short term and short term, long term, it's relative to people. But from a short term standpoint, as we conquer this COVID as a human race, the economy is going to start to turn around. And as the economy turns around, energy drives economies. And so as we start to see that pick up in the short term and get the economy turned around, we're going to see a need for energy and a demand for PEs. And that's going to continue on to the future as we go along with it. So noting towards the future, then most universities saw petroleum engineering enrollments cut in half in the United States as a result of the 2014 to 2016 downturn. What needs to happen to either bring those numbers up or are the numbers not really as big of a concern as they sound? And if so, why? I'm not concerned. I think if you look at any history of petroleum engineering enrollment, it's cyclical. We're in a cycle now, which is deeper than most because of the combination of the two events we're all familiar with. And so it might take a little longer to bounce back. But you see demand coming back already. I saw this morning that airlines are up 25% occupancy from their low and they're not flying on battery power or windmills or anything. So I would tell students, prospective students, that look and say, oh, the numbers are down. Why would I get into this? This is a temporary downturn. And I won't speak for Jennifer, but I've been around long enough to see five or six of these, whether it's due to oil embargoes or geopolitical events or the Gulf War I or the Gulf War II or market share driven downturns, you name it. This is just another downturn and it will come back. And so I'm not particularly worried about undergraduate enrollment. What I'm worried about is graduate enrollment for purposes completely beyond anyone's control, such as the ability to get here and the ability to get visas. The very nature, it's cyclic. What goes down, and like Joe said, we're in a deep one, but what goes down is going to go back up. And it's the nature of the game. Anybody that goes into this industry has to be at least aware of that. We have major cycles, we have minor cycles in and around it, but it's a great industry to be in. Jeff and I wouldn't have been in it as long as we've been in it. And a lot of other people, if we didn't love it and have a passion for it, I think anybody that's going into it just needs to realize that and be aware of it. But if you hang on and you have that passion, it's a great place to have a career. And getting that career, one of the first steps for many is the internship. How to get an internship, what steps to make. Is that something that the students should be doing something different in, in this new world that we're living in, or is there adjustments that companies can be making to better reach out to these petroleum engineering soon to be graduates? I think it's both. I'm not sure about A&M, but we're getting ready to do a virtual career fair. And I think a lot of people are probably looking to do that. When I say we, Mines is in the fall. There's going to be some things that are going to be different about that. I think there's also going to be some interesting things that are going to be opportunistic for students. You know, instead of having to wait in a really, really long line, they've got an equal opportunity to see different companies and to seek out these different companies that are coming from for a career path and for the career fair. But I think from the company side of it, they are also realizing that, okay, we're going to have to do things differently. They might have limitations on being able to travel or being able to get around campus to campuses. So I think there's going to be some definite logistical changes. I don't think the bottom line, you know, applying networking, getting involved, developing a good resume, I don't think any of that's going to change. It's just how we approach it and how we go through it. Yeah, internships are very, very important. In fact, we require our seniors to have taken at least one internship before we let them register for senior courses. We like to think we have a good reputation for putting graduates out there that contribute on day one. And how do you do that? You spend time sitting on a rig or sitting in an office or what have you. And so this downturn, again, similar to previous downturns, the companies can help by, for example, splitting the summer into two and hiring, you know, interns for the first half and half a dozen for the second half, and that will satisfy the requirement. What we're doing in the department to facilitate this, given that it's a requirement, is we're replacing, you know, traditional internships where you might go sit a rig, and we're combining research with workshops. So we've reached out to various software vendors and operators and service companies to deliver anywhere from a couple days to two-week workshops. And the students have the option of picking this workshop, that workshop, combining it with a two-week research project with this professor or that professor, and that satisfies the requirement for an internship. But for the students, the only thing I can, the only advice I can give students and I tell them this all the time, I don't know if they listen, but don't wait until your junior year because you have to start early. Companies are only hiring full-time positions these days from their intern pools, so you really have to think early even as a freshman and get that most basic job. And this is the other thing I tell students is I don't care what your first job is, whether it's full-time or over the summer, if it's painting, you know, painting the dog houses on the rig site or driving around in a truck strapping tanks, I know that's an outdated example, but do whatever it is you can to get some kind of experience to get your foot in the door for the next one. Yeah, the foot in the door is very important. And another resource that is available to the students who have recently graduated who are out there looking for their first job, SPE does have an industry job board. It's a tool for members and it's for employers too. It's dedicated to positions within the oil and gas and related industries. So we can include a link to that in the description of this post as a resource that any SPE member could also use. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SPE programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other SPE members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location or experience level. To learn more about the League of Volunteers, visit spe.org slash volunteer. So what skills can students and recent grads really focus on right now to ensure that they have longevity in their career? Whether it's thinking about the skills that will actually just get you in that first step like Jeff was mentioning, get you in the door to be recognized by the company and then what will also just ensure that longevity once you're there as well? Well, first thing I'd say is, you know, don't focus on skill sets that are going to give you that long career. Focus on what you need when you graduate. And most programs around the world, we have been tweaking our to include things that industry is asking for. The subjects around ESG, the subjects around data analytics and the application of machine learning to problem solving. We've done that and we're going to add courses as we, you know, I've got a very strong industry board that I meet with several times a year and they tell me what recruiters want in a graduate. And so the curriculum is constantly changing. I wouldn't worry so much about what skills you need outside of petroleum engineering, but you can think about, you know, I give advice to a lot of students who are maybe hesitant to commit to a master's degree in petroleum. And so I think I see that as a question. Goodbye. You know, take petroleum engineering as a minor, petroleum engineering graduate, take a related minor, take finance, chemical engineering, take data science as a minor, you know, broaden your skills base. But I would worry about those first skills to get the first job again, rather than what you're going to need. Who knows what you're going to need. When I got out of school, it certainly wasn't data science. I think it was EOR was the big 80s. And so don't try to predict is going to be a required skill in 10 years. Focus on doing as much as you can within petroleum engineering and then make sure your electives are in something that interests you, obviously, but something that will add marketability to yourself, like a data science, like a finance, like chemistry, etc. Jennifer, can you add to that? And then also maybe discuss how can what you learn as a petroleum engineer in university potentially be applied to other fields? So, you know, the following up with the first discussion, diversification, I think is important. I mean, we want to have people that are very, very well trained in petroleum engineering and have that base of petroleum engineering, but kind of like Jeff said, you know, taking electives or taking minors in areas that you have an interest in can supplement that base education, but also provide you with that opportunity for diversification. So, you know, the data analytics is a big one. We have a minor at Mines and Data Analytics. We also this fall are launching an online certificate in data analytics. We are looking at things like we have a minor in Midstream. For a long time, those are worked through our department, but we also have opportunities to get minor in engineering economics. We have what's known as a four plus one option where if somebody is interested in a master's, they can double count some of their credits from their bachelor's to a master's degree and work through that master's a little bit quicker. So, I think it's that diversification. It's looking for you. You still want to have interest in it. Nobody wants to take classes that they don't have to and don't like, but that'll help with future endeavors, both short term and long term. I think from the outside petroleum side of things, I think there's some opportunities, maybe some more that, you know, petroleum engineers, we study fluid flow and porous media. So, things like geothermal energy options meet naturally with that and we're seeing some increased interest in that. But we're a petroleum engineering department. We're going to stay a petroleum engineering department for quite some time to come. We just want to provide students some of those outside opportunities also and things that they can look at to help strengthen those skills. Just let me jump in here because you mentioned diversification and I couldn't agree more. When you think about the skills, when you think about the core competencies in graduate, it's understanding the subsurface. Why not think about industries like geothermal as Jennifer mentioned? Why not think about methane hydrates and mining? We just finished a minor in our cutter campus on midstream, okay, because petroleum engineers understand fluids and they understand thermodynamics or they should. And so, you know, these are things that on the edges of traditional petroleum engineering will make you that much more marketable. I mean, when you think about the main recruiters, they're already broadening their portfolios out of oil and gas. So we have to do the same to educate and as we graduate so that they'll get jobs. What about that next level of learning? Whether it's pursuing a master's, a PhD, is that something people can be doing with their time right now? More people are saying that they have a little bit more time on their hands working from home, a little bit more access to the internet and using the tools that are available there. What advice would you give someone who says they do have a little bit of extra time right now? How are a few ways that they could be investing? Well, yeah, we're probably going to say the same thing. Well, I think it circles back to some of the earlier discussion, right? We have a lot more now online opportunities that people, if they do have some time on their hands, whether they're formally pursuing a degree or not, there's a lot of places to learn and as you learn and you get that information, that's a great thing to put on a resume and you put it on a resume and that leads to future opportunities and improved opportunities. So I don't think you can ever go wrong learning more. It's just what do you have that interest in and where do you want to go with that? So go ahead. I would say that you don't, again, the short answer is should you get an advanced degree in your spare time? Hell yeah. I worked for four or five years and then went back and got my master's, worked and came back to the same company, worked another four or five years, went and got my PhD, came back to the same company. But it doesn't necessarily have to be formal in the sense of getting a MS or a PhD. And I tell people this in management all the time, just make sure you're continuously improving yourself and continuously educating yourself, whether it's an SPE short course or a distance learning master's degree. We have a huge number of people right now. We talked about how enrollment was going down physically, our distance learning enrollments going through the roof, exactly for this reason. They're working from home, they have time on their hands and they're getting their master's of engineering in most cases in petroleum engineering. So the summary there is yes, whether or not you have spare time because of this virus, I have always encouraged employees and students both to constant continuous education or you'll fall behind. Then on the SPE front too, there's online resources, the online trainings, the webinars, whether you're looking for CEUs or just to continue your education in some degree, that's all available. We'll include those links in the description of the post too. Also, I would even encourage any student to look out and see, you know, is there a chapter that I could join at my university? It's an SPE chapter and is there a section in the region that I can filter up in and network there and learn more from people who may have gone through what I'm going through right now, whether it be in my discipline or in my regional loan, if you're going to stay in the same region. That's something else that people have been asking too with, now that we've seen whether it's going to be considered by some the same downturn or a downturn every three years or so, if this trend continues, is that something that is being forecast at all? Is this something we should be concerned about three years from now to see this come back again? Or how can we prepare to make that not happen from an academic standpoint? I'm going to turn this easy question over to Jennifer because it's so easy. I'll reach into my closet back here behind me and get my crystal ball out and then we can work that out. If someone takes this and uses it three years from now and says, well, you said this was going to happen, I mean, that's not what we're looking for. This is just... No, but I think seriously, first of all, I never give predictions on oil price. In fact, I never listened to anybody give predictions on oil price and therefore cycles. But what we can do as educators is make sure that we give the students, the graduates, the skills, and we've talked about this already, but to make them as flexible as possible, as broad as possible, but rather than teaching them very specifics subject-wise, you have to teach them fundamentals and then teach them how to solve problems so that they can graduate. Look, when companies hire petroleum engineers, they want petroleum engineers and in good times, if they can't get them, what do they do? They get mechanical engineers and electrical engineers and civil engineers and aerospace engineers and they turn them into petroleum engineers in their in-house training programs. Okay, so there's nothing saying the converse of that can't work. If you're a petroleum engineering graduate and in three years, there's another significant downturn and you find yourself without employment, then go to work as an engineer. Be as broad as you can and as educators, we have to make sure that they graduate with these problem-solving skills so that they're flexible enough to weather the next downturn. Yeah, and I'd have to, you know, it's interesting when you look at the downturns and we look at, you know, hiring numbers and percent placement and whatnot and our, I think at Mines and I think at a lot of universities, the interesting thing is even when we see a decrease in percent placement in petroleum engineering, a lot of times that's actually, the value is still, that percent placement is still higher than a lot of the other engineering disciplines that are being placed out there. So even when we see some downturns, I think it's because we do have some really broad skills that the PEs might not go into the industry right at that point in time, but they have skills like Jeff's saying that they can get hired in a lot of other places and so, yeah, we don't like to see those percentages go down at all, but I think we have to put it in context when we look at other situations and other opportunities that people are looking at that we're still in really good shape even in some of the rough years. Now, the caveats out there that, you know, of course this is a unique situation, but we see that in most of the downturns, so, you know, it might be slightly different in this case, but the base truth should hold. I'm glad you brought that up and if I have a second for a little story. So I started in academia just over two years ago and one of the first, my first questions was, what is our placement ratio? How many of our children engineering graduates get jobs upon graduation within say six months? And it was 80 something percent. I think it was mid 80s, doesn't matter. And I thought, well, we have to do much b"

Kevin holds a master's in reservoir evaluation and management from Harriet Watts University and a master's in electronics from the University of Edinburgh. Ian, Marta, Kevin, welcome to the SPE Live. Thank you, Kamel. Welcome to everybody joining us live. Thank you, Kamel. Well, it looks like we have lost Ian for a minute here. Okay. But he should be back real quick. Let's give him a few seconds to come back. I guess that's what life makes you. These are some of the pitfalls of being live. Just trying to reach out to Ian. Yeah. Okay. So while we're waiting for Ian, let's go to Marta. Yes. Okay. So Marta, what can the oil and gas sector do immediately to address climate change goals? Well, Kamel, that is an excellent question. And I think a question that a lot of people in Europe, Africa, and the whole world are asking themselves. First, let me start by saying that oil and gas companies are facing a critical challenge as the world is increasingly shifting toward clean energy and working on the energy transition. And now is the time more than ever for the oil and gas industry to say where they stand and what they mean when they are saying that they participate to the energy transition. And to also state what can they do to accelerate this energy transition. But as we all say very well, the oil and gas industry is very, very large. And it's made of a variety of companies that operate in very different locations that have very different constraints. So the answer to what can the oil and gas sector do to immediately address the climate change goals may not be only one. It can be a variety of approaches that will depend on each company circumstances. But there are some things that are maybe a little bit generic, but that will work for everybody, for everybody in oil and gas and for everybody in all industries. The first of them is to make sure that we are all working toward reducing the environmental footprint of our operations. This is true for everybody, but this is very important also for oil and gas. As of today, 15% of the global energy related greenhouse emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground. And to be honest, a large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily. So what can they do? They can work on reducing methane leaks to the atmosphere, which would be the single most important and cost effective way for the industry to bring down those emissions. But those are not the only ones. There are other opportunities There are other opportunities to lower emissions of delivering oil and gas by eliminating and derating flaring and integrating renewables and low carbon electricity into upstream and LNG developments. Those are initiatives that a lot of companies in the North Sea, for example, are already doing and that will be featured during the offshore Europe this year. Other options that oil and gas companies have is diversifying their energy operations to include renewables and other low carbon technologies. Oil and gas companies are very well positioned to do so because we have a very extensive know-how and capital available, which is not the case for other companies. As an industry, we can play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of key renewable options, such as offshore wind, and also enable reaching maturity for some key intensive energy technologies such as carbon capture or the utilization and storage of hydrogen. Something else that oil and gas companies may consider is to invest in alternative fuels such as hydrogen, biomethane and advanced biofuels that are supposed to or are expected to account for about 15% of the overall full supply in about 10 years. If those technologies don't reach maturity, and probably they will only be able to reach maturity if industries like oil and gas invest in them, the energy transition will become much harder and much more expensive. But let's say things as they are. Oil and gas is key, it's part of the energy transition, and it really has a key role to play to it. But we cannot do it alone. For the energy transition to success, we need oil and gas, but we also need governments, investors, companies and everybody to collaborate and to be fully and fully on board. Thank you very much, Marta, for these great insights. Let's move to Ian. Ian, you have quite a large experience, you have recently been a distinguished lecture series with the ESP. My question to you, is there a role for oil and gas in a sustainable future? Thanks, Kamel, and hello, everybody. I do think the answer is very much yes. There is a role for oil and gas in a sustainable future. Thank you very much for your time today. Thank you, Ian. Thank you, Kamel. And that in the long term, hydrocarbons will be dead. Another aspect of what we might be able to do as new technology develops is to actually decarbonize our product. There are chemical and biological technologies currently in universities, which would extract the hydrogen from hydrocarbons, turn the carbon into something useful, and you've got a very different solution to the problem, but it doesn't exist right now. But I guess my view is we don't have an absolute right to survive. We need to work hard and fast to address the threat of climate change that's associated with our product. And a parting thought on this is a few years ago, you might remember that Kodak dominated the photography world, and they died because they didn't think the world could exist without film. So I hope we don't follow the path of Kodak, but it very much is down to us to figure out how we decarbonize our product and our production. Thank you very much, Ian. Let's move to Kevin. About the petroleum engineers that are entering the industry today or will be entering in the New York future, this next generation, have they made a good or bad career choice? Okay, thanks, Kamel. In my view, absolutely they haven't made a bad choice. I think they are making a good career choice. I would start by saying I can understand why the question is being asked. Petroleum engineering can be thought of as being quite specialist, and as Ian's just mentioned, there's a tremendous amount of societal pressure to reduce global emissions and limit the impacts of climate change. However, I do think that they're absolutely the right choice. That there absolutely will be a place for oil and gas in the future. If we make the changes that Ian's just talked about there, there will be a place. If you look at any of the kind of macro studies, how the world's primary energy demand will be met in 2050, most of them converge around 40% to 50% still coming from fossil fuels, down from around 80% today. Absolutely, I think, we will still require the skills of petroleum engineers to produce these products as efficiently as possible. I think actually there's potentially a risk of a skill shortage due to retirements and people diversifying into other areas. Also, we shouldn't forget that CO2 storage and potentially hydrogen storage will be conducted deep underground, and this will require the same skill sets as oil and gas production. So, knowledge of the subsurface, knowledge of fluid flow and porous media, well construction, et cetera. And I do see carbon captured in storage increasingly playing a central role in that low-carbon energy system of the future. I think focusing on the job itself, for me, petroleum engineering is one of the best engineering jobs out there. Exposes you to really interesting and challenging projects. There's lots of opportunity to travel. You're often working in very diverse teams that are rich in collaboration and exposed to the latest technologies. What may change, what will likely change, is the physical location of the assets people are working on as we move from more mature basins to more frontier geographies. I don't see any issues there. It's already routine to be working on data from other parts of the world from where you might be located. And I do think for recent and for new petroleum engineering graduates, it is important to be inside an energy company. That's where you have the opportunity to have a voice to influence how that company operates and how those future opportunities are developed. So, in summary, I think we'll continue to see a strong demand for petroleum engineers and we'll continue to have new developments that will provide great career opportunities. Thank you very much, Kevin. I would like to ask the same question to Ian and Martha. Is that a good career choice to be a petroleum, a new petroleum engineer, Ian? So, I agree with much of what Kevin has said and perhaps would add that if carbon capture and storage and possibly even hydrogen storage is going to happen, then it needs the same skills that we have in the oil and gas industry. You still need geophysicists, you still need geologists, you still need reservoir engineers. It's just the problem is slightly different. You're flowing a fluid the other way and, of course, it's got different properties and you're worried about slightly different things. But, for example, in a carbon capture and storage project, I don't need proven reserves, but I certainly need a proven storage capacity because I'm then going to go and sell that storage capacity to a client who wishes to dispose of their CO2. And if I'm going to sign up to that as a commercial proposition, I need to be confident in the storage capacity. So, I think the same skills are equally applicable in both carbon dioxide storage and in hydrogen storage. And for that reason, I think that certainly students learning today and those already in their careers, yeah, you might have to do a little bit of cross training and sort of get familiar with these new fluids, but it's essentially it's the same skills and I think there will still be a need for those for some time to come. Thank you very much, Ian. Marta? Yeah, so just to build on people working in oil and gas, I think there's still room for young engineers to work in oil and gas. Both my answer and Ian showed how oil and gas has to be very much part of the energy transition. So, I invite every young engineer out there to think if they want to be part of the solution. Do they have a chance? I know oil and gas is not maybe the most popular industry right now, but there is a chance to help an industry that can bring a lot to this energy transition do it right. They can be part of that and they should think really about that. How these will probably have an impact that is more important than it would be maybe on some other opportunities that they have been thinking about. There's a real chance of having a real impact on the energy transition, but on the future of the energy of the world if you work in oil and gas. So, just think about that. Thank you very much to all of you. I just wanted to add that if you take one area which is carbon capture and storage, which was pioneered in the North Sea, in Norway, actually the prospects of going forward is that by the end of the decade, we could be injecting 200 to 400 million tons of CO2 per year in CO2 storage compared to less than 40. So, this will open up quite a wide range of opportunities as was mentioned by our panelists to geophysicists, to reservoir engineers, to drillers, to engage in a new domain. And going forward to 2050, which where the new petroleum engineers will still be working, we could go as high as four or five billion tons of CO2 being injected. So, let me just add another point is that the SPE has engaged in a number of those domains that are peripheral to oil and gas today. And we have created a number of technical sections and one of them is actually related to CO2 storage. I have a very good comment from our colleague, Bob Pearson from Canada, former regional director, who is mentioning that SPE has published a guideline for the storage resource management system, which will provide a basis for SPE estimating storage. And as Ian was mentioning, instead of doing it for an injection system, for a production system, we'll be doing it for an injection system. We have also a hydrogen technical section, which was created under the leadership of Bob Pearson. And we also have a new very active session on geothermal. So, all these are areas that are adjacent and use the skills of our petroleum engineers. So, in the future, petroleum engineers with a very strong background will be able to upskill, to re-skill in those domains which his or her potential is very much in demand. So, let me follow with a question on some perspectives for the North Sea. This would go to Ian. So, what are the perspectives from decommissioning and how can it play a role? So, there's a lot of talk about how decommissioning can support the sustainable future. A lot of people hoping, notably, I think, oil companies that have the decommissioning liability and would like to move it to the right on their schedules. My view is that there is some potential for energy transition to use some of the now unrequired oil and gas assets, but by no means all of them. So, if I start down in the reservoir, when you're injecting CO2 and particularly at the volumes that you were mentioning just a few moments ago, Kamel, you need a lot of empty space underground. And the best source of empty space is a depleted gas field. So, I think depleted gas fields are likely to be probably the leading contenders for storage. Other stores such as depleted oil and gas fields, sorry, oil fields, and certainly aquifers are just a lot harder because there's a lot of, or not so much volume has been removed. And so, you might have to end up doing things like producing brine to create the space for CO2 to get into aquifers. When it comes to the hardware, very different views on different parts of the system, the bit that's most useful is pipelines. Pipelines are generally in good condition and generally easy to reuse for either CO2 or hydrogen purposes. So, I think there's likely that a lot of pipelines will get repurposed in that way. But wells are generally in the wrong place for injecting CO2 or hydrogen and certainly for back production. And platforms, well, they're generally old. So, if you've had an oil and gas platform that's perhaps had a 25, 30, 35, 40 year life, and I'm coming along with a CCS project with a design life of 25 years, I'm beginning to worry about the integrity of the platform. So, I think the platforms are relatively unlikely to be used, at least not very much. And the thing to perhaps have in mind is the reason why we have platforms at all. It's because we produce out of oil and gas wells a mixture of oil, gas, water, bits of sand, bits of scale. We need to access it for repairs and so on. So, well access and processing at the point of production are important. In contrast, if you're injecting CO2 or you're injecting hydrogen, you're injecting a very pure product which you have purified on shore. So, a common view in the oil and gas industry is that CO2 is corrosive. Well, it isn't. It's CO2 plus water is corrosive. So, all you do is take all the water out on shore and you've got a pretty inert substance that you need to pump to. So, subsea injection is a much lower cost alternative. So, my view is that there's not going to be that much reuse and repurposing of old facilities. So, I'm afraid the decommissioning challenge exists and will remain and I think will remain a business for the next few years. It'll be the pipelines which will generally get reused. Thanks Ian. So, let's move to the questions from a very active audience. I'm very pleased to see the attendees from all around the world. One question from Rod Campbell. Do you think that petroleum engineering courses at universities could address future transition requirements by including cryogenic fluids, hydrogen, CO2 interaction at well site, for instance, cap rock fracturing? So, the question is expanding what we normally do for oil and gas in the classical petroleum engineering to more diverse fluids and the interaction of those fluids with the formation. Yeah, I'm happy to jump in there, Camel. I think absolutely. You've already described earlier the potential for CO2 storage and how that could grow and I think this is absolutely what the courses at university should be looking at now. It's looking at these challenges, building out the current syllabus to include hydrogen storage, CO2 storage, understanding each part of the process and doing the necessary research and I think that's already starting to come through. I know internally here we have studies with universities looking at the reuse of our reservoirs, so I think it's a great question and I absolutely agree that that's the way courses need to be pivoting now. Thanks very much, Kevin. So, I have a question about the potential of the new offshore basins in the Atlantic, especially the Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia basins. Is there a potential for them to be a part of the supply of natural gas in the current environment that has uncertainties? Ian, you were I think recently in Mozambique, which is somehow in a similar situation. Yeah, certainly Mozambique's in a similar situation. They will around about now be commissioning major floating LNG facility and exporting their their gas globally. So, I don't think that the geography is actually that significant. It's a broader question of if you've got new oil and gas fields, do you develop them? And remembering how rapidly oil and gas fields decline, I think it is likely that we will need to keep developing new fields for some time to come. As I said earlier, we still depend heavily on hydrocarbons for supplying our energy and I think it's unlikely that governments or individuals will sort of casually agree to stop using all this energy anytime soon. So, I think countries that have made these discoveries can be fairly confident that there will be an application for them, especially if they're gas because the gas essentially produces less carbon dioxide. It's by no means zero, but it's less than things like coal. So, I think the argument that says gas is a good transition fuel is a valid one. It reduces our emissions fairly quickly in a way that we can do quickly and then we go about finding out how to decarbonize the gas at scale. So, my view is continue to develop. There will be a market for some time to come, but be conscious that if you find something big in 25 years time, it might be less useful to us. Thank you very much to all of you. We have many very interesting questions that I would have loved to ask you, including ones about the recent announcement on a nuclear fusion and the potential impact of nuclear fusion on the energy mix of the future. Fortunately, we are running out of time and I would like to close this very interesting discussion by reminding you that this 2023 ESP Offshore Europe Conference, which will celebrate 50 years of Offshore Europe Conference, will be held between September 5 and September 8 in Aberdeen, Scotland. We certainly look forward to seeing you there. The call for papers is still open and we look forward to having receiving great abstracts and very interesting sessions, both from technical sessions and panel sessions. So, thank you all for attending today. Wishing you all the very best for this year. Thank you, Kamal. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Paul. Thank you all. Thanks for listening to the SPE Live Podcast.

Technology Advancements in Managed Pressure Drilling with Steve Nas,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live, oil and gas powering our net zero future. Where are we and what's next? The audio from this episode was previously recorded on October 14th, 2024. Good morning. My name is Skylar Borglum and I'm vice president for WSP. I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Girish Nadkarni is a veteran thought leader in corporate venture investing, a climate tech investor, an entrepreneur and industry executive. He retired as the CEO of Total Energies Ventures in 2022. Before that, he was the founder and president of ABB Technology Ventures, the corporate venture arm of ABB, the global head of ABB's robotics division, automotive business, a CEO at United Healthcare and at GE, where he worked for Jack Welch on strategy and business development. He founded VSimplify, a VC funded pioneering startup in cloud based ASP business services. Girish also has served as an advisor to the World Economic Forum and was on the selection committee to choose the WEF technology pioneers for several years. Girish earned his LLM degree at the University of Virginia, which he attended as a DuPont fellow. He has an MBA from Harvard where he was designated a Baker scholar. Girish, welcome to SPE live. Thank you, scholar. Appreciate the opportunity to chat with you. You're welcome. Good morning. We're glad you're here. So right out of the bat, let's ask how are we doing versus our net zero targets and aspirations? Unfortunately, not as well as we should. As you may recall, post the Paris COP, you know, lots of companies jumped up and declared their net zero targets. People are a lot more comfortable declaring their scope one and scope two because they felt they had more control over that. They were a little hesitant about scope three because it's to do with the supply chain and they weren't sure how to control that. So lots of companies said we will achieve net zero for scope one and two by 2030, 2035 and sort of push back scope three to 2050 or so. But as I'm sure you've seen in the newspapers and other publications, lots of companies are either not talking about it anymore or are indeed pulling back. Some of that is perhaps buyer's remorse. Some of that is a recognition that it is a lot more difficult than they thought it would be. Lots of issues around measurement, reporting, you know, an MRE kind of issues. So and let's not also forget that at least in the US, there has been a lot of pressure from the red states and the Republicans about being anti-EHG who don't believe in climate change. So a lot of companies do not want to be in the target. And so there has been, unfortunately, a little bit or depending upon your point of view, significant pullback from the net zero targets. Very interesting, very interesting. So among the various factors, policy, infrastructure, financing, our own behavioral changes, how important and or urgent is the new technology lever? Do we need innovation with a capital I? Well, innovation is always important, you know, whether it's improving the efficiency of solar cells, whether it's coming up with, you know, more efficient electrolyzers, whether it's trying out new areas of geothermal technology is always important. We can't sit back. But having said that, you know, we are not in the B2C business where let's say, you know, TikTok took nine months to reach 100 million users and chat GPTU, you know, sort of reached 100 million users in barely two months. This is energy. This is about hardware. This is about infrastructure. This is about changing supply chains. This is about changing behaviors. So in as much as new technology is helpful, it takes a long time for new technology to scale. It takes a long time for that scale technology to be adopted, et cetera. So all these things are, you know, new technology is important. It's necessary, but not sufficient. And all the other levers you mentioned, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's policy, whether it's financing, all those are critical to driving the adoption of either existing technology or emerging technology. A good way to look at it is they're all legs of the same stool, and you really can't have one of those legs missing because then the stool becomes unstable. I agree completely. That's fascinating. So what are some of the new R&D ideas that you have come across that have excited you as an investor? You know, the good thing is there are a lot of people in a lot of countries now pushing this, you know, in the old days, when I say old, you know, 20, 30, 50 years ago, you basically thought of technology as coming from a small handful of countries. That was the U.S. It was Europe. And even within Europe, you probably thought of it as France, Germany, maybe Scandinavia. But today technology has democratized. You have very interesting technologies and business models coming from literally all four corners of the world. It's not just the U.S. It's now obviously China, which is a leader in many of the clean tech technologies. You have places like Korea, Japan, India, even little Estonia is very strong in digital technology. So lots of stuff happening all over the world. That's the good thing. Some very interesting technologies ranging from, you know, high efficiency electrolyzers, small ball rigid reactors. What I'm also excited about is new geothermal, the new generation of geothermal, which doesn't really rely exclusively on geographic constraints to access it. You don't have to go to the volcanic areas. You can drill in anywhere almost you want. Also fusion. And, you know, fusion is one of those things which could happen tomorrow, could take five years, could take 20 years. One doesn't know. But obviously that's the holy grail for energy. And then I know that, you know, everybody is on the A.I. bandwagon today. But putting aside the chat GPT and using A.I. to write your resumes or write letters or book reports, I've also seen A.I. being used to address some very difficult technology questions. For example, there is a company I'm work, I'm advising called Cosmos Innovation out of Singapore, which is using A.I. to create the most efficient Perovsky tandem solar cells. Without the use of A.I., it would have taken 10 times as much time to do that, because there are millions of permutation combinations of arranging those tandems. But with A.I. and machine learning, they can speed it up 10x. So there's some very exciting stuff happening in the physical sciences and in the hard sciences, leveraging A.I. That's fascinating. That's absolutely fascinating. So in going in that direction a little bit, we know oil and gas is expected to play a dominant role in our energy mix well beyond 2050. Do you think our carbon intensity may stay higher for longer? And should this increase our focus on CCUS and other carbon remediation ideas? You know, it's a very, very difficult question. On the one hand, we do want to reduce fossil fuel usage, mostly because of the carbon emissions. So it's not the fossil fuel, per se, it's the carbon emissions which we are concerned about. We also know that fossil fuel usage will continue for a significant period of time. And there are a whole range of reasons for that, from the existing infrastructure to the fact that it is, you know, in most cases, the most energy dense fuel available out there. You have the Global South, which is emerging, which wants to acquire the lifestyles and the, you know, the way of living of the West, which obviously drives more and more fossil fuel usage. As we also know, you know, electricity usage for the last 20 years or so has been somewhat stable. But now people are predicting pretty significant rise in the use of electricity, mostly driven by three things. One is the use of AI, because large language models for the learning part need significant usage of energy. There are some data centers which actually use one gigawatt of energy. I mean, it just blows my mind to know that a data center's electricity bill is close to a billion dollars. I mean, that's the level of energy they use. It's because of EV charging. It's because of reshoring of manufacturing facilities. So electricity usage is predicted to go up very high. The problem is, you know, in as much as the Amazons and the Facebooks and the Microsofts would like to use renewable energy for that, there is a limit to how much they can do that. It's a combination of availability of these resources. It's the inability to access the grid. You know, are there enough transformers, et cetera? So to some extent, we're going to have to use fossil fuels for that as well, whether it's natural gas or other things. So the best way to do this is for the oil and gas companies to do the following. One, ensure that they focus more on low carbon intensity or low sulfur production in areas like that. Obviously, CCUS will play a big role. I know CCUS is a controversial subject, but I think it's a very important lever in our arsenal. If there are industries which are hard to obey, there are industries which can't use electricity because let's take steel, for example, it's very difficult. You need 800 degrees Fahrenheit or centigrade to melt steel. You know, you don't have any resistant material which can reach that level of electricity. So maybe hydrogen can be used. But long story short, you do need to rely on fossil fuels and therefore carbon capture, whether it's at point source, whether it is direct air capture, will and should play an increasing role. And that's where the oil and gas companies can step up. They have the technology. They have the ability to inject the carbon back into the geological areas or reuse them. So there is a lot oil and gas companies can do. I agree completely. This is such an exciting time. So, all right, Girish, let's get back to our conversation after that little intermission. How fast are climate tech investments growing? And I'm going to do a follow on with this one because you and I were talking earlier about climate tech investment 1.0, climate tech investment 2.0. If you want to talk about that distinction as well, I think our audience would benefit. Thank you, Scott. I think your question is really linked to climate 1.0 and 2.0. For people who don't know, we refer to climate 1.0 as the period after 2008, 2009 when the dot com bubble burst. And a lot of VCs were looking for the next big thing. And so they all decided that the next big thing was going to be cleantech. And in many cases, a lot of people called the smart grid would be the next big thing. And people like Cisco said the smart grid would actually be even bigger than the Internet. So a lot of investors moved into cleantech and a lot of entrepreneurs moved into cleantech. That was the good news. The bad news was a couple of things. One is those were the early days. So there was a significant amount of learning which had to happen because, as we know, knowledge builds upon itself. And the early days of chemistry or physics or any technology are the most difficult ones in terms of the percentage of success for all your experiments. But the other fact, which I unfortunately see happening again, is a lot of the VCs who jumped in did not really bring any background in energy or cleantech. And it's one thing where you're funding a software company where, let's say, if you're six months behind, you just add more engineers. You can't do that in cleantech. You know, there is a whole issue around infrastructure. And let's say you're doing biofuels or you're doing fuels based on certain bacteria. You can't just rush the bacteria and say, hey, you're behind time. Let's add some more bacteria or whatever. These things take their own time. So cleantech 1.0, we refer to the period where almost all VC firms lost money in their investments, mostly because these investments took much longer and much more capital than people had anticipated. And so for a long time, there was a certain, I would say, cleantech investing winter where people stepped away from the cleantech space. And then it picked up again about five years ago where large companies and VCs once again came back into the cleantech space. So to answer your question, as of now, there are way many, many, many startups and there are lots and lots of VCs jumping in. My concern is in as much as a lot of these people bring the passion and the energy and the desire to fix it, once again, I'm seeing lots of people jump in with not very deep experience in energy or what it takes to scale a business or what it takes to drive the infrastructure changes, et cetera. So my fear is, are we going to face, are we going to watch the same movie all over again and then create a sort of investment winter all over again? So that's my big worry. I think that's, Girish, I think that's completely valid. And as we discussed in a prior conversation, as you said, the scale and the timing of energy projects is considerably greater and longer than I suspect what investors are accustomed to working with. I know that the project management positions that I've been involved in and working with established clients versus new developers, just that recognition that the established clients, they're sophisticated, they're savvy, they know these projects are years in the making and billions in the investing. And yet the new developers want understandably coming out of the world that they do. They want to have their money back as quickly as possible and see that return. But it doesn't work that way in our world. It takes a long time to get those investments all the way through the pipeline. So, if I may, you touched on these issues and we touched on CCUS, et cetera, and you are obviously very active in the CCUS space. I'm just curious, how do you see this growing? What do you see as the hurdles, you know, whether it's a technical, regulatory or any other challenges, because that's a very important subject. It is. It is. And there are, so I see two components that aren't necessarily understood by numbers people right off the bat. Number one is the social license to operate. We need to be in constant conversation with the people that we are serving. And that includes local city councils, county commissioners, state legislators, the people who are the boots on the ground. They are not the top of the ticket when it comes to the ballots. They're closer to the bottom. And yet that closer to the bottom is really what drives a lot of legislation that can govern what we do as members of the oil and gas industry, including CCUS. And so making certain that we have the education out, the relationships developed. LBJ had a saying that I absolutely loved. You don't build a relationship the day you need it. And he's absolutely right in order to have that trusting relationship in the communities where we operate. It needs to be it needs to be a long term one. And it needs to be something that we as an industry invest in. I also think that we need to start as an industry investing more in the workforce development, starting way back, not just in college with internships, not even just in high school and science fairs, but all the way back in middle school. Because people don't understand the value of STEM education and they don't understand where our energy comes from or how the system works. And so whether it's an oil and gas girl like myself, right, I'm a petroleum engineer or somebody who knows how the electrical grid works. We're just we're simply not getting students through the pipeline like we need to. And and so that's why I'll do a shameless plug for my book. I wrote STEM study habits because I want kids to get into STEM and stay there. And we as an industry need to invest in in this this energy education, if you will. So people actually understand where it comes from and what it takes to put on the the amount of electricity on the grid that we need. If if we're going to have the technologically advanced society and civilization that we plan to have. So thank you. Thank you for passing that ball back to me. That was fascinating. Absolutely. So we've had we've had some questions come in. Do you want me to jump over to those and maybe so? Absolutely. OK, so the first one comes in from and forgive me, audience, if I totally butcher your name, OK, just please chalk it up to an experience. So from John DeWard on Energy Stream, his question is, will a large growth in electrification be limited by the grid capabilities or will this barrier be overcome in a reasonable amount of time? What do you think, Gierish? Unfortunately, at least in the U.S., it is a major problem. There are significant issues around permitting. There are significant issues around putting transmission lines, all of which is leading to congestion on the grid. And you can have your solar power plant be up and ready, but it takes you a good three, four years, depending upon where you are to get access to the grid. Now, if you are a, you know, an industry which needs electricity or if you're a data center, you can do it behind the meter electrification program. You don't have to worry about the grid. But if you are somebody who wants to feed it in the grid, that is a significant challenge. The interesting part, which I learned a couple of years ago because I'm on the board of some other companies there is in India, they actually have a single unified grid. They don't have it broken down into regions like the U.S. So if you want to set up a renewable plant for your factory or for whatever reason, you don't have to set it up near the load. You can set it wherever the environment is the best for your wind or solar plant. And you can feed your electricity into anywhere in the grid in India and pull it out anywhere else, which I thought is something we really should be doing or all countries should be doing. Agreed. I think that's that's a great idea. Thank you for that, Gheerish. OK, the next question is from Hitesh Mohan on LinkedIn. What about critical minerals? How will DLE or direct lithium extraction from produced water and brine play a role in meeting minerals demand and ESG roles? Again, a very important question. As you know, lots, you know, we talk of electrification as the first lever to pull for decarbonization. The issue is you need lots of metals for that. You need copper wires. You need lithium batteries to address the intermittency. You need to have lots of other minerals for building transformers, et cetera. And the problem with that is two things. One is a political issue, which is a large part of these rare earths, minerals, et cetera, are found in countries which may or may not be friendly with the U.S. Take lithium, for example, although it's found in many parts of the world, most of the lithium factories are out in China. But the other problem, which is around ESG is as I'm sure we have seen articles about lithium factories leaching, I mean, sorry, lithium mines in Indonesia or other places. They have pretty significant biodiversity impacts. And I sort of I worry about the long term implications because in as much as climate changed has sort of sucked most of the oxygen from the room, most people, many people believe that biodiversity is a similar, if not a larger problem. And biodiversity has a direct impact on our food supply chain and for man to be able to survive or feed himself. And so if we don't focus on biodiversity, that will also come back to haunt us sooner rather than later. Fascinating. And that's that's something certainly worth considering, especially as we are juggling competing priorities, which every if everything's important, nothing's important, but we certainly don't want to leave anything on the table that, as you say, in the future could come back and affect. Well, not just us as the human race, but the entire planet. So a lot to a lot to keep in mind as we as we try to solve these collective problems. The next question comes from Osmat Gurani on LinkedIn. How long will it take the transition phase towards what we can say renewable energy or a collaborative approach takes? So how long how long will the energy transition phase take toward the renewable energy or the collaborative approach? Do you have a line of sight on how long? Yeah, you know, we already so so renewable energy obviously is something a lot of people are driving towards, but we already touched on some of the barriers to, you know, whether it's the grid congestion, whether it's the access to minerals in a timely manner, et cetera. I'm not entirely sure what Osmat means about collaborative by him assuming he means a collaboration between the fossil fuel and the non fossil fuel industry. You know, the if that's what he means, I would say the oil and gas industry has a very, very strong role to play. As I mentioned before, it's not just in CC US, but it's in leveraging their own skills, whether it's in the geophysics sciences or whether it's in drilling, et cetera. I think the oil and gas industry can play a significant role in the new geothermal. It can play a significant role in offshore wind. It can play a significant role in in in floating wind. They bring all the project management skills, all the deep sea skills, et cetera. So if that's what Osmat means by collaboration, I think there are companies out there, whether it's Petronas, whether it's total energies, and to some extent Shell and BP are already moving in that direction. That's fantastic. That's really exciting. The next question comes from Ellen at is a bar on LinkedIn. How can we support the average older workforce, particularly those without a specialization in this area in actively participating in the energy transition? You know, it really depends upon what skill levels you have and what skill levels you want to acquire. So whether you're talking about, you know, an energy transition is anyway from utility scale solar projects to even rooftop solar to community solar. So there are areas you can participate. It doesn't have to be in research or engineering. It can be in sales. It can be in lobbying. It can be in talking to your or, you know, being part of a group which which lobbies cities and towns and counties on setting up community solar, things like that. So there are lots of areas you can play, you know, depending upon your desire to, you know, which sector you want to play in and your level of technical or other skills. Fantastic. Well, I think we're coming up on the end of our talk here for the S.P.E. live event in discussing all things fascinating with with tech investment and achieving net zero. Girish, if you have a few final thoughts, would you like to share them with our audience? Thank you, Skylar. I think there was one question on. I think Agarwal asked about advice to graduating students interested in working on decarbonization. You know, my suggestion would be find a sector you're interested in solar geothermal, whatever, start either start working for a large company so that you can get the experience in project management and complex projects, et cetera, or start working for a startup. And once you have learned what it takes for a startup to survive, to scale, et cetera, then you can take your skills in many other areas, whether you want to stay in the business or start your own startup or reach out to a VC firm, et cetera. But I think this the whole climate issue and the, you know, we talked about the ecosystem, et cetera. These are existential issues for us. This is not just about solving world poverty. And so we all need to jump in and help as much as we can. Fantastic. Well, Girish, this has just been a fantastic conversation. I've enjoyed it enormously. Thank you for thank you for accommodating me and all of my questions. Ladies and gentlemen, we really appreciate you joining us this morning. Some fantastic questions. If you have anything else that you'd like to discuss, by all means, let us know. And with that, I'll say wonderful to have you this morning and we will see you next time. Thank you so much.

How Gyroscopes Impact Wellbore Surveying with Adri√°n Ledroz,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to the SPE Live Technical Director Series, shared challenges and technologies for maximizing the value and life of completions. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on May 15th, 2023. And now your moderator, Bob Pearson. Good day, everybody. Welcome to this SPE Live Technical Director Series on the shared completions and production challenges and the technologies for maximizing the value and life of completions. My name is Bob Pearson. I'm an independent petroleum engineering consultant and a former technical director. I'll be your moderator and representative in the discussions today. The session will last about 30 minutes, and we encourage you to post your questions into the chat during the program. It's now my pleasure to introduce Karen Olson, the current TD for Completions. She is a senior completions advisor with Welldata Labs, as well as being an independent consultant. She was previously the technology director for Southwestern Energy and has worked in completions and reservoir engineering for more than 37 years. She started her career as a fracturing engineer with the Western Company and then went on to work with Holdetsch & Associates, Mobile and BP before joining Southwest Energy. The other panelist is Hamed Al-Murray, the current TD for Production and Facilities. He's been an active SPE member for nearly 20 years. Hamed began his career as an apprentice with Chevron before joining Saudi Aramco in 1991. He is currently the production and facilities development director for Saudi Aramco. Over the last 30 years, Hamed has worked in production, reservoir management, drilling and facilities. Karen and Hamed, welcome to ESB Live. Oh, thank you, Bob. It's good to see you. It's nice to see you too. Yeah, thank you. Good to see you too. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Natalie, behind the scene. And I'm glad to be with Karen and all the listeners today and SPE members. Thank you. So I'd like to start off today's discussion with a couple of questions about re-stimulations. Hamed, can you kick us off about talking about candidate selection or maybe even deselecting high-risk candidates? OK, thank you. Thank you, Bob. I would like to start first with the objective of the stimulation of the frac cells, mainly to boost the production by increasing the reservoir contact either by the new entry points, new pervs, or rely on the frac orientation to the existing perfor ports, enhance the frac conductivity, placing the propant previously unpropped fractures, or energizing the natural frac fissures. Now, in order to identify the good candidates, they have to have a certain characteristics that will encourage the designers to go and pick them up. Now, long spacing between the stages of previous frac, the roll of thumb is to be more than 300 feet in between. The initial frac of low performance, do either to frac fluid or inadequate prop volume, or natural frac presence nearby, also underperforming walls when you compare it to the offset walls, and sometimes for low, because of low operational risk. Now, if we look to the other side, the bad candidates, how we can identify the bad candidates or the high-risk candidates, we'll find that usually they're the ones in depleted or limited low-pressure reservoir, the ones that they have had throughout the development of the fields or the placement of the well, well integrity issues due to corrosion, erosion, casing deformation, or issues with the cement integrity, which usually at well include risking the refrac by casing damage. Also, you need to look to the production decline in the offset walls and can give you a good indication of the bad candidates before you pick them. Nearby water contact is also one of the signs, especially if you have this information, whether you're refracking gas wells or an oil wells. Karen, can I maybe pick up across it, pass it across to you as how you see it as a fracturing specialist, how you view refracturing? Yeah, thanks, Bob. Well, I think Hamad, he covered so many items that I fully agree with. I would probably emphasize, and the one thing I'd emphasize is looking for old completions styles. Well, so wells that were completed years ago, and my background for the last 10 plus years has been unconventional, so I'm going to be primarily thinking in my mind, long horizontal wells with multi-stage fracks in them. And if you just go back a few years, a lot of the clusters were spaced 30, 50, say around 50 feet between each other. And currently, most companies are fracking in the 15, maybe up to 30 feet at most. And so you're looking for those wide cluster spacing, old completion designs. And then also, like Hamad said, you want to look to see how did the well perform compared to other wells around it. It could also be used, maybe they used a different frac fluid. If you go back far enough, maybe they're using still cross-link or thicker fluids versus the slick water to look at. For the wells to be careful of, the one big thing you've got to be careful of, at least for re-fracks, is being able to re-enter these horizontals. And so one of the things you should do is go and look at their original treating pressures, make sure you don't see were there any plug slippage or casing deformation signs. Maybe when they drilled the plugs out, where they had some sticking points or something like that. So you just want to be careful. I know in the last few years, I think it's gotten better, but we have had a bunch of casing deformation issues, a lot of plug issues where sand erosion around the plug has actually eaten the casing away. So we have some well integrity issues. There's been a lot of re-fracks, I would say, in the Eagleford Shale. And what seems to be working down there is people are literally just running a new liner in the lateral section and cementing it. So for example, if you set the well to set up, that's the other thing is what's your casing size. If it was ran with, say, five and a half inch casing, you can then go in and run a four inch liner and cement it in place. And they've had excellent success. I know both Devin and ConocoPhillips have done quite a few down there and they're seeing huge uplifts. I mean, wells that are making 10, 30 barrels a day, going up to over a thousand barrels a day after they do these re-stimulations. So the economics, I think, are there for them if you set them up properly. Thank you. Thank you. It makes sense for me to maybe look at re-cementing a liner. That brings me across to a sort of related issue on well integrity. One of the things that worries me with initial fracturing and refracturing is just the quality of the cement on the production liner. Harmeet, do you want to comment on that? You know, I agree with you, Bob. During the frack, if we have an issue, now we need to go back to the cement quality during the drilling times. If we have now what could be a weak cement behind the casing or as channels that were developed during the cement job during the drillings. Now, once we have a frack operation, what could be a CCA, casing to casing analysis, which is normally it's hard to fix. And this is one of the areas any drillers that they will have to watch, especially if they know that this will be fract. That they need to pay more attention to all the solutions from the cement type that they will be using, from the practices that they will exercise during the drilling time to ensure that they do not have an issue with the cement. And sometimes even if they anticipate that they might have an issue with the cement, it's maybe to use a cement retainer in order to enhance the cement quality behind the casing and to prevent what could be a breach into the cement and a damage that sometimes irreversible. And you could lose your well, you know, if you frack it and you end up with a high CCA and the back size of the well that could cause risk to the surrounding areas or nearby communities. Yeah. Yeah. Karen, I think that the well integrity technical section and the fracturing technical section have all been doing quite a bit of work in this space. Do you want to talk about that a little? Yeah. So there is a well integrity technical work group and they've been working really hard. They're actually putting together a database to try to identify, you know, what are the key issues of causing these well integrity issues, you know, where we're having casing deformation. This is something that Martin Rylance and George King and some others have been working on. They are having, too, a technical section or session at ATCE in San Antonio this year to talk about that specifically. So I think it would be good for everybody to listen to. They're also looking for, they're coming up with common terminology, something as simple as just, you know, making sure everybody's on the same page when they're saying, you know, casing deformation, what does that mean, for example. But, you know, having a good cement job along the lateral is so critical when you're doing these horizontal wells. And you're going to be, if you're fracking and you're putting perforations every 15, 20 feet apart, you better have a good cement job. Otherwise, it's just sort of pointless in a way. You know, otherwise you'll create superfracts or reconnect with the previous stage. And now all of a sudden you've got fracks going two pads away, for example, and draining parts of the reservoir that you don't want it to and leaving other parts undrained. So, I mean, there are some best practices that the well integrity group have come up with, like reciprocating the casing and rotating it during the cement job they found to seem to work, seems to work quite well. But yeah, well integrity is so important. And I've been looking at for the last couple of years, thousands of stages during them, working for well data labs and doing sealed well bore pressure monitoring. And I will say in the most part, the companies are getting so much better, you know, because I can tell if a well has a bad cement job, or if there's a near fault or something like that. But, you know, just by how fast a frack comes in contact with that offset, you know, sealed well bore. And it doesn't happen as much as it used to. So I think the word's getting out. And it's getting better, which is good. And so a sort of related topic to this is looking at how we can utilize existing well bores and existing facilities for carbon capture utilization or carbon capture and sequestration. I'd like to ask both of you about your thoughts on where the challenges lie, and maybe where we need some more R&D for that matter, as we move into something completely new. So, Hamid, maybe you can kick us off. You know, what we need to start with is how we want to look to the CCS completion first, since whether we want to develop a new structure or use an existing assets and repurpose them for the sake of this, you know, carbon capture storage objectives. Now we need to ensure go and check the reservoir characterizations. Now for the fundamental capacity and the properties of the rock, the fluids and potential interaction with the CO2, this one. Now, understanding its capacity to capture the CO2, then to verify the integrity of its sealing and confinement to prevent what could be an issue of leakage of the CO2s and the loss of your storage integrity. Now this will help to anticipate the operating envelope itself by knowing the injection, the shut-in pressure, the temperature at both the surface and down-hole. Now knowing the fluid properties and the partial pressure of the CO2 and H2S will help also in the material selections for the completion itself. Now, I understand that sometimes simpler is better, and by minimizing the completion components, the materials taken into account, and maybe if we have a completion of carbon steel that can help. Now we've got to be careful. We've got to make sure that since the CCS business is picking up, we'll have to make sure that by designing the CCS wells and storage structures themselves, we'll have to make sure that we increase the chance of success by doing everything to near, if I would, near perfection in order to prevent any incident at this stage that could stigmatize the CCS business. Now this will depend also, we'll have to be careful about the exposure by selecting the location, the fluid properties based on the selection to optimize the cost itself. Also, we want to make sure that we do not exceed the limits in terms of cost. One of the areas that we'll have to make sure, whether it's existing assets or new assets, we'll have to ensure that we equip the wells with monitoring means, be it HMS, temperature sensors, in order to fiber optics, if you would, surface and down-hole, and if we can do even real-time, that's required to build the productive models. Now, if some of you have new wells, maybe we can even lean to more strong metallurgies like the CRA or GRE materials as commonly used to minimize the corrosion, especially if we know that there is also H2S presence in the reservoir or in the fluid that we will be storing. Thank you. Good overview of all the concerns. Karen, I don't know whether you can comment on this, but for those of us living and working overseas, it's a bit confusing looking at the US. The EPA has a different designation of class 6 wells for CCS and class 4 wells for CCUS. Could you comment on that a little bit, or is that outside your expertise? I can comment on it a little bit, Bob. The EPA has what they call class 6 for CCUS injection wells, which are very much more stringent than class 4 in terms of you have to make sure that you can prove that you got, as Mod said, a seal to contain your CO2 and the horizon you're injecting it into. You have to be able to monitor the plume and show where it's going. And so there's been field trials going on where people are doing seismic, multiple seismic to try to show where the CO2 is moving in the subsurface, especially if you're in a carbonate. It's not homogeneous or anything like that. And then you have to monitor, as Mod said, temperatures and your casing pressures. And so it's very strict. One thing that I'd like to say, though, is we've been, at least in the States, we haven't necessarily been doing CCUS just to store CO2, but we have been doing CO2 EORs since the early 1990s successfully in existing oil fields. When I worked for Mobile out in the Permian, we were injecting for EOR purposes very successfully, like in the Slaughter field, Salt Creek field. The thing you have to be careful, though, is you can build all these models you want, but you never can really capture the heterogeneity that you see. For example, I remember Salt Creek, all the modeling that was done ahead of time said we wouldn't see a breakthrough to the first producer for six months. And so the facilities thought they had extra time to get all the facilities ready when we actually saw a breakthrough in six weeks. And it was just because there may be those stray stringers and all of a sudden, CO2 being a gas, it's going to go where it wants to go. And it just zipped on across and showed up. And next thing you know, we're shutting in a bunch of producers because the facilities weren't ready. So I think we do need to come up with better monitoring and new technologies for the CCUS. Hamad mentioned fiber optics. I think fiber optics could be a good one. The other thing that I'm concerned about in existing fields is, you know, you're going to do your best for all these new wells, for your injection wells, but what if you have existing vertical wells all over the place? You better get a baseline across your whole field and monitor all these other existing well bores that could be across the field to make sure that you don't have any well integrity issues in those. That's my biggest concern in doing CCUS these days and in old fields. So. Yeah, I think the the new P&A technical section is going to be doing some stuff together with the CCUS technical section around exactly that. How do we properly abandon the existing penetrations to allow CCUS? Yeah, right. Our water zones on there. Can I lead you back to fracturing from it? We've got a couple of interesting questions from the audience. Pierre-Edouard Vincent was asking about in the primary cementing of long liners, what percentage of wells do you think use advanced slurry placement models to refine these practices? That's a good question and Pierre, I don't really know. I'd have to ask our drilling TD Robin on that one. I just know in my previous role as technical director at Southwestern Energy, we had just learned from best practices of reciprocating casing and rotating the casing strain wall we were cementing and making sure that we had returns all the way back to surface. I don't think we ran any fancy software to do it though. I don't know, Hamad, how about yourself over in the kingdom? Are you aware of them, the drilling, doing any fancy slurry software? I know that it's exactly the same practices that you just highlighted, Karen. We're doing the same, especially when we need to simulate of course the trajectories, especially when we know that there could be a washout during the placement of the laterals because if you do not plan well your laterals and you do the cementing, you might end up with a weak spot that during the fracking could cause a deformation of the lateral. Actually just looking at a well exactly like that, as you say, Hamad, the tortuousness of the well path meant they couldn't rotate when they planned to. So they ended up with a poorer cement job than they expected because they didn't have enough torque to be able to rotate the pipe. Some of the latest ideas for drilling is these U-shaped wells. I don't know how that would impact the torque and being able to rotate the casing for these companies, which I think is a cool idea. Don't get me wrong. I actually have this vision of a U-shaped well with the second part of the U, the toe section of it being a slotted liner and then fracking and hitting it, fracking the first part of the U and hitting the slotted liner part of the U. So drilling doesn't like me right now, but those would be critical too on there. So it's a great question. Thanks for that. I've worked on a couple of U-shaped wells in conventional applications. It's great in some conventional applications, but indeed it really needs a fully integrated well engineering team. What I've typically seen is models and everything will be run on maybe the first well. When you go to do something new, like say all of a sudden you're going from 10,000 foot laterals to 15,000 foot laterals, they'll run some model software to double check everything. And then if they successfully do it, then they don't run any models after that. Yeah. And that maybe leads nicely to Pierre-Edouard's second question, which is relating to risk-based analysis and management for working in well engineering. Do you want to comment on that in a general sense, Hamid? Hamid El-Khattab Now, let me just, yeah, you know, mainly we need to understand now the risks of dealing with the CCS. Now, the objective of the CCS is to ensure that we maintain the confinement of the CO2 downhole for a long life of the storage. So, you know, and this should start, you know, in early, during the design phase and the selection of the structure itself to ensure that it's very well sealed. And we need to drill the wells, to drill the wells with all the accessories in the wells, that they will be very durable to live long throughout the life cycle of the fields. And now we'll have also to make sure that even during the operations at the surface or during the life of the wells that there is no, you know, chance, even slim chance of any well integrity. And the wells that could lead to the seeping or the leakage of the CO2s to either shallower aquifers or even to behind the casing to the surface to the extreme cases. So, the selection of the completion metallurgy is very important for the durability of the wells. The location itself of the surface spot or the placement of the wells is very important to be far away and in a very safe areas away from even the populated communities. So, now we need to select the locations, the spot itself where we will place our wells. We need to ensure that we have a stringent design for the completion itself. It could be more expensive than the normal wells, but it's worth it because this will be a long life investment for the CO2. The monitoring, of course, so even if it requires to go with intelligent completions to keep monitoring the wells throughout the injections and the reservoirs, silvers of pressures, this would be even a cherry on the back on the cake. Unfortunately, a lot of good questions here, but we're running out of time. So, Karen, do you want to maybe close out with just a quick comment on risk-based design and then your closing thoughts and we'll come back to Hamid for his closing thoughts. Maybe two minutes each. KAREN SUTTER Okay. Thank you, Bob. So, one of the things I learned when I was working in deep water and you have these big important projects that are new and you don't necessarily know all the risks that could happen is we would always do like a MARS or a major risk assessment and we'd have a group of 10, 12 engineers and we would just try to identify every risk that could occur, both short-term and long-term, and then what were the possible ways to reduce that risk or eliminate that risk. And the thing about it is, you know, you have to address, anytime a risk would be brought out, you have to address it. You can't just let somebody say, oh, no, that's not a big deal. You have to come up with how are you going to address it. For example, you know, somebody could say, oh, well, how are you going to prevent, you know, CO2 coming up the backside of your case? And we'd have to come up with at least two solutions to that risk. Or how are we going to prevent? I see somebody said, what are the legal liabilities on there? It's like one of the best things from a legal perspective, and this is just my opinion on this, of course, is to get that baseline and understand what you're starting with, what's your starting point across the whole field. So that means collecting samples from all any water wells or having a water wells that you can monitor and get good solid baselines. And then you do your very best to make sure that you've set this up for success, as Ahmad said, and success for the long term, not just to be able to prove that you can inject, you know, CO2. In closing, I think we've got a great industry. I love working in the oil field. And I think everybody, you know, in their heart is trying to do their very best when it comes to, you know, completing and producing these oil and gas wells. And then we're also leading into other, helping other technologies, the CCUS. We didn't touch on geothermal, but, you know, geothermal is, we're helping the geothermal group, for example, we're helping, there's a Utah Forge out in Utah that we're helping, you know, taking oil and gas technology to the geothermal group. Did you know that they never pump prop it when they frack a geothermal well? And here we are from oil and gas going, no, no, no, you got to pump prop it, something as simple as that. I would like to also let everybody know that abstracts for the hydraulic fracturing conference is open right now. So now's your chance to write that abstract and submit it. And this is for the HFTC that's in the woodlands every year in February. And then we also have an international hydraulic fracturing conference in Muscat, Oman, and coming up real soon is September 12th to the 14th, which I'll be there for that. And this will be our third year to hold it there. And it's a wonderful event. We have papers from all over the world being presented there. So it's a great one. And oh, there is a geothermal workshop in August down in Galveston. So anybody interested to see what we're doing from the oil and gas perspective for geothermal, I'll be there for that one as well. So Baba, thank you. And thanks. Thank you very much. Two minutes. We will take that liberty that they gave us of running over by five minutes. So two minutes for you, Harmad, to close it out. Okay. Thank you, Bob. Just I want to recap a quick, we talked about the simulations and this is one of the means to maximize the value of any operator's assets. We need to leverage the technologies that we have in hand in order to increase the chance of the success of the re-stimulations. We need also to get into the micro-size, the production log, do the VTAs, and utilize the tracers, the technologies, the fiber optics to help us maximize the value of our assets. We talked about the oil integrities. Also, we need always to make sure that both, all the entities working on the designing of the wells to pay more attention to the cement operations to deliver the wells with the least chance of oil integrities and loss on the operators and the investments. We also, we talk about the CCS, the CCS of potential. We need to educate ourselves more and to ensure that we go with the designs today. Since this is now worldwide, will be one of the first batch of the CCS. We need to invest lavishly, if you would, in order to make sure that we reduce the chance of any failures to the minimum in order not to lose the image of the industry. We have enough. And we have, and I encourage, of course, our colleagues and SBEs to take advantage of all the technical sections that we have. It's in SBEs, hydrogen, we have the hydrogen, we have the PNA, and newly born technical sections with a lot of potential. And you know that we have a lot of great topics that we're discussing in the NPA, and we need to capitalize on this experience. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Karen, for giving me the chance to be with you today and with the audiences. Back to you. Yeah, thank you both for your time and your thoughts. Great session. We could go on for a long time, but unfortunately, we've only got 30 minutes. We overrun it by our 10%. So what can I say? Except thank you and see you soon. Thank you. Yep. Thank you, Bob."

You're listening to SPE Live, how technology and innovation drive unconventional resources development. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on May 24th, 2023. And now your moderator, Alex Valdez-Pérez. Hello, everyone. Welcome to this SPE Live on how technology and innovation drive unconventional resources development. My name is Alex Valdez-Pérez. I am a technical developer for Kappa Engineering and SPE Reservoir Advisory Committee member. I will be the moderator for today. Today's program is estimated to last 30 minutes, and we encourage our viewers to send questions to our panelists. Before we introduce our guests, I would like to invite you to the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, which will be held in Denver next month. It is, well, the largest conference regarding unconventionals. So now it is my great pleasure to introduce our guests. Our first guest is Johannes Alvarez. Johannes is the EOR and CO2 advisor in the Mid-Continent Business Unit at Chevron Americas Exploration and Production. He currently serves as the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, SPE co-chair, as the SPE Midland Basis Energy Conference co-chair, and many other positions within the SPE. He is the author of several journal and technical papers on EOR in unconventional reservoirs. He serves as the technical editor for the SPE journals. Our second panelist is Scott Singleton. Scott works for Nexttrain Energy as a reservoir geophysicist in the Eagle Fort ASAP. He is the SCG technical co-chair for ERTIC. Scott has 35 years of experience in the oil industry, spanning from offshore acquisition as a digital bugger, to seismic processing, interpretation, geophysical reservoir characterization, and shell reservoir geomechanics. For the last 15 years, Scott has been working in an unconventional resource place. Our third guest is Katerina Yared. Katerina is a senior petrophysicist at SM Energy located in Denver. Before joining SM Energy, Katerina worked for Key P Resources, Apache Corporation, and Neon's Resolution as a petrophysicist. She is a certified professional geologist in the state of Texas and a certified project management professional by the Project Management Institute. In addition, Katerina has been selected to participate in the cohort of the 2023 Energy Development Program from the Energy Leadership Institute. Johannes Scott Katerina, welcome to this SPE Live. So before we jump into the meeting, Johannes, would you like to give us some opening words? Sure, Ale, thank you. Thank you, everybody. Welcome. Thank you for being here with us. This is simple. We just want to talk to you about unconventionals. And before we go into the details, we just want to let you know the importance, right? Why are we doing this? Why would tech? And why are our countries actually developing these resources for many years? If we put just the US, the United States, the production of oil right now for the United States, two-thirds of it comes from unconventional reservoirs. This has put the US on the top oil and gas producer due to unconventionals. And actually, it's expected that our production will increase even more than 12 million barrels per day this year and in 2024, 12.8 million barrels per day. That's incredible based on the fact that we were producing less than 5 million 15 years ago. And there is a huge peak that is basically driven by unconventionals. And not only by unconventionals, but the technology that we have that actually drives this growth, this development. If we put just the Permian Basin aside, in 2027, this basin will produce 7 million barrels a day of oil. This is incredible compared to what actually we're producing right now. This also puts the US on the export charts right now. We're exporting a new record, 3.6 million barrels per day last year. And we've seen the last decades basically how that deflection point has changed the production. Not only the US, but many other countries are actually using unconventional reservoirs, especially in America. In addition, unconventional reservoirs give you very low-carburetor barrels. The average is 12 to 14 oxygen emission intensity of 12 to 14 kilograms of CO2 per BOOE. That's very low compared with other asset class in the industry. Also, if we talk about economics, we invest the EIA, or International Energy Agency, estimates that $26 trillion would be invested from 2021 to 2015 in the oil and gas sector. And North America, because of the growth of unconventional, will take 30% of that chunk. It's like almost $8 trillion of investment that we're going to have in the next couple decades. Due to the predominant low-cost resource, the base predominant that we have here in the US, and basically how we actually can produce these unconventional reservoirs in a fast-paced, in a standardized space. And everything that I just described before is being accomplished by the use of technology. We have horizontal drilling and fracturing. We standardize what we're doing. We have longer laterals. We have path development. We have single-stranded fracturing, just to mention a few things. Today, you will hear more about that in many other areas of our expertise. So welcome, and let's begin the show. Thank you very much. Back to you, Alex. Well, thank you, Johannes, for your words and the overview on unconventionals. So I would like to start this live with a question to Katerina. So given your expertise, how has geomechanics evolved with the advent of unconventionals? Yeah, geomechanics is actually one of the disciplines that really grew within the unconventional room of our unconventional reservoir rooms. It is something that got developed more and more over the years, moving from a very isotropic aspect of geomechanics into an anisotropic aspect of geomechanics was key to identifying the components that are key to the extraction of hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs. For that, a lot had to go into the analysis of geomechanics in terms of understanding compartmentalization. That's a difficult word to say, but understanding how our fracks, that's what unconventional, like Johannes mentioned, it's a part of how the success came about for unconventional reservoirs, is understanding the energy, the frac energy, how far it will reach, how far it can produce pathways for hydrocarbons to flow out of your wells, as well as how much you influence your production of neighboring wells, especially with lateral wells and the child-parent relationships to wells. All of this, geomechanics plays a critical role. And going back to the basics of geomechanics, these had to be advanced and further understood to be able to really successfully successfully produce out of our unconventional reservoirs. So I would say geomechanics, if it's not the key, it's one of the keys necessary to success in unconventional reservoirs. Thank you, Katerina, for your answer. So my second question is for Scott. In your experience, how has geophysical reservoir characterization changed with unconventionals? Thanks for that question, Alex. And I just want to say it's a thrill to be here talking with everybody. This is a great forum. ERTEC, the integrated platform, is dear to all of our hearts. And this question is pretty relevant to the whole thing. So if we go back a little bit to conventional reservoir characterization, well, as far as geophysics, geology, G&G in general, we got the big three. You have lithology, you have porosity, and you have fluid content. All efforts were devoted to quantifying those things. So what happened when shales came along? Well, when shales came along, we realized that some of these things don't matter, because you're talking about small porosity, very small permeability. And the lithology is mostly known as mud rocks. So we do pay attention to lithology now. And mostly it's a carbonate to shale spectrum, and we try to quantify the difference between those two. But instead of the other two components, we spend our time trying to quantify mechanical properties, because that's what matters for fracking the reservoir. So those mechanical properties are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. So we can determine those things from well logs, we can determine those things from boreholes, and we can also determine those things from geophysics. And so that's the integration of all those things. Now the final component that I want to add that came into the forefront with unconventionals is fracture characterization. So this is a sort of a sub sub discipline of reservoir characterization. But fracture characterization really didn't have much of a place in conventionals. But in unconventionals, if fractures is the way you're going to produce, then it's very, very, very important. And perhaps later in this segment right here, I'll describe what fracture characterization really consists of. Katarina started mentioning some of that, and I'll continue with that later in the podcast. Thank you, Scott, for your answer. So now I would like to ask Johannes, what new innovations in stimulation like frag and completion have occurred? Thank you, Alex. And you can notice that all our responses are well integrated because this is the nature of this asset class, right? It's integration. And let me start with the very basics, right? The rest of the unconventional reservoirs are created when we stimulate. If we don't stimulate the road, we definitely don't produce them. This is the main difference that we have with conventional reservoirs that they see out of the ground sometimes in the old times, right? This you need to create a reservoir to make it work. And we have gone very long on this. We have longer fracture network, for example, which basically is compounded by longer lateral. So our horizontal wells are being longer, we started with one mile. We are in an average of two, but we have many wells also with three miles and more. We even have U-shaped horizontal wells to try to cover areas that basically just a single straight line doesn't cover. We increase the problem mass, which is the amount of sand that we put when we complete this well, and we practice. We went from 500 pounds per foot to 2500 pounds per foot. We increase the fluid volume as well from 500 gallons per foot to 2500 gallons per foot. And that's all the stuff. We have denser fracture distribution because we don't want only the fracture to be longer and take more space, but we want it to be more dense, right? And the idea of being dense is you can drain more, more the oil and the gas that is actually on the reservoir. Remember, you are creating the reservoir, right? So we went from cluster spacing from 100 feet, cluster spacing to 15 to 20, sometimes 5 to 10 in some tests that we're doing actually in the industry. We have higher stake count. We went from 10 to 40 in average, and we have over range for 80 to 100 stage on average. We have higher pump rates. We were injecting at six barrels per minute. We're now 105 barrels per minute on average score. And we've been even higher, 140, 150 in few cases. And we actually try to have this in limited entry, so having different perforation designs. We have linear delivery as well, fewer additive, low-camp propane instead of bringing that sand from all over the world or different places in the US. We have low-camp surcing, and we believe that that gives good results. And we have efficient operations. We do in some of that, which is basically instead of completing one well, we complete two at the same time, and we can actually make this faster. We have few development, which we can complete several benches at the same time. And not only on that part, but we also increase our technology in the diagnostics and learning. We are using fiber actors to understand the fracture geometry, perforation imaging, solutions that basically give you tracers, interfering tests, seal wells, pressure monitoring, developed by Devin, for example. We have side paths, some consortiums with universities and other companies, machine learning as well. All this together basically brought very good technological changes. And the way, the basic main goal was to minimize our dollars per barrel, trying to make this as economic as possible. And this path for innovation that we have got dramatic reductions in costs and brought more oils. For example, we decreased in all these 15 years of production, we decreased the average cost of the well by 40%. We increased our production in the first year by 140%. We decreased the cost per barrel by almost 80%. Those are significant values that make these barrels economical. And you will see, many of this, there are several sessions in optimization and design, hydraulic fracturing, mitigating and seeing part and child effects, materials that are being used. So it's going to be a good trick during URTEK to see all these technology plays and the collaboration that we have basically on all the specialties. Back to you, Alex. All right. Thank you. Thank you for your answer, Johannes. So I mentioned in the beginning of this slide that URTEK is probably the most important conference regarding to unconventional resources. So how has URTEK affected the concept of discipline integration? Has some conventional strength or weakness the need to integrate it? Katarina, do you want to make a comment on this? I'm glad you will. Yes. Thank you, Alex, for that question. I think URTEK was, you know, 11 years ago when it first took place here in Denver, and it will be back in Denver. So I'm very glad that it's happening again in my hometown. I think the platform was set for companies to realize the fact that interdisciplinary action is required to fully understand and fully produce those unconventional reservoirs. Like Scott and Johannes mentioned, we moved away from the conventional aspect of things because we had to understand the unconventional, the more complex system that we're dealing with, with unconventional reservoirs. And with the integration of multidisciplinary approaches, workflows, and things like that, the different disciplines had to definitely communicate and also build technologies and approaches, like Johannes just listed a few here, on how to better quantify as well as produce from reservoirs that are in these tight shale plates. But it definitely produced, URTEK started the conversation, and with that in place, the technology started to build out of, you know, conversations that multidisciplinary teams started to have. So I believe that URTEK definitely provided a kicking point to those discussions, but also to the innovation that unconventional technology really brought to the light of day here with more and more disciplines being involved. And as we moved on, realizing that even more disciplines need to be part of the discussions from the beginning. Geomechanics, petrophysics, geology, reservoir engineering, and other ones are a great aspect of how URTEK brought them all together, but also what the technologies then that came out of it all really brought more success to shale plates. And also moving from URTEK here in the US, we also have URTEK conferences now in Latin America and in Australia, for example, meaning that the understanding of this powerful platform is definitely required also elsewhere to be able to further add to the reservoir characterization as well as the reservoir exploitation of unconventional reservoirs worldwide. So I definitely think that this platform is something that brought more understanding from disciplines to other disciplines. And with that in place, you know, we're all leading into a common language now that really brings success to unconventional plates. Thank you, Katerina, for that answer. Johanna Soskod, would you like to add anything to this? Nope, that was a great response. I'll find it. Good. Well, the next question is from John Dow, we are linked in. He asks, what level of information in geomechanics along the lateral would naturally change the fracture characterization profile? Scott, would you like to make a comment on this? Yeah, sure. I'd like to change the focus of the question a little bit. The thing with geomechanics is that it is along with what Katerina was just talking about with unconventionals, the ERTEC theme as well as the unconventional profession is integration. And geomechanics exemplifies this. You throw everything into geomechanics and it integrates the whole batch. It integrates engineering. So you throw in the perf spacings, you throw in stage spacings, you throw in all the fluid injection, and then you simulate what response the reservoir has. Now, how do you get that reservoir response? Well, that's the G&G. That's Katerina and myself providing the rock properties that are there, the mechanical properties that I just mentioned before, as well as the fracture properties. And so with all of that, then you simulate what the reservoir is going to provide and then compare what the actual reservoir does provide. So geomechanics is the be-all and end-all. And that's why, in fact, in ERTEC, one of the two or three themes that always has the most papers submitted is geomechanics. So I'll leave the response there. Okay. Thanks a lot, Scott. The next question is from Katerina Martinez. What are the most successful measurements of production after a fracture in the laterals? Does anyone would like to take this one? I can take a stab at that. So thank you, Carolina, for the question. So basically, there are a few things that you could do after you actually produce. Basically, you can have interference tests to understand where actually fluids are going. You can have the geochemistry as well to try to understand the water, where different solidities, different properties are going from different wells on different benches. If you put tracers while you're completing, you basically have a much more better idea of where you can put water tracers or oil tracers. And you can tag how much oil, from where it's coming, depending on different stages. Or you can tag the water in different wells in different stages as well. So there are a bunch of what we call SNOs, surveillance, analysis, and optimization tools that can help you with that. And at the end of the day, also, when you get your production, when you understand your tide curves and everything that you have on your previous wells, you can start getting into what we call the interferon factors and depletion factors. So you can understand a little bit better how much a well should produce based on the fact that it's completed nearby wells that are already depleted, or it's completed in different benches that you can get in production from different benches. So with time and basically with data, you can improve those and refine those factors. But if you're going to do it immediately when you're producing a well, basically, strong SNO light tracers, interferon tests, seal well pressure monitoring as well, that help you with that after. If you want to do that earlier with fiber optics for fracture geometry will help as well. So you can understand how you fragment your well, depending on the completion design. Thank you, Your Highness. We have another question from Carolina Martinez as well. She asks, how did you handle the lack of data over the laterals to improve the geomechanics model? Someone wants to comment on this? I can take that. Yes. Okay. I'm happy to take that. Please. Yeah. Thank you, Carolina, for the question. Nice to see you here. What I would say is that's exactly what, you know, all of us were pointing towards the integration of multidisciplinary aspects and understandings and learnings that we gathered over the years go into what I would call a geomodel space. And from that geomodel space, you can integrate it with seismic as well. There's many avenues for that. But obviously, you require your logs, your information that you get from your pilot holes and things like that, as well as advanced core analysis that with the unconventionals also has developed over the years. And with that, that's something that I alluded to at the beginning, the anisotropic aspect of things, all of that needs to be included into a geomodel space. And from that geomodel space, you can then apply it on the laterals in that geomodel space and understanding how the variability of your models can then differ or change according to your measurement points on which you calibrate your models to. And obviously, there's a lot of emphasis on quality of data, right? And then the quality of the data then leads to the quality of your models. But I think it is something with the data poor lateral data gathering that we're still having these days. It's something that is critical. Geophysics can for sure help you a little bit as well with micro seismic and things like that. But at the end of the day, the model creation is reliant on a lot of hard data like core and other aspects of other, I would say subsurface data points that you can then gather. But if that is in place, an extraction of the models of the mechanical earth models as well as the geological models and the seismic models combined will give you an answer for that. All right. Thanks a lot for your answer, Katerina. So now if you allow me, I would like to ask another question to Johannes. Given your expertise, what is the role of EOR in unconventional reservoirs? It is a very big role. So let me go back and put you where we are right now. Most of this, the shell and tie unconventional resource are producing in single digit recovery factors. And that's understandable. The reason why is because they are being produced by solution guide drive. This is the main mechanism that basically produce unconventional reservoir. So we put this model production, the heavy molecules are basically moved by this solution guide drive. And when we lose that energy because of the lack of the decrease of the pressure on the reservoir that we created, by the way, with stimulation, we are stopping there. Solution guide drives in conventional reservoir give you 20% of the EOR at the most. So in unconventionals, it has to be less. And that's the reason why we're in that single digit on average. So if you want to improve recovery in this unconventional reservoir, we can do two things. We can complete, drill and complete better, which is what we discussed before on the previous question. Or we can use EOR techniques. Basically, the idea of EOR techniques is to give you that potential to increase well recovery. It's been improving right now in payloads, basically. And basically on the academia and also on the service companies. And one of those techniques, one of them could be chemical EOR stimulation. You can do it late in life in the well or during completion. And the idea here with chemical EOR is to change or alter fluid interactions, alter variability, the things that surfactants and other chemicals do. And trying with that, penetrate deeper into the formation and mobilize those hydrocarbons. So basically with that, you are re-energizing your reservoir chemically. You're putting chemical energy. And that's the path that the chemical EOR can help. You can do it with gas EOR, in which also later in life, when you go and integrate a well like in life, you can give that extra boost that the solution that drives cannot give anymore because of the lack of pressure. So the oil that's left in that depleted formation can be produced by re-energizer with hydrocarbon gas injection or any other gas for that matter, in which you need to mix it well. And you have to actually increase that pressure to re-energize that reservoir. There are a lot of challenges in EOR techniques right now. Economics, repeatability, standardization, even understanding the first principle. This is not the same things that conventional EOR. It's quite different as everything in non-conventionals. But the challenge is for us and technologies who actually make us do this better. And we have to unlock it because the size of the price is very big. If we can unlock our recovery factors, the way that we did in heavy oil, for example, which we actually double recover factors, the way that we did in other asset classes. If we do that, the size of the price is tremendous for our industry. And also in Moortech, we have several sessions in EOR and convention from academies, service companies, and for operators as well. So stay tuned for that. All right. Thanks a lot, Johannes. So I think we don't have time for another question, unfortunately. So Johannes, Scott, Katerina, thank you so much for your insights. We would like to invite you again to attend the EOR Tech Conference in Denver next month. So to your audience, thank you for joining us today. See you next time.

Perspectives on Energy Poverty with Scott Tinker,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE live, Energy Transition through Innovation and Technology, How Europe is Leading the Path. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on May 29th, 2024. Hello everyone and welcome to this SPE live session on Energy Transition through Innovation and Technology, How Europe is Leading the Path. My name is Pierre-Emmanuel Duhard, I am the head of offshore technology development at Saipem. I'm also the director for Europe for the SPE and I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE live will last for 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. Before starting our conversation, I would like to invite you to attend the SPE Europe Energy Conference, an exhibition that will be held on June 26th, 27th and 28th. In Torino, Italy, this conference focuses on implementation of the energy transition through innovation and sustainable technology. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest for this live session. Francesca Verga. She has nearly 30 years of research and teaching experience, again at Politec Iuditorio, but also Colorado State University, the ENI Adjib division and the Ecole Nationale Supérieure du Petrol et des Moteurs, IFP school. That's actually my alma mater. Over the years, she has worked on reservoir engineering, unconventional well testing and underground fluid storage, often in collaboration with industry and governmental institutions. Currently, her research interests are energy transition, underground storage of natural gas, CO2 and NH2, and microfluidics for geoscience applications. Our second guest today is Telly Palish. She's the vice president of technology and engineering at Carbo Ceramics in Richardson, Texas, and he's the 2024 SPE president. Telly began his career with ARCO in Alaska and Algeria, joining Carbo in 2004, where he currently leads the research and development team. Telly has been an active SPE member for over 40 years, serving in various roles, including past chairman of the SPE Dallas section, past chair of the SPE annual technical conference and exhibition, famous ATCE on the technical program, and he was also the former SPE completions technical director. Francesca and Terry, welcome to this SPE live. Thank you, Pierre. Good to be here. Hello everyone. Francesca, hi Pierre. So let's jump straight away to the questions and obviously we will be expecting more from the audience today. But my question is actually for you both. Where do you see the industry's present day focus regarding the energy transition? And do you think that that focus will change over the next five years? I mean, who wants to take the first one? Ladies first, Francesca, go ahead. Oh, thank you. Okay. I think there are a few aspects which are worth recalling to understand what scenario we're looking at. The three dimensions of the energy system that make up the energy trail lemma, as it is called, are sustainability, security and affordability. And any successful and enduring energy transition transition needs to address all the three elements of this trail lemma. As far as sustainability, global energy policies and discussions in recent years, especially in Europe, have been focused on the importance of the carbonizing the energy system and the transition to net zero to mitigate global warming and climate change. So sustainability is an essential aspect of any business nowadays and all the more for energy production. And as for security, again, in Europe, there is an evident desire for countries to improve their energy security by reducing their dependency on imported energy, which is dominated by fossil fuels, and to have access to more domestically produced energy. The use of this domestically produced energy is likely to come from renewables and other non-fossil energy sources. In turn, this shift towards locally produced energy at the expense of important hydrocarbons helps to accelerate the energy transition. As for affordability, low carbon solutions needed to become cheaper to be widely adopted and to impact the energy mix significantly. And the only way that this can happen is through substantial investment. So the drivers are all there and they affect nearly every aspect of the energy value chains. So it doesn't come as a surprise that all the major companies in Europe are investing billions in developing low carbon energy solutions, which comprise renewable power, batteries, biofuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage, but also electrification and pipelines for transporting hydrogen and CO2. So I believe that in the next years, the focus might change from one technology to another as enabling solutions are found. But the path has been set and it doesn't appear that there are good reasons or convenience to for walking away from energy transition. So I don't see a change in the next five years onward. You said it well. You've covered most of the things I probably would have said, Francesca, but let me just add a few others. So first of all, I agree. The industry in recent time, but even before that, has always been leaning into the three-way challenge of providing affordable, reliable, and decarbonized energy. And the focus has been all three. And I think five years to some may seem like a long time, but five years is a really short amount of time, especially to make major changes in focus. So I think that, as you said, the focus will be remain on providing that, whether that's really, I'd say a lot of the art industry is leaning into producing hydrocarbons in the lowest environmental footprint possible. Whether that's improving recovery from existing fields or bringing affordable and reliable energy from other aspects. But it also is included, as you, I think you pointed out, decarbonizing what we're doing. So reducing methane emissions, reducing flaring, or I think our industry is now leaning into electrifying wherever we can, whether it's frac fleets, drilling rigs, things like that. Or even, say, in offshore, maybe you're using offshore renewables to power a drilling rig or a production platform, things like that. But as you also pointed out, I think that you see a lot of our industry now leaning into the things that we can really help with. Things like carbon capture and storage, geothermal. I think we'll probably talk about carbon capture and storage a lot on this call. But if we kind of just take a step in the geothermal for a moment, if you look at enhanced geothermal systems, there's been tremendous advancements from by companies like Faribault and the Department of Energy Forge Project. And they're basically taking technologies from the oil and gas industry. So the unconventional resource technology, horizontal wells, multi-stage hydraulic fracture treatments, and now we're taking the heat out of the earth in a sustainable manner. Where we really need to advance on that is getting into super hot rocks. And if we can do that, then we even, it becomes a base load energy. So, you know, I know we talked about Europepec a little bit, but there are many sessions on geothermal alone. So I don't see, again, a major change in focus. I think our industry is always going to continue to lean into that affordable, reliable and decarbonized. And I think you'll continue to see that over the course of the next probably decades. Thank you, Terry. Actually, staying with you because you brought in the technology angle. I wanted to address the engineering angle. What advancements do you anticipate in the field of geoengineering? Since now we are talking about geoengineering at large. That could further accelerate the implementation of one or more aspects of the energy transition. Yeah, Pierre, good question. You know, I guess I alluded to it a little bit earlier. You know, carbon capture and storage, you know, over the course of the last year and a half of my travels, I would say every event or conference I've attended now has sessions on carbon capture and storage, particularly in the arena of storage. If you take, for example, the upcoming conference in Torino, Europe, you know, there's there's sessions on well integrity. You know, how do we maintain well integrity and storage wells? How do we there's a panel on deployment at scale. There's an entire session on CCUS and other geomechanics. You know, we've been capturing CO2 for decades. So what's interesting is carbon capture is not all that new, although we are developing some newer technologies in that realm. And even utilizing CO2 is not all that new either. But the challenge is permanent storage. And I think that, you know, our industry and our technology, you know, the technologies that we've developed and that we the capacity we have is going to be critical to advancing carbon capture and storage. So we have a lot to learn about capacity of these reservoirs. We have, you know, we have to work on integrity. You know, how do we keep that CO2 and that carbon in place? You know, how do we monitor plume advancement? These are all things that are in our wheelhouse, whether you're a geologist or reservoir engineer or wells engineer, that technical expertise is needed. So that's CCS. I'd say the others that are I think gaining momentum would be direct or capture or DAC. You know, Oxy kind of led the lead a little bit on this, but AdNoc is now partnering with them. There's still a lot of work to do to make it economically viable, but it's going to require carbon storage as well. So CCS will be important to that. And then, you know, I was just in Brazil at the carbon capture utilization storage conference or event we did with AEPG and SEG. And one of the areas that I think are advancing quickly in Brazil and in other areas is what some people call BEC. So it's bioenergy with carbon capture storage. And, you know, that's, I think, another area that could potentially advance in the geoengineering side. So those would be probably the top three. OK, Francesca, you have a different background. You are working in the faculty in Europe. So I want to appeal to your sensitivity as an experienced professor in an international geoenergy engineering program in Europe. What competencies, so you mentioned competencies, so what competencies are and will be needed in the future to address the challenges of the energy transition? Thank you for the interesting question. You know, recent outlooks argue that the future of global energy is dominated by four trends. A declining role for hydrocarbons, rapid expansions in renewables, increasing electrification and growing use of hydrogen. And renewable energy is largely made up of wind and solar power and bioenergy, but also includes geothermal power, as Terry mentioned just a minute ago. It also appears that the energy mix will vary and the final outcome, which is expected to change over time, will be determined by two significant but opposing trends. The increase in demand in emerging economies still mainly relying on oil and natural gas as they grow and industrialize. And the shift away from hydrocarbons to lower carbon energy led by the developed world. In addition, major international organizations such as the International Energy Agency, International Panel on Climate Change, International Renewable Energy Agency, and the European Union, of course, emphasize the importance of CCUS, which Terry just recalled, for the energy transition. Just to mention, currently there are 39 operating facilities worldwide and more than 100 are under reconstruction or in an advanced development stage. So we have one certainty, which is that we need competences in a wide range of technical fields to be able to promote energy diversification and sustain the energy mix. And here I am referring to traditional hard skills such as geoscience or chemistry, material science, and of course engineering, for instance. Then of course we cannot forget the impact of digitalization, which requires a whole new set of skills, and of course the artificial intelligence, which is the elephant in the room, as they say. No one can anticipate where it will take us. However, we can predict it will likely be a game changer. So I would say that the reason necessarily a need for new fundamental competences to address the technical challenges of the energy transition. However, there will be a need to learn new ways of making use of the acquired knowledge, include economic, social, and strategic considerations when evaluating technical options, develop a flexible mindset to find the best combination of solutions, and last but not least, exploit the exceptional potential offered by ICT now and even more so in the future. Thank you, Francesca. I'm wondering if I should not take one of the questions we had from the audience, because it's talking about a few points we tackled earlier. So, the question is, what is needed to accelerate the energy transition, especially to showcase the progress to the public and gain their confidence? That's an interesting one. And actually, what triggered the idea to ask it right now is actually you have in the background, the nice picture of the Europe, behind you, Francesca, since you're also the chair of the technical program. So, I think we should take that question right now. Francesca, do you have anything to say about that? Sure. Well, that's exactly what the event that we have organized, the Europe Energy Conference is for, to showcase, to demonstrate that we're working at energy transition, that we have solutions, and that those solutions are safe and sustainable, and they can advance the energy sector. And this is both to share the solutions among researchers, professionals, and academics, but also to show the public that we can do well and that we are trustworthy and so gain social acceptance. So, one way is communicating through conferences, and everyone is encouraged to attend. Yeah, I'm going to, can I add something? You know, what's interesting to me, I've said this a couple of times elsewhere, but, you know, I think back of safety. And safety used to be a separate thing, and it's still, we do still have, you know, safety and health conferences and things like that. But really, when you know it's made the mainstream and it's in place, you see safety being discussed in, embedded in the things we do and embedded in every conference. And what I'm seeing now in a lot of our events is energy transition is now embedded. So, we're not just having a CCUS event in Brazil, but we're actually at the Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Conference, we have papers talking about how do we electrify our Frac fleet and gain expertise in that. So, you know, again, I agree totally events are one of the ways we do that. And really, what's really interesting is now they've become embedded. So, whether it's on the exhibition floor, or it's in the technical sessions, they're actually a part of everything we do. And I think that that's, that'll go a long ways. Thank you, Terry. Okay, actually, maybe I would like to stick with you with one thing. I remember Francesca mentioned a bit earlier in the session, the energy trilemna that we also found in Europe, especially in the current context, East of Europe. I mean, we all agree that we should not oppose energy transition and current oil and gas production. I'm wondering how we can integrate all the knowledge. So, my question for you, Terry, is how do you believe knowledge integration can contribute to the energy transition and help address the trilemna that Francesca mentioned earlier? Yeah, that's a great question, Pierre. I mean, let me just first, I hate to do this, but let me just draw attention to SP's mission. So our mission is to connect our members to technology to each other and external stakeholders and I think that's a page out of the playbook of our industry and of all industries over the course of the years. You know, there, if you think about what, where we've been, do you remember the term multidisciplinary teams? And we, as a society, figured out in all the industries that bringing together multidisciplinary teams allow us to integrate our knowledge and to advance much more quickly than if we work in silos. And I think that the energy industry needs to do the same thing. And when I say energy industry, I mean, there's oil and gas, I mean, there's renewables, there's hydrogen, there's, and you could dive into coal, all that stuff. We need to be thinking in terms of how do we collectively solve this trilemma because I think it takes everything. And it also depends regionally on where you're located. So, you know, if we can work together, I think we can advance much more quickly in addressing the trilemma. You know, think about this. You know, if we work together across all of our industries, we don't talk about this versus that. It's just together, it's energy. The key to this, though, is we are going to need the best and the brightest of all the industries. And so I, you know, if you're a young person on this call, you are, you're the ones who are going to solve this. And to solve this, you're going to need to have access to not just technology and understanding, but also you're going to need to work together with others inside and outside of our industry. You know, whether it's AI or it's automation or it's just more targeted to what your discipline you're working on. Thank you, Terry. I will ask some question to Francesca in a very similar one, I would say. But again, Francesca, you're teaching. So talking about skills or knowledge, which are the specific skills in the oil and gas sector that you see particularly available for the successful integration of renewable energy technologies. Okay, thank you. Well, I think that the use of subsoil is essential to implement the energy transition. And the first key aspect that comes to my mind is underground storage. It's already been mentioned in relation to carbon capture and storage, but it's not only that. If we think about renewables, rapid acceleration in the deployment of wind and solar capacity has depended on a number of enabling factors that are As we all know, wind and solar energy are intermittent by nature, so storage on a large scale is needed to balance production and demand. And so excess electricity can be used for electrolysis to generate green hydrogen, which can then be stored underground. It's not so common knowledge, but there is a long-standing experience in natural gas storage, with the first gas storage developed back in 1915 and nearly 700 facilities currently operated worldwide. The same facilities as well as the fleet at Brazevores could be converted into energy storage and thus contributing to energy transition. And then as we mentioned, the carbon capture and storage would also play a central role in enabling rapid acceleration of renewable energy technologies. And again, storage, whether in depleted fields or aquifers, is the key issue. Underground fluid storage requires much of the knowledge that is available in the oil and gas sector, such as geoscience, reservoir engineering, and a ton of other things. And then we have the And of course, not only that, but just to mention a few. And the same applies to geothermal energy, for which the knowledge common in the oil and gas industry is again essential. So I think that there's a great contribution that the traditional fields can offer to the energy transition. And as Thierry said, it's not a matter of opposing one to another, but a matter of integrating them. And in fact, this is the reason why we always speak about the energy mix. Thank you, Francesca. Okay, the title of the session is Europe, and we talked a lot about Europe, but there's an interesting question on the LinkedIn audience by Mustafa that wants to bring the African perspective in the discussion. And the question is, what about Africa, and where we have plenty of sun, but no capital and technology? So how do we move on with the energy transition? That's a notary, you have a more global perspective, maybe you can address that. Yeah, that's a great question. You know, I think that what's interesting, you know, this question could be asked all over the world, you know, different areas of the world have different advantages and disadvantages, because of what they've been blessed with, from an energy standpoint. And so, you know, each each region, each area is going to really travel along the energy transition, and that's a great question. And so, you know, we travel along the energy transition at the pace that makes sense for that that area. And the good news is that they have the ability, because of the global nature of our society. Now, I think that technology has, you know, there's the ability to bring technologies across the world. So I think that's one aspect. I think that the other you know, whether when it comes to capital, you know, that's going to just come down to when when when the investment makes sense. multinational companies that are that are investing across the world in various parts of the energy stream. And so I think, you know, someday it'll come, I don't I can't predict when. But the key aspect we have here is that, again, it energy transition is regionally focused, because of you know, what, you know, what is allowed geopolitically, but also just from a capital and everything standpoint. Thank you, Terry. I think we're coming close to the end of the session. So I would like to come back. I mean, the next time I will see you both, Francesca and Terry will actually be on the Europe. So I would like that we talk a little bit more about that. Personally, as a regional director, I was very impressed by the number of papers submitted and the very international professionals that we have here. The file of the submissions were going to have a lot of people come from all over the world in Italy. That was very interesting, because something that we would not have expected, but it seems that indeed Europe is the place where you want to showcase technology and advances in research on the energy transition. And that's a good thing for us, I would say. But could we, I mean, again, some facts about that conference that is coming on just if you can, I mean, I know we addressed it a little bit with too much question, but if you could come back on that a little bit, that would be interesting. Sure, thank you. Actually, I'm very proud of this event that is just around the corner. So I'm happy to do that. Because Europe PEC comes in a new form and also partly in a new format with respect to the past editions. Europe PEC is a traditional event that was on the SBE agenda. And this is the respond to changing world and also changing needs for the SBE society. And not only that, Europe PEC researchers, professional academics across various disciplines will have the opportunity to discuss the technical challenges to be solved, to identify the knowledge gaps, which is just as important, and then share the scientific and technical advancements in the sphere of energy transition. All this will be achieved with strategic panels, with the participation of experts and industry leaders, and with technical sessions showcasing the most recent developments. Now the key topics that will be addressed will be decarbonization, CCUS, underground storage, hydrogen and geothermal energy. All the topics that we touched on during our conference today. And the goal of the conference is particularly to stimulate technical integration that addresses the energy transition challenges in the petroleum industry, and not only. And this aims to accelerate knowledge sharing and actively contribute to paving the way to sustainable energy systems, just like Thierry has recalled. So let me say that I really look forward to meeting you all in Torino. It's going to be a great event and I'm sure it will be very, very interesting. I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it as well. Personally, I have some family in Torino, so I'm a bit biased. I'm not sure we have any more questions from the audience. I'm checking right now, but not really. So yes, I totally agree with Francesca. We are going to have also a strong program for students and young professionals. I think Torino is very renowned also for today. It's a university that is very well-known. It's a university, your university actually, Francesca. And so I think it's a very nice place also for students to come and learn. So I would invite our students in Europe and young professionals to go to the hotel. We have a specific program for them on the side and we'll be very happy to meet a lot of people in Italy. In just less than one month, actually. That time is running fast. Yeah, sure. I just say that, I mean, the lineup of speakers and panels and sessions are just incredible. The committee has done a great job of pulling together great events. I'm really looking forward to it and meeting up with our colleagues in Europe. But great event. I encourage everybody to look into that and attend if possible. I think you will not be disappointed. Absolutely. As I mentioned earlier, I was very surprised there was going to be a very international, not audience actually, a set of presenters. So it's also very rich for us in Europe to have access to this crowd of presenters from everywhere around the world. I'm really curious to know what has been done in the Middle East. Absolutely. Anyway, I was very happy to have both Dallas and Torino in the same room. I think time is running and we need to close the session. Thank you again for being there today. Of course, half an hour is not enough to discuss the energy transition, but we've got a glimpse of what's coming next. And thank you again both for your presence with us on Inkening today. Thanks, Pierre. Thank you all. Thank you, Pierre, Terry. And see you in three weeks. Sounds good. See you guys soon. Take care, everybody. Bye, everyone. Thank you."
Highlights from SPE Hydraulic Fracturing Technology Conference with Mike Rainbolt,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, hydrogen as part of the energy mix, commercial and technical perspectives. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on March 20th, 2024. And now your moderator, Zachary Evans. Welcome to this SPE Live, hydrogen as part of the energy mix, commercial and technical perspectives. My name is Zachary Evans and I'm the sales director of underground storage for Darkvision. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes and we encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guests. First, Thomas Major is a managing partner of MB Energy Partners, a private equity firm investing in companies who supply products and services to the energy transition. Thomas is also a partner with Tupper Lake Partners, a venture capital firm investing in early stage energy focused technology startups. Prior to his time at MB Energy and Tupper Lake, Thomas spent most of his career with NOV in various roles in engineering, operations and corporate development, focused on both oilfield services and renewable energy. Our second speaker is Pedram Fanalu, DNV's director for the low carbon segment for North America, where he supports customers in their decarbonization plans and de-risking investments. Pedram applies his two decades of experience in the energy industry and supports the development deployment of services covering clean hydrogen, ammonia, carbon capture and storage and low carbon fuels. As a segment director, Pedram assists DNV's customers in addressing some of the most complex issues facing the energy industry, including strategic, technological and policy decisions needed to navigate the energy transition successfully. He also coordinates DNV's go to market strategy. Thomas Pedram, welcome to SPE Live. Thank you, Zachary. Nice to be here. Well, we certainly appreciate your all's time this morning. We look forward to your expertise in this discussion. Obviously, hydrogen is a very hot topic, not just within our own kind of SPE landscape, but also the world in general. But before we get started with some specific questions, maybe we can just kind of set the stage, get both of your thoughts on where the hydrogen economy kind of sits right now, you know, what the state is concerning both where we are, where we want to be. Just your kind of opening thoughts. Maybe Thomas, we'll start with you. Yeah, sure. I mean, it's that's a pretty loaded opening question. You know, when I think about the hydrogen, at least the end markets for hydrogen, I sort of think about it in two pieces. So there's a very large existing market, which is primarily used in refining and production of ammonia. You know, that's a market that is over 100 billion in size worldwide. It's been around a long time, primarily traditional steam methane reform types of processes and really well established supply chain technology and uses for it. And really, you know, I would consider that sort of hydrogen as a chemical input, as a chemical building block. And then the second market. And so that market, I would say, is just steady as she goes. There's there's it's a mature, longstanding existing market that has a really well defined man in supply chain. The newer markets, which is what garners a lot more of the attention is, you know, things like hydrogen for use in transportation, energy storage, other industrial point sources really is a big part of the decarbonization story. And, you know, that has been a little bit more of an up and down story in terms of the journey that hydrogen has gone on. That's what I would call sort of the new hydrogen economy that a lot of people refer to. And, you know, it's much higher risk, kind of higher reward. The last couple of years have been tough. Interest rates has been tough for that as well. A lot of chicken and egg problems in terms of, you know, is the demand and uses for hydrogen there and then finding ways to produce it at low cost. So, you know, we can talk about both of those markets today. Happy to dive into either of them and the role that the oil field and the oil and gas industry could play in them. But John, turn to you. Yeah, I agree with Thomas on those points. Maybe I'll tack on a few more kind of niche areas. So, you know, we see that with the international maritime organizations decarbonization goals by the end of the year, we see that there's a lot of demand for hydrogen. By 2050, which is a phased approach to reducing emissions from shipping, that there's a lot of interest in clean methanol. You have players like Maersk who are developing like global supply chains so that, you know, their vessels have access to clean methanol around the world. Another big area of interest is North America becoming an exporter of hydrogen. And, you know, through the same kind of ammonia production pathways, using that as a carrier to get hydrogen to other parts of the world like Europe and Southeast Asia, who are already paying premiums for energy and can maybe absorb the cost of clean hydrogen. And then we also see, you know, interplay between CCUS and hydrogen and ethanol industry to be a candidate for sustainable aviation fuels in North America. So there's lots of lots of things going on. Lots of people trying to figure out how to build a business in these areas and they're coming up against some issues of uncertainties around things like IRA. Financing is also a big consideration. So a lot of activity. But again, I agree with Thomas, it's a bit of a chicken in the neck kind of scenario because you need an off-taker to be a partner for a long term to really make these deals fly. No, great, great points to kind of set the stage. As you mentioned, I appreciate the kind of bifurcating the markets into the existing role. And I think that's something that a lot of people forget about is that while hydrogen is very popular today in terms of, you know, base fuel usage as a potential future energy source, we've been using hydrogen for hundreds of years in other, you know, industrial purposes. So I appreciate you outlining that. And obviously there is a lot of uncertainty going forward in anything, let alone this hydrogen and this emerging kind of energy transition market. So as we talk a little bit more about, you know, focusing on, you know, the the dollars of this, you know, I mean, any kind of adoption large scale really leans back on, you know, cost and competitiveness of the projects themselves. So from an investor's perspective, both from your own, you know, Thomas, in your case, as an investor or as Padram as someone who helps get people ready to the investment round. What are the challenges there when it comes to current costs of hydrogen projects and maybe competitiveness against other project ROIs? Yeah. And again, you probably have to look at this in the two different market segments. You know, when you're talking about, you know, just installing another steam methane reform unit at a refinery, that's pretty straightforward. You know, that's that's investable. And as investors, we always think about things really in two major turns. It's it's the amount of risk you're taking by putting money into something and then how big the reward is. So usually lower risk is lower reward, but in higher risk, you expect a higher reward. And so the existing markets, I'd say that's sort of like your low risk, low reward type of markets, the new markets that's higher risk, higher reward. But you're also so in the existing markets, the chemical markets, they need hydrogen in the new markets. There are alternative fuels you're trying to displace. So you have a different bar that you're trying to meet your different substitutes that you're trying to compete against. Some things like transportation or even maritime applications, you're trying to compete against fossil fuel, things like diesel at the end use and the idea of being that hydrogen can be decarbonized option. But it is much, much more expensive. So, I mean, we're talking about multiples more expensive still than liquid hydrocarbons. So that as much as they're continued, in fact, based off of some of my back to the napkin calculations, a lot of applications you'd be better off from an economic standpoint, continuing to burn diesel and offset it with direct air capture as opposed to using a fully decarbonized hydrogen source after you add all the costs to decarbonizing it and then actually getting it to fueling your truck or what have you. So those markets continue to be very challenged because there's just an ecosystem that doesn't exist yet. It's going to continue, I think, to take a lot of stimulus from the government to be able to bring that ecosystem together. So that's something that I would call the higher risk, higher reward. But if you look at it just from a returns perspective, at least in recent history, share prices of the big players here have dropped by sort of, you know, probably 90, 95 percent over the last couple of years as liquidity has dried up in the market. So it's a very difficult story right now in a lot of those new hydrogen markets where the risk is quite high, but the reward is still kind of questionable whether that jogs with the risk that's being taken. But, you know, there's there's still still opportunities. I mean, you've got to find a way to get the cost of carbon capture if you're using blue hydrogen down or the cost of electrolysis and the renewable energy for using green hydrogen down significantly to be able to compete with regular fossil fuels and also the cost of transporting it, the cost of storing it, the entire supply chain. So there's a lot a lot of room for continued innovation, both in business models as well as in technology. And, Padram, do you have any other thoughts to add on on on the challenges of the cost and competitiveness? Yeah, and just just to put that into into context, you know, when we talk about hydrogen, we talk about, you know, kilograms, when we talk about natural gas, we talk about BTUs. So just to talk about competitiveness, if you converted the DOE's moonshot or hydrogen shot again to a dollar per kilogram of hydrogen, that translates to about eight dollars per million BTU in thermal units. And when natural gas is trading at less than three, you know, what we're trying to do is get people to voluntarily opt for a higher cost fuel. Now, you know, it's really costing about five or six dollars per kilogram. So the differential is is giant. And when a lot of fuels are indexed to or even electricity price indexed to price of fossil fuels, you start to see, you know, what's the problem here? You know, we're trying to get end users to find a way to to use a fuel. And there's only been one one law in energy and all of human history, which is the cheapest fuel always wins. So, you know, that means that you could see the scale of the challenge here. So, you know, people have to look very carefully about what's the value proposition, what's the need of the offtaker and the isolated areas where you could make money. I've heard investors say that actually the investments in hydrogen refueling stations in California can be profitable because of the LCFS standard there. But again, it's just Tom said, you know, without policy and government support for a lot of these projects, it's hard to make the long term economics work out. Makes makes a lot of sense in my own professional career, having worked on some hydrogen feasibility studies for underground storage. You know, we always use the rule of thumb of about three times as much hydrogen by volume to match the same BTU just in terms of a storage and transport side of things. So, you know, clearly that scaling is there. And you mentioned both of you touched on this, you know, in terms of not just challenges, but opportunities for increased innovation and development of new technologies. So maybe kind of shifting, you know, understanding the challenges currently with some potential hydrogen projects. Where do you guys see the both the need and the current trend as far as, you know, maybe technological advancements or innovations that are necessary to really get the cost competitive this down, even notwithstanding policy change? Yeah, and just going back to ammonia, I think ammonia is a very feasible pathway. I mean, there's over two dozen clean ammonia projects going on right now in North America. Silver already under construction. And Thomas said, you know, there's a really made market globally for for fertilizers that you could take advantage of and then you could leverage that in the future to use as a carrier for hydrogen to other foreign markets. Technology wise, if we think about blue pathways, you know, carbon capture and storage, industry more or less knows how to how to do that. There might be some issues and delays in permitting, you know, like classics, welds and things like that. So there's it's not. Easy, but it's doable green pathways, you know, electrolyzer technology is improving the scaling up the balance of plant kind of questions. You start seeing that actually electrolyzer manufacturers are integrating more of the power electronics and utilities into the packages to make it easier to install and get up and running, increase the efficiencies. But we're at like the 10, 20, 30, 50 megawatt kind of scale. And really what we need to get to is like gigawatt scale. So we're a little ways away from getting there. So that's where some some developments still need to happen. And that's probably why it's probably going to be the 2030s before, you know, green hydrogen takes over from blue hydrogen as those cost curves come up, come down and the scale goes up. And just for the Thomas, before we get your comments, just as a reminder to our audience, there is the rainbow of hydrogen, which we use kind of ubiquitously at this point, green hydrogen, obviously being hydrogen sourced from excess renewable energy, blue hydrogen being fossil fuel based hydrogen paired with a carbon capture. So just just for the for the audience's benefit there. But Thomas, your thoughts on technology and innovation and where where things need to head? Yeah, so I think, you know, on the on the blue hydrogen front, it really is it's a question of carbon capture, right? Not not we know how to produce that hydrogen, but it's it's the carbon comes off and there's two sources of CO2 emissions. So one is the direct CO2 emission from the from the reforming process. And then the other is from the flue gas, because it takes a lot of heat to do it to. And, you know, the reform hydrogen is a higher CO2, the CO2 coming off as higher, higher concentration CO2, it's a bit more cost effective. Flu gas is a little harder because that's more sort of a burned type of flue gas mixture with a lower CO2 concentration in it. But in any event, the current, at least in the US, the you know, you're really trying to make those numbers work with the forty five Q tax credit in eighty five dollars. You know, you've got to have a lot of things fall into place, got to be in the right geographic location, perhaps most importantly, to be able to make that work with current sort of aiming carbon capture technologies. You know, you've got to be somewhere either with really close access to a CO2 pipeline or with really close access to some sort of disposal well or both. You know, the eighty five dollars still doesn't put a ton of CCS projects into the money. So, you know, that's lower cost, like some sort of alternative to aiming, I think, is an area that has a big opportunity from a CCS standpoint, which impacts all carbon capture projects, but directly impacts blue hydrogen on the green hydrogen side. I think that Petro was hit the nail on the head. You know, it's electrolyzer technology. The challenge there is that the technologies keep getting better, efficiencies keep getting better, which is also important, not just the capital cost, but also the conversion efficiency because the conversion cost all of these processes. But, you know, I think that that's something we all know that technology is improving as can keep getting better. The thing that has to happen for big projects to start happening larger scale is that we need to start settling on a technology that's going to be able to do that. Everybody's afraid to sort of bet on a tech. It's sort of like, you know, buying an EV ten years ago, you're afraid to do it because you knew technology was changing so fast. You wanted to wait a few more years because you knew that that car was going to be way better than whatever you're buying now and probably cheaper. It's sort of the same place right now for hydrogen. So to install a green hydrogen project, the incentives have to be really, really compelling to do it now because otherwise, you know, with the interest rates are probably going to come down too. So this is another factor that is from an investment standpoint, there's a lot of reasons just to wait. And, you know, I'm not sure if just technology is going to solve that because that becomes a much more multifaceted sort of challenge in terms of how to accelerate those. You know, the 45V could help open up some of that. But even so, like renewable energy, which is what is a prerequisite for the 45V, that cost 50% more for a new project than it did at low, at near zero interest rates. So even your fuel source, the electricity sources is much more expensive. So there's a lot of reasons economically and sort of from a risk management standpoint to just wait right now on green hydrogen projects. So I would say in the interim, like continue to accelerate the iterations of innovation and electrolyzers is what's going to help us get to the promised line faster. And, yeah, go ahead, Patrick. Sorry, I was going to add to the technology issue. Maybe I'm the sole, like the CCS type issues. And something Thomas said remind me about this. So when we talk about CCS and said, you know, we've done carbon capture and enhance oil recovery before that, that's true. I think what people need to realize that impurities in CO2 streams make a big difference to integrity of those systems. So there's still material technology being developed, you know, operations that need to be devised for CO2 systems. So, you know, one reason why ammonia production and blue ammonia is taking off is that the carbon capture from that is can be effective and the CO2 stream is relatively pure. So it's easier to design a system around that. When we get to harder bait sectors like cement and other industries where there's actually a much higher chance of getting impurities in CO2 stream, that could have significant effects on the pipeline and the storage well and negative effects. So that's why these blue production pathways make sense in a few places like ammonia and ethanol production because you get a relatively pure CO2 stream. But when you start going outside of that and when people start thinking about, you know, I'll develop a point to point carbon capture hub, but then I'll invite other high CO2 emitters to tie into that. Those other two high CO2 emitters can start introducing impurities into that stream that can basically end up undermining the whole system. So that's where some of the challenge still lies technology-wise on blue production pathways. It's expanding that to encompass more industries that maybe don't have the controls on impurity management in the CO2 streams. That's a great point. I think that's often lost on a lot of folks that the efficiency, both of the process flow capture and the purity of the CO2 stream with an ethanol plant, for example, is much different than some of the other applications. And Thomas, I also appreciate your comment regarding the geography part of this. It's a supply and demand market in terms of energy and this is no different. So there's a lot of complications there. So great commentary so far. Do you want to remind our viewers that if you'd like to ask a question, please make sure to type that in the chat. And if we have time, our guests will answer that either here or after the fact. As we're getting closer to the end of the discussion, one thing I did want to circle back to, and Thomas, you had mentioned this before, is for most of our audience is in the oil and gas space traditionally. We know that there's a lot to be learned from the industrial and refining, especially along the US Gulf Coast, in terms of hydrogen. What kind of experience can we form? What kind of lessons can we learn? And where is that overlap between the traditional oil field, not just from a staffing and technology kind of, but also in terms of our investment mindset and the things that we've been successful building out in the past? So curious to hear your thoughts there about how we can overlap our current audience with this emerging energy tech. Yeah, I mean, I think that the thing that jumps off the page to me is that the oil and gas industry is really well positioned to lead the charge in CCS development and CCS projects and implementation. Most of that is going to be subsurface storage. And the oil and gas industry is the industry that understands that. And also, oil and gas is providing a lot of the funding for technologies that are going to improve the CO2 capture as well. So, you know, the oil field has been dealing with CO2 almost since its inception. So it's very familiar with how to manage it. There's room for improvement there, even though it's a well-understood way that we have to innovate to get the cost down. But when I think of what really jumps off the page, that's it. Obviously, once you produce hydrogen, the infrastructure to move it around is something that the oil and gas industry has some ability to bring to bear. But I think that's going to be sort of a bit more niche, kind of bespoke applications. I'm not sure if you're going to see a huge infrastructure blast and pipelines crisscrossing the country very soon. I think the oil and gas industry has a lot more to bring from the carbon footprint. From the carbon capture side on blue hydrogen. Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Adra, any thoughts on that topic? Yeah, I mean, let me just say a couple of things. Like, energy transition is about convergence. So it's not going to just be one industry. So, you know, oil and gas doesn't have all the answers and, you know, neither do renewables. So really, what we're seeing more and more is as an integration of these different kind of competence areas where, you know, renewable power is still important, even if you're making, you know, blue ammonia, which is, you know, one of the things ExxonMobil is getting to grips with right now with their project on the Gulf Coast. So I think, you know, one of the reasons why I have this job in DMV is because of my oil and gas background. Because understanding how we manage and move molecules and utilize them is really important. And it's very difficult to look at molecule based systems in a segmented kind of approach where each part of the value chain is siloed. You know, you need to look at the full heat and to balance for a plant to really understand does it work or does it not work, where are the bottlenecks. So, you know, oil and gas competence is still really important and will be important in the future in energy transition. So that's been what I get offered to folks and that will come to fruition in lots of ways. What I mean, customers who are looking into hydrogen or any other kind of derivative fuel, most of the time, it's people who've had some kind of oil and gas background. And investors, when they're deciding if they're going to make investment or finance any kind of M&A activity, they want to know that there's the right people who experience in those technologies to actually make the project work. So it's not going to go away. It just needs to be adapted. And we just need to realize that the energy transition is going to be about integrating this with other developments in, whether it's renewables or other spaces. And kind of dovetailing into that kind of perfectly, we do have a question from over on the SBE Energy Stream. And that question is, what are we doing to attract college students and young professionals to hydrogen operations? And it kind of goes hand in hand with what you're saying, Padram, about utilizing that same skill set, maybe just in a different capacity. So any of your thoughts on, you know, the kind of the opportunities for younger professionals in this emerging market? I mean, if you're willing to adapt your, excuse me, your knowledge to the energy transition, I mean, I think it's still a great industry to be part of. I mean, the oil and gas industry has had its downturn, you know, the Shell Revolution, and then, you know, COVID came along. But, you know, we're trying to accomplish something in one generation, which is to create a decarbonized energy system that took us five generations to get here. So we're going to need a lot of smart people who are going to be dedicated towards this. And just like Tom said, you know, innovate. The energy industry has always found a way to innovate itself out of a corner, you know, through generations of regulations that come into place. This one's harder because we're trying to do it in one generation. But I think all the young people that we can get can contribute to it. Yeah, I don't have a whole lot to add to that. You know, the question is, I guess, what are we doing to attract my simple answers? I'm not really sure. But when I think about young people who might have some interest in the space, you know, there's a lot of different skill sets that have to come together. But at the core of it, it's really sort of like a chemical and process engineering problem. And, you know, I don't know if it's necessarily a hydrogen specific skill you need to have, because this is going to be just a piece of a much larger puzzle that's going to be part of the energy mix moving forward. So I think that having it in your tool belt to be able to understand what's going on in hydrogen operations is very valuable. But, you know, hydrogen is an incredibly flexible and valuable chemical feedstock. And it has some interesting potential applications in energy and uses as well. But it comes down to understanding chemical processes. And so, you know, I would say that that's sort of the skill that needs to be recruited to be able to continue to move a lot of these projects forward, certainly from an execution standpoint. That makes a lot of sense. And gentlemen, I appreciate both of your comments so far. I think this has been a very enlightening discussion on a topic that is, you know, very much on the forefront of a lot of people's minds. As we close out here, any final comments for our audience, you know, regarding hydrogen as a general concept? Thomas, maybe we'll start with you. These open-ended questions, they're difficult. Well, yeah, I mean, I think that I don't have a whole lot of additional comments other than, you know, there's a lot of work to be done here. So, you know, find a, I mean, it doesn't have to be all hydrogen, right? If it's an area of interest, find a corner of the hydrogen landscape and build expertise in that and see what you can do to contribute. I don't think that there's no silver bullet here. So, what we need is going to be experts in sub-segments of this. So, that would probably be my closing comment. Yeah, and I like Gorko Thomas here because he tees up some of my catchphrases I like, which is, I agree, there's no silver bullets, but we need to think about silver buckshot. And that's all the energy transition is going to take. There's no there's no panacea kind of solution. We do need to think about things more flexibly and we've got to start somewhere. So, I hope we're at the, you know, the bottom beginning end of an S curve as we start to see, you know, some things like the hydrogen hubs start to be implemented and we start getting value chains put together and the supply chain put together that that will start to snowball and by the time we get to the end of this decade, hopefully we'll have this same kind of conversation with a lot of investments in Thomas's portfolio and a lot of completed projects in Dean V's portfolio. But I think the future is bright. I know we have challenges with regulations and understanding incentives, but those will be resolved. And I think the deeper we go into the transition, the public will come to realize that they will support this more and see the benefits of it. You know, once it starts moving into communities and creating jobs. So, I'm an optimist. That's how I think of the future and yeah, let's see what happens. Yeah, as you said, it's an exciting time, a lot of opportunities, a lot of challenges as you both laid out, you know, but that challenge is just allow a lot of opportunities for innovation and new engagement. And as Thomas mentioned, a lot of work to be done. And then we certainly appreciate y'all's role in that. And we certainly welcome those watching today to get involved if this is an area that they are particularly passionate about. Gentlemen, thanks both of you for your time this morning. Apologies for the open ended questions, but I really appreciate the discussion, very practical information and I'm sure our audience appreciates it too.

Getting Back to Fundamentals with Shauna Noonan,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live Separation Design vs Reality. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on June 17th, 2024. Hello, hello. Welcome to this SPE Live session, Separation Design vs Reality. My name is Henrik Wietveen and I'm a director of process technology at Cranzi Solutions. I will be the moderator today. Today's SPE Live will take 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the event. It is now my pleasure to introduce you our guests, which are Graham Smith. He's a process engineer for Murphy Oil, responsible for process engineering and production chemistry for Murphy's offshore assets. He has worked in various roles in the upstream offshore oil and gas industry, including in process design in the North Sea, equipment package supply in the Middle East, troubleshooting and the bottlenecking globally, and in operations for Murphy. Graham holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Monash University in Australia and is a chartered engineer for the ICME. He's also on the technical committee for the SPE Separations Technology Group and on the Produced Water Society's annual conference technical committee. Logan Grimm, our second guest, is a senior process engineer at Aramco based in Dharam, Saudi Arabia. In his role, he's responsible for the process aspects of capital projects, operational troubleshooting and consultation for oil and gas facilities across Saudi Arabia. Logan graduated with a master of engineering from Imperial College London in 2008. He started his career with the engineering contract, the Foster Wheeler, now Wood, where he worked on process design and construction of refining petrochemical LNG and upstream facilities before moving into process systems engineer. Logan is a chartered member of the ICME and was chairman of the Separations Technology Technical Section from 2020 to 2023. Graham and Logan, welcome to this SPE life. Thanks for having us. Thank you. Yes. So today we will be talking about differences in performance of separators and then particularly differences during design phase compared to the operation later on. So design versus reality. I think we, many of us know that there are very often differences. So it's interesting to check out why we so often we we see these differences. So, Graham, let me start with you. What do you consider to be three important factors for causing these differences between field operation performance versus separated performance during the design phase? Thanks, Henry. I'd say for me the top three. I mean, when you're doing the design, you're assuming the vessels clean and the internals are all clean and going to function as intended. The reality is that once you get into operation, you start bringing on new wells and and have process fluids in there. You're going to end up with some sort of deposition of failing, which which will impede the performance of the internals, whether that's a coalescing plate or a baffle plate or a demisting device. This could be sand or asphalt team or scale, etc. Then the other one is unstable or very varying inlet flow rates and slugging. And that doesn't necessarily just just mean the inlet separator or slug catcher also means downstream vessels because those instabilities can translate right through the process and end up with with flow rates that are sort of outside the design envelope as well. And then the last one is temperature. We we specify temperature in the design cases, but often that doesn't reflect the reality as we go through the the life of facility. OK, OK. So that's that, for example, means a change in viscosity or other changes as well? Displacity change in NGO are you might be below the wax appearance temperature in the fluids so that that can exacerbate deposition and things like that. OK, OK. Logan, can you add some to that? I guess you don't have the three same. Graham must be looking at my cheat sheet because they're the same ones that I was thinking about too. But I think the the two others that I might add to that is that a lot of the times we design these things from a few exploratory wells and we don't actually know the physical properties of all of the producing wells at the time of design. And so you end up with with differences in physical properties and particularly emulsion properties, like the chemistry of the emulsions, then what you were expecting when you did the original design. And the other thing is like typically these the design methodologies that we have are all based on the movement of droplets in ideal fields. And I think there's a big disconnect, especially when it comes to oil water separation, that that's not necessarily the motion of the droplets is not necessarily what limits the what limits your design. And when you are assuming that a 200 micron or 350 micron droplet is going to achieve your separation performance, that doesn't always bear out in reality. Could it be? Can I ask one? Could it also be that it is also does also play a role that, let's say the the actual performance prediction methods are a bit lacking that, you know, very often people just have a particular performance that they desire or an industry specification. They just specified and and a contractor or a vendor might not even do a very predictive calculation to actually come up with a performance, but he just follows criteria and then comes up with a particular design. Could that be one of the causes of differences as well between reality and design phase? For sure. I mean, I think that's particularly, you know, I think that particularly around things like missed eliminators. That is that is very true. I think, you know, there's going to be a shop talk later on, I think, in a few weeks about this very subject. But the actual performance of missed eliminators in in my experience where we've measured it has never been less than 10 times the typical industry spec. But it's also understanding how that fits in the overall process to if you don't need that on an inlet separator, if you've got trim scrubbers and stuff like that, too. So make sure we're actually specifying the right design criteria to start with. Yeah, so that sort of ties into a second question that I also had. How does design performance requirements typically compare to actual? And is that always a problem? Do we always need the same type of performance? What are common requirements and are they realistic? Logan, what do you think? I think, like Graham said already, I think the the specs that we give are often completely unachievable, but also unnecessary. You know, it's the reality is in a production field sort of environment, you don't need point one US gallons per million scuffs. And similarly for oil water separation, you know, you basically have to get your water cut down low enough that your electrostatic vessels can handle the the water cut going into them. So it's not necessary to actually achieve very high degrees of water removal in upstream equipment. But actually, the reality is you get quite a lot of variability in what you actually can achieve in a conventional gravity separator with or without coalescing internals. The other aspect to that is often the electrostatic coalesce is actually work better when you've got a little bit more water in them, too. One percent BSMW out of your three phase separator, you may actually be sort of reducing that performance and the electrostatics. But the other other specification that I do see that is maybe not stringent enough or is on the oil and water side. We often specify 2000 ppm out of the three phase separator separator into the produce water system. And typically, if we've just got hydrocyclones and a float cell, it's going to be very difficult to meet your overboard specification with 2000 ppm coming into that. OK, produced water equipment, something somewhere around the five hundred is probably going to be more achievable consistently to make sure that you're meeting your specification. OK, so that's to the water side. So on that side, you're saying actually that sometimes the specifications not even stringent enough that we should be targeting a lower oil and water out of the three phase into the produced water system. But for many of the other phases, for example, the gas liquid separation or the oil quality, I think it's very often the opposite. Right. Isn't it? Yeah. That we're expecting point one US gallon. But in reality, I think 10 US gallon or one US gallon or whatever it is, dependent on the application is is probably what you're going to get. Yeah. And no one else. No one actually bothers because everything usually does function. Some exceptions left to decide. Yeah, making sure you don't have slugs of liquid in your gas rather than having very fine mist. OK, so talking about slugging, is that one of the typical performance issues that you see at the inlets? You know, how do these flow rates or changing flow rates and flow regime affect design? And is that considered during design phase? Graham? Yeah, yes. Yes, slugging for sure is at least an inlet separators. It's it's a major factor in in sizing, sizing the separators offshore. I'm sure Logan can get into more details, but I'm going to go downstream a little bit because remember that the slugging, if it's not well controlled and inlet separator, you're going to end up with slugging all the way through the process. And one of the biggest issues I've seen with slugging recently is actually going into an electrostatic coalescer because of the the piping hydraulics were not great. And you ended up with preferential flow of water versus oil in between the trains and then big gas pockets forming as well and then slugging into the into the electrostatic coalesces. So it's not just something you need to consider at the front of the front of the plant, but all the way through and address it with you with the controls and adequate separator sizing. So it is not really it's really not caught by the slug catcher or the first aid separator. They are not really able to to fade out those those slugs. OK, have you seen something similar, Logan? Yeah, so one of the things I would say is at least for this is onshore facilities, slugging is the rule for us, not the exception. Almost every facility that I'm aware of that we have has slug flow on the inlet. And this has all sorts of, as Graham said, knock on effects going downstream, but also within that within that first inlet facility on the very first separator in your process, those flow fluctuations cause oscillations on the interfaces, which means you can get very high levels of oil and water going down to your produced water treatment. You know, there are facilities where I've seen of the order of 10,000 ppm going into the downstream facility, which is very challenging for any downstream facility to to handle. And, you know, having an effective means of dampening it if possible, but also considering that when you're looking at your interface levels, how close to those interface levels can you be to avoid getting any kind of oscillatory entrainment of oil down into your water produced water system? And that's generally not even considered as part of the design. One thing to consider is making sure your level control spans cover enough of the vessel as well. So, yeah, so effectively allowing slug volume. If you expect slugs, which you say in your facilities, you're always it's the rule instead of the exception that you have those. Yeah. Yeah. So one more thing is not only process, but also mechanical. Is that something to consider for the internals when you're expecting slugs? Absolutely. Yeah. I've seen inlet devices sitting on the bottom of vessels because they got hit by a massive slug and the mechanical design didn't didn't account for that too. So, yeah, you have to look at a range of velocities that you might see over the life of the facility. Velocities and slug size and composition. I have a collection of photos of inlet devices on the on the bottoms of vessels. Yeah, it's very common. And even in even in some vessels, they've redesigned the inlet device to handle the slugs and it still wasn't enough. And there's a year later, we went back in and that same device was on the floor. Yeah. Yeah. I got one question from a friend of mine. Yeah. Yeah. I got one question coming from what does it say here? Energy stream from at grave who's asking how can we obtain better data from our exploratory wells to better predict oil water separation and degree of emulsion? What would you say about that, Logan? That is a very hard question. I think that's more of something that you have to end up doing when the facility is sort of online and producing. You need to be continually monitoring the individual feeds from the individual wells, seeing how each of those is behaving to build up a kind of profile of your system. I find it. We don't generally drill enough exploratory wells to really have a full characterization of the field. So I don't think we're ever going to get to a point where we can do can do that in the initial design phase. I think it's something that we have to monitor over the life on the way. Yeah, you've got to get on top of that early. It's making sure your design cases are broad enough to start with. But then, I mean, when you're producing wells with multiple zones and varying GORs and things like that, it comes down to more communication between the process team and the reservoir team to get that data early and then start looking at modifications. When when they're in the in the well, so you can get that done in time for first or just early communication. Yeah, as much as you can, of course. I've got another continuous communication, not just continuous. Yeah, continuous. Well, it's yeah, it's always well when you bring new wells and stuff online. Yes, then things will change and yeah, you you try to manage as good as you can. I got another question from the energy stream from Bart Prast. And he's asking, I've never encountered health monitoring on internals. Is that available? People might be running for years without missing with missing or damaged internals. Yeah, yeah, there's a few things you can do. And basic troubleshooting is seeing what the temperature looks like across the vessel. And if you see any anomalies, I mean, that might give you an indication of whether you've got got sand at the bottom or some plug coalesces. There's more detailed diagnostics you can do with with vessel scans, companies like Tracerco and that they can they can scan the vessel wall and tell you where your interface layer is in your phone layer and that sort of thing. And traces as well. And you can use that to build up a really good picture of where your fluids are going for each phase. You might see your gas going below your phone breaker and the you know that your phone breakers plugged or you might see male distribution across the vessel that might indicate your inlets inlet devices is not functioning or not in place. Yeah, same. I think you can probably also see in the device failure like that, right? If you do the right scan on you, you will also be able to see that. Maybe also online if you measure pressure drops or if you have other online measurements, maybe well, not always present, but sometimes the downstream vessel major changes there or operational issues, of course, but that's not really health monitoring. I agree to that. We got another. Yeah, go ahead. That good pressure drop monitoring across the vessel would probably would probably be able to tell you if your device or your demister was failing. But my experience in this is that people don't either don't have that or don't monitor it or don't maintain and calibrate it. So I'm not really I don't think that would be a something that's feasible. The only time I've ever detected an internal that's actually, you know, fallen down is the internal itself scratches the coating of the vessel and then you get galvanic corrosion and the sacrificial anode gets high current telling you something's going wrong in that vessel because you're getting high current on those. But that's that's really the only thing online that I've ever seen tell you it's broken. OK, I've got one more question from Jimmy Reasonberg. He's also sending a question on Energy Stream. He's asking generally what percentage change in fluid properties who were just talking about fluid properties and additional wells and will result in poor performance. Is it mostly density or viscosity and viscosity or maybe also something else? What do you think Graham? That's a fairly open question, really, because it depends on where you're operating relative to your design rates as well. I mean, if you're later in and field life, your temperature might have dropped and your viscosity might be a lot higher, but you might end up with a lot more residence time. And so you can handle it. But conversely, I mean, it may not be a density and viscosity thing. It might be that your your motion tendency has changed because you're operating at a lower temperature. And so that has a bigger impact on the performance of the vessel. OK, so I don't know that I can give a percent like that. There's so many there's so many variables in a separator. Yeah, yeah. OK, I've got one or two more questions in the in the stream, but I also want to continue with another question on the internals. Internals often have obviously are essential to meet the performance requirements. We haven't really talked much about the internals yet. So what differences have you experienced between internals design and how that affects versus operations? How do internals perform as they expect it or not? Logan, we talked a little bit about it, maybe about the vein. Yeah, you mentioned. Yeah. And I would say that the sort of two things that we've kind of touched on already is the performance that we see in the field is generally quite a lot worse than might have been predicted by by sort of the conventional methodologies that we see. I think generally speaking, you get worse performance than than is expected by the design methods. And yeah, it's it's. Yeah, there's one of these things. Could that also be could it also because of poor internal selection during design phase? I think it's to an extent, yes. I think often people put in internals that are prone to fouling in ways that are not that might work well. And for the first few weeks of production, but after they've been in there for six months a year, they don't they don't work as well. And sometimes I would say that having a robust internal that's actually functioning as intended is way better than having a advanced sophisticated internal that doesn't that doesn't really stand the test of time. And one thing that comes to mind for me is like corrugated plates in vessels versus conventional plate packs for production systems. I'm not a fan of corrugated plates. I've never seen one come out of a vessel that isn't fouled. Exactly. And you know, I would much rather have a big open plate pack than a corrugated plate. And as soon as that starts to file, then it actually becomes worse instead of better. If the corrugated plates already did a very good job to start with. But that's that's another question. OK, so I got another question from Ed Grave again. He asks how reliable we were just talking about these analysis or about these methods to to analyze the or to have a look at the vessel as online. And he's asking how reliable are guided radar level detectors in production separator? Well, actually, it's a little bit different guided radar level detectors in production separators. Grave? We're in the program of changing out basically 40 brand new ones that didn't work. So it is going to vary from vendor to vendor. But the recent experience has not been particularly good with them, particularly where you've got things, asphaltenes and waxes and that that fail them up. OK, so I think the right the right application, they're OK. OK, where where there's a lot of fouling, maybe not. Maybe not. OK. And they're not very good at detecting emulsions. You know, they get calibrated for one permittivity. And then, you know, that that may or may not be representative of the interface and or the the various levels within the vessel. I'm a big fan of the nucleonic types. If you if you can have those, they're they're much better. They give you a much better indication of what's going on because you get you don't just get one point. You get you get a band of properties. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. Another question comes from that. I hope I'm afraid I'm saying it right. Tanguy Mufua Nukwama, that's a bit hard for me on LinkedIn. Which parameters do you consider in the separator design when the well is 100 percent B&W producer? And how do you manage temperature when the well is producing very hot oil coming from the well? Logan, I'm not sure what he means by 100 percent B&W producer because you wouldn't generally produce a well that's now only producing water. Oh, 100 percent emulsion. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, maybe 100 percent emulsion. That would make more sense. You know, really getting your your chemistry right, getting your your demulsifier selection and kind of being adaptable, not just not just expecting that it's a one and done, that you're going to have to keep you're going to have to keep monitoring it, keep changing the rates, the compositions, the types of demulsifiers you're using. I don't have any particularly hot wells in my experience. I'm not sure what challenges producing a very hot oil would would bring to it from a initial design point of view other than the mechanical considerations. I mean, on the emulsion side, it sounds like a demulsifier applied at the well might be something we need to look at rather than just relying on one of the separator. So, yeah, obviously a pipeline is your best separator to start with. So, at that point, you need to separate it through gravity separators are not really designed to separate emulsion like that, designed to separate two phases and just split them. So if you've got a motion, a stable motion coming into the separator, I mean, that's going to be a difficult one. Yeah, you need to get separation happening further upstream. Yeah, you can't separate emulsion. You need to fix it upstream. That's the only way. Okay. A question from Molly George, Energy Stream. How critical is the design and type of instrumentation to control the system in the separator? Very important. Very important. Like I mentioned earlier, I mean, at least make the level span cover the whole range of the vessel and the internal so that you know that your liquid level is keeping your cyclonic inlet sort of level above the bottom of the cyclonic and that you've got enough space between your demister and that too. So, yeah, it's crucial. Okay. Another one coming from Moist Turkey from Energy Stream as well as industry. How close are we in terms of estimating droplet size distribution as that can play a significant role in the internal evaluation and performance? So how close are we estimating droplet sizes? Logan. I would say we're for certain systems we are okay, but I'd say we're pretty far away from a general prediction of droplet size distribution and entrain fractions for gas liquid and we're nowhere near for liquid liquid systems, you know, oil and water droplets and water and oil droplets. I would say we have very little, if any, really reliable ways of predicting those in production systems. Yeah. Also, I mean, what what range over the life is it going to be valid for as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I agree with that. On the on the gas liquid side, I think we there is quite some information available, although you can't see it obviously, but a lot of information has been tested and liquid liquid. It's too hard, too hard. Well, I think that brings us to the end of almost to the end of this SP live session. Is there anything, Graham, that you want to add any final thoughts on on internals design or performance prediction? I say keep it simple. No, understand what your company's maintenance philosophy is in terms of vessel cleaning and vessel entry. Are you going in every year or every five years because that influence what you what you want to put in there? Yeah. Logan, anything to add? I would say keep things robust and reliable. Try to, you know, try to cover as wide a range as you can and not to not to get down to a very fine minutiae. These things are not precise animals. They're there. There's a lot of variability in what we do, and you need to you need to be accounting for that when you're designing this. So robust design is good. Yes, both mechanically and process wise. Exactly process and mechanical. Mechanical. OK. Well, that finishes our session today. I'd like to thank everyone for joining and we hope to see you on the next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

The Influential Yet Delicate Balance of Mentoring with Shauna Noonan,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Leadership Development Impacts Career Transition and Progression. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on October 11th, 2023. And now your moderator, Patricia Carreras. Hello everyone. Welcome to this SPE Live session, Leadership Development Impacts Career Transition and Progression. My name is Patricia Carreras and I am the general director of the consulting company Blue Moon Strategies. I am also the SPE diversity and inclusion chair for 2022-2023. For organization purposes, this SPE Live will last 30 minutes and we encourage you to please ask questions during this program. And now it is my pleasure to introduce our speakers. Sri Vikas is the manager of market intelligence and business analyst at ConocoPhillips, where he leads a diverse team responsible for developing corporate perspectives on E&P markets. Pricing and costing of all field goods and services, supply chain analytics, and OFS, all field services sector developments. In addition, Vikas previously served as the president of the United States Association for Energy Economics and as the chair of the external advisory board at Penn State University, where he has prohibited the development of an online education portfolio that integrated multiple energy related programs, benefiting industry professionals considering career transitions to economics, management, data analytics, and system optimization fields. Vikas is set to assume the position of vice chair, chair elect, for the management technical section of SPE during the 2023-2024 term. Now it is my pleasure to introduce the other speaker, Jeannie Perdue, who is a technical writer at Occidental Petroleum, where she teaches a technical writing class. After earning a bachelor's in chemistry at the State University of New York at Albany, she worked in the Texaco Research Labs as a chemist for nine years and as a librarian for four years. She then became senior technology editor for Hart's E&P Magazine and later launched the over winning Upstream Technology Magazine. As a distinguished member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, Jeannie currently serves on the SPE Business and Leadership Committee and SPE Distinguished Lecture Committee. Jeannie also serves on the University of Houston Petroleum Engineering Advisory Board and on the board of the Houston Community College Foundation. She and Jeannie, welcome to this SPE life. So happy to have you here. Absolutely. So good to see you, Patricia, Jeannie. Good to be here. Thank you. So let's start with this program. And I will ask to ask she, we are going to talk about leadership, right? Leadership training, the importance of leadership training. Then what is leadership in your own words? All right. Let me start, Patricia. For me, leadership is a set of behaviors. It's not a position in my view, and it's the ability to be part of the change. It's about serving as a catalyst to implement change by creating and communicating a vision. All right. And a few more things that I would like to talk about. All right. And a few more things that I think about when leadership comes to mind. Leadership is not always about being in charge of others. Rather, it's about three things. Leading yourself, leading self. Second, leading others. And third, leading the business. You are frozen. All right. Leading self means three things. Taking accountability, driving performance, and making decisions. Leading others means communicating effectively, empowering others, partner collaboratively, and building teams and talent. Leading others also means that individuals should have the ability to manage anxiety of others around you. And finally, leading the business means three things. First, think strategically, demonstrating financial and emotional acumen, and leading change. I have a strong conviction that leaders don't create followers. They create more leadership, more leaders. And you will find component of these leadership competencies in a newly launched leadership training program that you will hear later about. So overall, it's a very important piece. It's really important for everybody in our E&P industry to be a leader. Either leading yourself, leading others, or leading business. That's what I have to say, Patricia. Thank you so much for those inspiring words. I really like one word, collaboration, right? We always need collaboration to get things done. Shini, what are your thoughts about leadership? Well, first, I agree with Sri that leadership is not a position of authority, right? It's rather it's having influence over other people or groups of people, right? It's the human to human contact that makes people want to follow you, to walk in your footsteps, to see you as a role model, right? I recommend this book, Everyday People, Extraordinary Leadership, and it's by James Cousas and Barry Posner. It's a good book for those who, even if you're an individual contributor, you can still have a lot of leadership characteristics, right? And so according to them, leadership is a trusted relationship. A trusted relationship. Leaders model the way, inspire a shared vision, challenge the process, enable people, and encourage people. These are very people centric skills, right? And such courses are not really offered in petroleum engineering curricula in the universities, right? So SBE's leadership training courses are going to be a great way for members to learn and practice and acquire these skills. Thank you so much, Shini. I really like that you recommended to read a book, right? It's the only way, reading books, attending training, in which we can learn, at least that's my personal opinion. Now let's talk about an important skill from leaders, one that we are exercising at this moment. Communication skills. What are they important for career progression, Shini? Well, if leadership is a relationship thing, everybody knows better communication yields better relationships, right? And so these communication skills are vital. Your boss doesn't read your mind. He doesn't know what you're doing all the time. So you have to tell him or her what you've accomplished on a regular basis, whether that's stopping by the office for a chat, writing a weekly report of your progress, doing a PowerPoint presentation, or at the end of the year, documenting how you achieved and exceeded the goals that you set for yourself at the beginning of the year. So again, you've got speaking and writing and documenting and presentation skills. These are not usually a part of the undergraduate curriculum at our universities if you're in a petroleum engineering program. But the more you practice these skills, the better you're going to get, of course. And so one of the first things that I tell attendees of my oil patch writing class is the top 20 percent in writing ability, the top quintile, if you will, make three times the salary of the bottom quintile, the bottom 20 percent in writing ability. Kachin. Thank you, Chini. Shree, your own thoughts about communication. So in a long time back at my company, I worked for ConocoPhillips. One of the pretty senior person came to me and asked me, tell me, Shree, as a leader, what do leaders do? And I was just going around the bushes and was talking about, you know, they set visions, they do this, they encourage people, they collaborate. What he said, as a leader, you communicate. That's the only thing that you do. You communicate your vision. You communicate to be part of the process. You communicate what is going right. You communicate how people can be brought together. It's all about communication, right? Good communication skills will enable you to convey your values, work well with others, and also adapt changes, adapt to changes, demand and changing priorities of the oil and gas industry, which all of us are faced. So good communication skill is going to be very, very critical. If leaders do not communicate their priorities clearly, then people around them will not have much idea what their own priorities should be. And if that happens, time, energy and the capital gets wasted. And you don't want to do that. So it serves as a positive force that inspires and empowers others to achieve collective kind of a success. And you will find that in the SP leadership training program that's being launched in ATCE, communicate as a leader is going to be a very, very important module. How do we communicate? So that's what I have to say from my standpoint, what communication is and why it's important for career progression. Excellent. Thank you. Please remember that, right? Communication is not only about talking, but it's also about how you communicate with presentations, PowerPoint, et cetera. You really need to become an expert, I would say, because it is very easy to be an expert on PowerPoint presentations. But many people do not have that skill. Now let's talk more about numbers and finance and economics. So I would like to ask Sri at this opportunity, what do you think is the impact for a leader to know about finance and economics for EMP projects, exploration and production projects, for example? Yeah, that's very I mean, this is this is a topic that is very close to my heart. Okay. Understanding finance and economics is absolutely important if you want to rise up in your career, progress in your career, and also able to understand daughter and sense. Right. It will help you understand or bridge the gap that I have mostly seen in technical professionals who are unable to kind of explain a compelling reason for change. Why what we what we do matter? Why now? What is the bottom line impact, et cetera? So you need to really understand the concepts. The financial leadership or financial concept training that you will have in the SP technical course, SP leadership program, that help you understand the financial and quantitative indicators, market environment, et cetera, and how that impact your business. You know, if you understand finance and economics, you will be able to analyze stakeholder needs, global, political and market trends to understand how they shape the future and impact your business results. You will be able to prepare realistic budget estimates, not cost staff, et cetera. Right. So staffing costs and other needed resources are needed. And you will you'll be able to understand the financial reports, analyze what it means, identify and evaluate strategic priorities for your business, for your team, et cetera. And finally, you will be able to deliver compelling messages to internal as well as external stakeholders about financial performance, future expectation and the rationale for change. Again, this again comes back to communication skills important, but equally important is finance and economics skills because they go hand in hand together in order to be really impactful in your your value delivery, et cetera. So that's what I have to say about the importance of finance and economics on EMP projects, Patricia. Thank you so much. Jeannie, your turn. Well, you can have the best technical idea in the world, but if it's too expensive and it won't pay for itself in the long run, management's never going to approve you doing it. Right. And so it's not only managers that have to have this financial acumen, even even engineers and geoscientists. They have to understand that profits and shareholder returns. This is why we're in business. And the university curricula generally focus on the scientific and technology aspects of of what we're doing in our industry. And so SVE needs to fill in those blanks to offer trans to offer training on the financial and economic aspects from the macro global scale of of the economy down to the micro scale of optimizing each engineering solution so as to be profitable. Sometimes you just have to sacrifice the better technology for the good enough technology, simply because it makes economic sense to do so. And having these financial skills will really help SVE members climb the corporate ladder. Thank you, Jeannie. Thank you so much. Now let's talk about sustainability. But before doing that, I would like to encourage the audience to please submit your questions through the chat. The speakers will be glad to answer your questions. And this provides an active participation in what is being said. So Jeannie, sustainability. You know, we have heard a lot about sustainability during the last years. We consider it is extremely important. So can you share with us why leaders need to be knowledgeable about sustainability? Well, Patricia, if we want our oil and gas industry to be sustainable, and truly that is coming to question as of late, we need to take the bull by the horns and make it sustainable through technology, which is what engineers are really good at in the first place. Right. But we have to start by knowing what the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs, are. And we have to work diligently to achieve them in every single aspect of our business. Here are some examples. We got the goal number eight. Decent work and economic growth. Company leaders have to ensure high levels of local content in their contracts when they're planning projects in developing countries, when they're training local community members and giving them high paying jobs, they're purchasing materials and supplies from local suppliers, local firms to grow the economy there. And then we've got the goal number two, zero hunger. The natural gas our industry produces is made into fertilizer to grow bigger and better crops to feed people all around the world. Then we've got the goal number 14, life below water. We've got a rigs to reefs program that was featured by one of our distinguished lectures. And this tackles decommissioning in a very cost effective way by using the substructure of offshore platforms to support aquatic life and fisheries. And of course, there's goal number seven, affordable and clean energy. Right. Our energy is all about using technology and innovation to make our operations safer, cleaner, better, cheaper, more efficient with less environmental impact. And so, for example, we're reducing or eliminating flaring to reduce methane emissions. And we're using direct air capture for sequestering CO2, pulling it out of the air and injecting it in under the ground to reduce our carbon footprint. And this has the potential to for net zero oil. What a concept. Right. And so this is these steps are going to ensure that society has the energy resources it needs while meeting the Paris agreement goals. Thank you so much, Amy. Thank you for mentioning that. And I would say that knowing about the sustainable development goals from the United Nations is absolutely mandatory these days. I even would say, please know about them by memory and not obviously only the names, but what they mean. Right. They are concepts. Extremely important. Sri, your comments about sustainability. Yeah, very good. You know, Jeannie, you eloquently covered the topic. I'll just add my few words on that is whatever word sustainability comes to mind, I think about sustainable energy. Okay. And I don't think about energy trilemma. I think about hierarchy of needs. You need to first have energy available. Then it has to be affordable. Then it has to be sustainable. Right. We have eight billion people in the world. We can't just think about one billion people. There are seven billion people who are energy poor. How do we make sure we are sustainably creating energy for everybody? Right. So and then we all realize energy industry and especially oil and gas industry is changing. And SP professionals need to be part of this change. So being well informed about all the things what Jeannie talked about, sustainability is not only the right thing to do, but also a strategic necessity in today's rapidly changing energy and business landscape. So that's what I have to say on sustainability. Thank you so much, Sri. I will continue with you. And now I am curious to know about collaboration because a leader does not act alone. What are the current trends on a stakeholder engagement for sustainable subsurface engineering? And if you can provide some examples so to enlighten our audience about this, that would be great. Perfect. So a leader does not act alone. That's absolutely correct. We talked about it, you know, throughout the last 20 minutes or so. Right. So in my view, stakeholder engagement in sustainable subsurface engineering is a critical component. Of responsible resource development and environmental protection. So stakeholders can be anybody. Stakeholder can be your own peer. Stakeholder can be external people. Stakeholder can be your management. Stakeholders could be your local school and others. Right. So it's absolutely critical to engage, to talk about where you are coming from and what are you doing, how you are playing your part in sustainable subsurface engineering. Okay. So that's important. You will find in the leadership development training, the two separate modules on stakeholder management and how we can do that. There are two-hour introductory course. There's a deep dive, et cetera. That's very, very important. And SP is taking it very, very seriously. How do we make sure the stakeholder engagement is done in the right way? And everybody understands where the oil and gas industry is coming from and what role we can play in sustainable subsurface engineering. So that's important. Personally, for me, there have been several examples in which people didn't quite understand how the oil and gas industry can play part of the sustainable subsurface engineering. People who did not know the industry. And for me, personally, I feel you need to know energy to change it. Right. So I explained about energy industry, why it's needed, where it's going, what part oil and gas plays in there, and we need to be sustainable and we need to play our part. So that's what I have to say. In my view, finally, I have to say effective stakeholder engagement helps in our license to operate anywhere. Thank you. Jeannie, a stakeholder engagement. Well, historically, the oil and gas industry has always held its information very close to the vest. They didn't want people drilling nearby and wildcatters kept all the information on the down low. But that may have served our industry well in the past, but today it's just not going to cut it. The culture of not sharing information with the public, it just doesn't work anymore. So if we want to maintain our license to operate like she said, we want to continue to have lease sales on public lands. If we want to be able to get banks to finance our investors to finance future oil and gas projects, we're going to have to open up. We're going to have to communicate clearly and simply so that the public understands exactly what we're doing and how we're doing it. We got to communicate compellingly with regulators, legislators and the public so they know what we're trying to do. We're trying to do it safely. We consider ourselves to be environmentalists. After all, we love this planet, too. But the typical engineering skills that we've had in the past, they're going to continue to be used for sustainable energy for carbon capture and sequestration, for geothermal, for hydrogen. For offshore wind even. And so we're going to continue to have petroleum engineering and need their skills. The trouble is they don't communicate very often with the public unless they have downstream gas stations. There's not a lot of contact with the public to let them know. But in order to teach the public, first we have to teach ourselves the technology with SBE's help, of course. And then we need to boost our communication skills, our collaboration skills, our financial acumen, our leadership competencies and our sustainability expertise in order to engage all these various stakeholders and bring them all to the table. And then if we have the investors, the regulators, the lawmakers, the public, if everybody's at the table with us, we can collaborate with them so that we're all on the same page when it comes to providing the energy that the world needs while protecting our precious planet Earth. And so SBE has an important role in doing this, in providing these leadership skills for this important work. And that's why we're launching the SBE Leadership Development Training Program. And this is going to prepare SBE members for success in the future during this energy transition. Thank you, Ginny. Thank you for your support to the petroleum engineering career. Careers evolve as the world evolves. And we know that we are going to play and we are playing an important role in what is happening in the world regarding sustainability, climate change. So to wrap up this conversation, as the training program was mentioned in more than one occasion, I would like to ask Sri if he can please share the components of the program with us. Absolutely, Pratisha. I would love to do that. If you can go to the slide. Absolutely perfect. So SBE has risen to the occasion and we have worked, this has been really splendid work for last, I think about two years, for many leaders who have worked on SBE Leadership Development Program. And what you're seeing on the screen is a high level component, a high level description of the components that are part of that SBE Leadership Development Program. We talked about it in the first bullet on the left side. We talked about all of those during our 25 minutes, right? Talking about communicating well with peers, supervisors and teams, understanding financial aspects of a project, knowledge of local sustainability and energy transitions are absolutely important for leadership, right? And then there are four components to that on the right side. Communicate as a leader. That will be about 20 hours of modules, online modules, financial fundamentals, about 15 hours, sustainability leadership, about 15 hours. And then there's a deep dive in which SBE members can deep dive into various soft skill training. They can have deep dive on communication skills, they can deep dive on financial skills, they can deep dive on sustainability leadership. A plug that I would put together is the SBE event, ATCE event, which is happening next week. There is a session in the SBE Pavilion in which we'll discuss more about this program. So please come over, join us and we can talk more about it and answer any of your questions you have. Thank you, Sri. Yes, I can only emphasize about if you are interested on improving your leadership skills and you are going to the ATCE, please plan to attend this session. That will be held on October 17 between 2 and 2.20 p.m. OK, so I have some questions from the audience that I would like to address to Shini. What are your ideas on how we can support SBE members for scaling their professional skills like communication and business acumen? Well, I highly recommend our new training development course that we're fixing the lunch. That of course is a good way. And it would also be good to have SBE members serve on industry advisory boards for universities to make sure that these kinds of important skills are being addressed in their curricula. For instance, I serve on the University of Houston Petroleum Engineering Department Advisory Board. And I tried to make sure that we have, you know, team building and some of these soft skills are worked into the curriculum because, you know, at the end of the day, petroleum engineers are people and they have to have people skills when they work in our industry. And the better their soft skills are, the better their financial acumen is, the better their communication skills are, the faster they're going to rise up the corporate ladder, the more successful they're going to be and the more successful their companies are going to be. OK, so you think Shini that SBE members can influence the universities to incorporate these items on the curriculum? That's right. That's right. You have to make sure that the curricula are up to date on sustainability issues, number one, and you also have to make sure that the soft skills are being practiced in their classrooms using team based projects, for example, and do those kinds of things that they're developing these skills along with their curriculum. And also, you know, with their technical knowledge. Thank you so much. Any other comments, Shri, we are closing in a minute. I think Jeannie summed it up absolutely perfectly. We need those projects, we need to have communication skills built right from the start so that when they come to the business, they work in the industry, they can bring those skills to play. It would be incredible if you can do that. So nothing else to add. This is just perfect the way she summed it up. Thank you so much. Then I would like to thank both speakers, Jeannie and Shri, for being here. What a productive half an hour. And also our audience for attending and for your questions. With this, we are wrapping up this session. Thank you so much to everyone. See you next time. Bye bye. You can find the full story of the show at streaming.spe.org.

Strengthening the Feedstock of Incoming Oil and Gas Talent with Shauna Noonan,"You're listening to the SPE podcast. I'm Adam Wilson and we're talking about data and AI in the petroleum industry with Jeff Bates from IBM. Welcome Jeff. Thanks for talking with us today. Well, thank you for having me, Adam. Jeff is a 26-year veteran of the software consulting and industrial and manufacturing markets. And currently Jeff is the global industry chief technology officer with IBM. So today we're going to talk about data in the oil and gas industry. And as you know, the industry is famous or perhaps infamous for having vast quantities of data. And this staggering amount creates the challenge of how to find the most relevant data to answer a specific question. So where does artificial intelligence and machine learning fit in with this? Adam, I've been doing a lot of research on this for this specific podcast. And according to a markets and markets report, the artificial intelligence and machine learning market for the oil and gas business alone is predicted to be worth north of $3 billion in the next three years. And this pertains specifically to the predicted spend and investment made by companies in this vertical market. So this is not a new thing. The petroleum industry, as we all can imagine and have seen over the last nine months, has been in such a major state of disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. And mistakes just cannot happen that will only put more pressure on an industry already under an immense amount of financial pressure. So focusing on digital transformation in artificial intelligence has got to be a top priority for oil and gas companies that want to reduce risk, but while improving operational efficiencies in the process of making conservative capital decisions. Some other research that I found out was the average offshore oil and gas producer experiences, and I found this to be very surprising, but 27 days of unplanned downtime per year costing millions of dollars and unforeseen cost to the bottom line. And these decisions, if they're not made correctly, can affect one's job or even the entire survival of the company. So volumes of data, accounts, real-time updates, geoscience, geophysical reports, petroleum engineer insights and other sources all exist. And unless a petroleum company has a true and what we call a cognitive computing approach, you know, much of this data is sitting in unstructured data silos, making it difficult to research, compile and develop and recognize trends to make confident decisions. Artificial intelligence helps with this data consolidation need and approach. Yeah, you mentioned the unstructured data silos and all the different types of data that's there, and a lot of the data that the oil and gas industry has available is this unstructured data. So how can artificial intelligence be used to help access that data and make it useful? So Adam, let's talk about that question about unstructured data and how artificial intelligence can help clean and sort, simplify, standardize and really sustain operations. So there are new technologies like visual, audio, touch, speech and reasoning machine learning that's being supervised and unsupervised learning can help collect and interpret, coordinate and analyze and display unstructured data more effectively. And we believe that we need to promote the use of this data from design, drilling production, HSSE, which is health, safety, security and environment and decommissioning. HSSE obviously pertains to a business making the safety sustainability in the environment the number one priority for the company. But big data is everywhere. There's historical operational data, there's data in silos like we've talked about earlier, there's internet of things or IoT real-time sensor data at the well or at the field level. All that can be part of a company's digital transformation, digital maturity path and more importantly beating your competition. All right. Enabling a cognitive mature approach allows AI, robotics, blockchain, IoT analytics and digital twin technology data to be incorporated into one consolidated and mineable, mineable repository to make better and correct business decisions. Other areas like past failures data, past successes data, gathering data from different sources and domains, they're all part of this nirvana-based cognitive solution that never stops learning. It learns and enables petroleum companies to make what we call one and done confident capital decisions. So how do you get started? So first, we believe an investment must be made in the infrastructure of the discussed cognitive approach. It must be business driven with, and this is very key, you have to have executive sponsorship. Right. On-premise hybrid cloud or 100% outsourced cloud solutions exist from the top technology partners and are readily available. Second, understand that artificial intelligence is a journey, it's not a destination and that planning at every stage is very critical. And third, interview, assess and pick a solid and proven business partner. I like what you said about executive sponsorship. I mean, so much of this stuff needs to come from the top and work its way down to get these solutions in place. The industry has so much data because it's been collecting and storing it pretty much since the beginning. First, this data was saved on paper, logs and what have you, and then on tape, and now it's all saved in the cloud. But that adds to the struggle of accessing it and making it useful. And so how can artificial intelligence be used to bring that legacy data into the modern age? Yeah, Adam, historically, oil and gas companies have older legacy systems that manage their businesses and they're still operating in silos. And an agile approach is recommended to be able to pivot and pivot faster with readiness from a business change and technology change perspective. So cognitive solutions allow companies to truly find the path in their data. So there's software that exists that now picks up and learns things like corporate jargon, understands questions and requests, deals with natural human language and slang. You can believe it slang without any coding. So processes can be learned and with cognitive software solutions, it continues to learn and never stops learning, uncovering optimization opportunities, paths within your data and defining options and ways forward that are confident and correct for drillers. Answers can provide immediate impact as the value prop and businesses that keep pace and operationalize their data are going to win regardless of the market or industry vertical that they're playing in. History has always played an important role in operations research and AI. In partnership with our clients, we're looking for both patterns and anti-patterns or what we call a hypothesis. Additionally, a null hypothesis that can raise our performance in effectiveness and efficiencies is also a top priority. And the law of large numbers allows us to see the range, control points, common causes and special causes. So our clients, again, like we talked about earlier, can act or pivot faster with higher results and less resources. To move the curve, you need to know where you are and where you're going. And data is so similar to the petroleum inventory analogy. We move inventory in different containers depending on the required usage needs. Data will always be transforming where it becomes information to knowledge to action. We've discovered that action is not always electronically delivered, however. And in certain issues, we may revert to paper, tape or a manual device like you talked about earlier for certain requirements like access to electricity, to power a device or an externality where we required backup instructions on paper. Although artificial intelligence can clearly help transform data from paper and tape to audio, video, sensor, actuator or reasoning scenarios with speed and efficiency, the end user determines quality of the user interface. And there's a funny quote that we've been tossing around internally. Just because we can doesn't mean we should. This is where AI can help with the reasoning part as well. Yeah, making reference to Jurassic Park. So caught up in whether or not they could. Didn't stop to think of whether or not they should. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SPE programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other SPE members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location or experience level. To learn more about the League of Volunteers, visit spe.org. So all of this data and all this legacy data, right, it's, you know, one of the main problems is all the different formats that it's in. You know, you've got this unstructured data that could be in emails, it could be in spreadsheets, it could be PDFs or there's so many different formats. There's an endless variety of formats for this, for data that can be useful. So what kind of standards can we look for or what kind of standards can be applied to this oil and gas data to make it universally valuable? Yeah, this is, I think, one of the more important parts of this podcast, Adam, is, you know, really in this area, we need to constantly drive home the importance of standards. The balance of standards versus innovations or change has got to be constantly monitored. I mean, we're looking at IBM in terms of our analytics business, it's changing every 90 to 120 days. The technology is changing, the requirements are changing, the scope of what certain products do or need to do is changing. So the benefits of standardization fundamentally means that your employees will have an established time-tested process to use. And I've got to think that in oil and gas, there are many, many standard and very important processes. When done well, standardization can decrease ambiguity, decrease guesswork, guarantee quality, boost productivity, and in the end, improve employee morale. So the what standards need to be asked after the why and how mentioned earlier. The how is in the domains, domains one and two of what we call the job task analysis or CRISP method that you can leverage to your advantage. Then the what standards should then be driven by when and to what context or scenario. So the standardization of formats depends on the actions taken prior in domains one and two as a reference. You can use other methods like DMAIC to help define those standards, but it's always preceded by sorting, simplifying, cleaning, and then standardizing where the standards is, then unsustainable because a process or technology advance has made the standard obsolete. For example, look what happened when I was in high school 25, almost 30 years ago. Look at the standards in video from VHS and beta. So the ability to recognize change is as important than the actual standard. The answer to these questions relies on the scenario and needs of the user defining quality that the standards must align themselves to. Business insights is where the cognitive and machine learning tools come into play, driving business efficiencies, business performance, and in the end, what are we all after? Positive financial results aiding your employees, stockholders, and consumers. Machine learning allows computers to learn and interpret the data without having humans in the way involved to interpret that same data. And here's the fact of the matter, Adam. Human operators make mistakes. With machine learning and artificial intelligence software, solutions allow petroleum companies to respond faster to concerns not detected by those same humans in the process. So new connections and new insights are quickly returned to the business as a result of turned to the business leveraging these technologies. Machine learning and AI allow computers to assess large volumes of disparate data, those data sets that we talked about in the many silos, and make appropriate decisions to solve complex problems like how the human brain functions and solves problems. AI and ML programs are designed to never tire, continuously evolve, and get better. They will improve and new information and data as it's ingested. As a result, AI and ML solutions allow for more effective forecasting, for example, again without any coding or dependence on IT people or data scientist resources that are near and dear to our heart that are usually busy and overburdened on other critical projects. Leveraging AI and oil and gas company can enhance their business operations, employee and resource productivity, and their safety efforts. Additionally, applicable data standards can be, for example, adoption of AI related chatbot technologies. CDC's got one about COVID-19. They're all over the place. A lot of retailers are using these chatbot technologies. Big data standards allowing companies to better understand gathered intelligence and meaning out of the data they're managing. Another example. Third example is exploration robot technology. Some of these that are now new, in some cases autonomous, or planning to be autonomous in reference to ongoing testing. There's lots of different examples where this is being done today and effectively so. Yeah, and it sounds like something you said earlier applies here as well. You have to know where you are and where you're going to do this effectively. But where we are right now is standing in a sea of data. You've heard this before, I know. Data being called the new oil. Because I guess because there's a lot of money in it. But oil by itself, well, it's not as useful as it could be. And so just like oil's got to be refined before you can use it, before you can put it in your car and drive around, or the myriad things you can do with it, so much data. You have to refine the data as well. So what sort of things is IBM doing to sort of refine data from the oil and gas industry to make it more valuable? So Adam, in one way, shape, or form, IBM's partnered with just about every enterprise oil and gas client. And we're of course 109 years old global company in nature from an innovation and support perspective. And with the global chemical and petroleum industry facing some pretty unprecedented challenges today that are ever changing, and volatile crude pricing, changing socioeconomic and political environments, and new forms of competition, there's all these different factors of disruption. And IBM's helping our clients in this vertical to position themselves to overcome this challenging, new, ever-changing current business climate. But also to grow revenue, improve employee productivity, take cost out of inefficient business practices, and capture efficiency, allowing our customers to join the ranks of what we call the outperformers. So with reduced demand and increased demand, we're naturally just rethinking their current strategies and cost cutting. With all of this understood, IBM is helping our clients in the areas of redesigning of business strategy and design related services. So that's number one. Number two, we're trying to help our clients digitally reinvent themselves and achieve the projects that we're trying to achieve. And then finally, we're trying to help them develop and achieve the promises of what industry 4.0 solutions can offer a business. Third, artificial intelligence for the optimization of connected drilling and drilling determination. Previous podcast I did for SP was about where to drill, how to use AI to make sure you're drilling in the right spot. Number four is improved customer experiences at the pump. And there's some other ones that we researched as well. Oil field production optimization, leveraging AI data and analytics, closing the skills gap, supply chain optimization and realization. And finally, things like quantum computing, overall business transformation for the better versus your competition. Or it's around AI decision-making assistance regarding mergers and acquisitions. We're starting to see a lot of consolidation in the industry today. So we're refining and cleaning data. More important, all you like data is to inventory models, are to machines. So there's analogies, but the data is the data that needs to be clean, sorted, simplified, standardized and sustained to the requirements into the context of the specific client. So that's how we're doing it today with our clients. Yep. That's what people mean when they talk about the industry's digital transformation. It feels like there's a lot more to talk about. It feels like this is where the frontier is. So much of what the industry does, it's been doing for a very long time and has gotten very good at it. And so the advancements are incremental. What did you say the turnaround time was or how quickly things become obsolete? It seems like in our industry, especially in analytics, that things are changing every 90 to 120 days and you just have to buckle up and get ready because it's just life. I mean, things are innovating very, very quickly. It feels like this particular aspect of the industry is advancing quicker than some of the other more traditional sides of the industry. Do you have anything else you'd like to add about? You know, I do. I do. And I know that you wanted to talk a little bit about how IBM has been involved in the oil and gas industry's digital transformation. And if you look at IBM's history, even from the early days, IBM has been involved in the development of solutions from hardware, software, services to even financial services that we offer our clients. And the breadth and depth of IBM's 109 to I think now it's 110 year history has not been limited by industry geography or what we call domain. It's really to benefit our customers based on the technology that we bring to bear. But it's more importantly, the people at IBM who are the knowledges, where it's been developed, deployed and refined. And we are obviously seeing the world changing hourly, daily. IBM's been in the enterprise space for many years and does have the history. So the question that we all ask ourselves is can IBM continue to build on that history with the right products, places, people, price and promotion to grow the market and the IBM Corporation in general? And I think we all would agree that the answer continues to be yes. Special thanks to you, Jeff. Thank you so much for coming and talking with us. Adam, it's been an absolute pleasure to be on this podcast with you and I hope we can do more of these in the future. Thank you so much, Jeff. Thank you. Thank you for your time.

Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE LIVE! Geothermal Vision for the Oil and Gas Industry and Why It Is Critical. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on August 28th, 2023. And now your moderator, Camilo Mejia. Welcome everybody to another SPE LIVE! Geothermal Vision for the Oil and Gas Industry and Why It Is Critical. My name is Camilo Mejia, Geothermal, SPE Technical Section. I'm really excited today. We are going to talk for 30 minutes about geothermal in the oil and gas industry. We encourage everybody to pose the questions. And I'm really excited to introduce our guest today. Dr. Brand Jones is the Executive Director of Geothermal Pricing, a non-profit educational association and research organization. Dr. Jones has 20 years of experience working on public policy at the federal state and local levels. His career went all the way to Capitol Hill, the White House, the U.S. Department of State. His academic research explores social policy, organizational structure, and the collective action of reasons to enable technology adoption and how we can reduce the barriers or eliminate the barriers for technologies to flourish. Dr. Brian Jones, welcome to the SPE LIVE! today. How are you? Hey, Camilo, it's great to be with you. Really good. Thank you for joining the SPE LIVE! today. Brian, let's talk about geothermal rising. What is geothermal rising? What is important? What is the kind of takeaway for the audience today? Yeah. Well, it's great to be here, first of all, with you, Camilo, and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. So geothermal rising, we have a mission to build and empower the geothermal community. Part of our role is to support and facilitate academic and industry research as it relates to geothermal energy. And we also promote geothermal technologies and applications to the public, to policymakers, investors, educators, the media, and other external audiences. So that's the those are the three major focus items and focus topics for geothermal rising. Thank you, Brian. We encourage everybody to post questions in the chat. Geothermal is hot. There is a lot of things going on in the geothermal space. I'm sure everybody has a lot of questions. Brian, what are kind of the vision for the oil and gas industry? What are kind of the critical projects that will enable geothermal to the next phase, which is, I guess, what everybody is really pushing for? How we achieve geothermal scale? What is geothermal rising doing? Yeah, well, right now, the oil and gas industry plays a critical role in promoting and advancing the geothermal industry. There are a lot of technologies. There's an existing skill set and workforce from the oil and gas industry that is using technologies that we want to need. We want a need to transfer into the geothermal industry right now. And so we geothermal rising is working with the Society of Petroleum Engineers, with Project Interspace, with other organizations to help facilitate that transfer, both of technology, but also of skills, knowledge, workforce to help promote and advance geothermal. Thank you, Brian. We see a lot of activities in the geothermal, especially in the US lately, significant advancements when it comes down to really new ways to develop geothermal resources as scale. And I guess the question, Brian, is why geothermal is critical? What's kind of the messaging for everybody listening today, and especially the oil and gas industry? Why do you think geothermal is critical? Yeah, well, first of all, geothermal is a it's a renewable clean energy technology. We need more of it. We need more. We need to help address the climate change. We need to help address the changes that we need in our energy economy and our energy systems. Geothermal is a major player and a major part of that conversation, and we haven't had enough of it in the past. Geothermal hasn't been a part of the conversation in the past. So in geothermal has a long history. It's a lot. There's a long culture of the geothermal industry. It dates back all the way to 1892 in Boise, Idaho, where the first direct use geothermal system was created. And we've been producing electricity since the 1910s in Italy and the 1960s in California. Electricity from geothermal resources, that is. So there's a long history of geothermal in the United States. And we need to leverage the knowledge and the skill set of the oil and gas industry, which has been able to really expand the ability to drill, the ability to understand the subsurface. And that knowledge is one thing that geothermal rising, along with a lot of our partners, are trying to transfer into the geothermal industry right now. Thank you, Brian. You mentioned something really interesting, which is about really pushing geothermal in the agenda for many things to happen. And geothermal rising went to a capital kill, I believe, a few weeks ago. Any takeaways from that meeting? Any kind of insights for the audience today? Yeah, well, one thing is one of the fascinating things about geothermal is that it is able to once people learn about it, they become obsessed with it. And we just need more people to know that geothermal is a solution that's mature, that's proven, that it's a now technology, it's ready to be deployed, not just in the areas where we traditionally think about it out in the Western United States or in more active volcanic areas like Iceland and Indonesia. But there are a lot of, but because of advancements with companies in the geothermal space, companies like Fervo Energy, Ever Technologies, there is a huge push to bring geothermal everywhere. It is an everywhere technology. And these new companies, they're not new, but these innovative companies are really breaking the boundaries that we've traditionally thought of that have held geothermal back. And so Fervo Energy recently announced major accomplishments, major achievements for some of their drilling technologies. Ever Technologies last week was in Germany launching one of their closed-loop geothermal system, which will bring electricity onto the grid in Germany next year. We have other companies like GA Drilling and Quazed Energy, which are really pushing the boundaries and bringing in new technologies for the drilling side of geothermal. And there's a lot of investment pouring into these companies from the oil and gas industry, from environmental NGOs, climate NGOs, and philanthropic organizations that are really interested in how we're going to genuinely draw down the climate crisis. And geothermal needs to be part of that equation. It is a solution if we're going to take climate change seriously. Ryan, I think that's a really kind of critical messaging. And that's something we do at the SBE as well, trying to demonstrate that geothermal is not really kind of a dream. It's actually a reality today with very competitive costs. And I think that's something we share with geothermal pricing at the SBE as well. So maybe the question is, how do you see the collaboration with the SBE? What do you think is critical that we work together? And what's that kind of outlook for the industry in general? Yeah, well, maybe some of your viewers might be aware that Geothermal Rising partnered with the Society of Petroleum Engineers, with Project Innerspace, and we all applied as a consortium for a large Department of Energy grant. It's called GEOD. And that grant, the Geothermal Energy from Oil and Gas Demonstration Engineering, is what GEOD stands for. That grant is going to help transfer and help facilitate the transfer of knowledge of workforce of technology from oil and gas into geothermal. So we, Geothermal Rising is just, this is just the beginning of a deeper relationship with SBE. And one that we're really excited about. We also have more events that we're going to be planning one-on-one. We have a symposium later this year in Colorado. It's Geothermal Rising and SBE are putting on mutually together. And I will have more of those in the coming years as we continue to deepen this relationship. Thank you, Brian. Since you mentioned, obviously, the big collaboration with Project Innerspace, with Geothermal Rising and SBE, any insights from that particular project that we can share with the audience? What's kind of the major highlight? Major highlights are that by the end, within 12 months, once we're still in negotiations with DOE, but 12 months after those negotiations conclude, we will have a solicitations, competitive solicitations that we will release as a consortium for oil and gas companies, for geothermal companies to apply for and to try to identify those proven, ready-to-go technologies that the oil and gas industry is already using on a daily basis, but we're not yet using in the geothermal industry. And so we need to, the purpose of that grant is to help bring those technologies, those now technologies into the geothermal space. So there'll be some grant opportunities coming down the road, about $155 million in total that people can be on the lookout for. Thank you, Brian. And I think, you know, to start thinking about people, the skills, the knowledge transfer, which is obviously one of the major synergies between the oil and gas industry and geothermal, what is that messaging for drone professionals, Dr. Jones, that if you have the opportunity to tell people in oil and gas, geothermal, about the future of geothermal, what will you tell them? Well, I would tell them geothermal, it's a now technology. The people in the geothermal industry realize that, and they know that they offer a tremendous, important, critical solution for drawing down the climate crisis. But one of the challenges for the geothermal industry is that the policy has just not caught up yet. Policymakers need to consider the unique characteristics of geothermal when they're drafting legislation. And that is just beginning to change. We're starting to see momentum at states, at the federal level. And that's exciting and that energy is picking up. We also need to realize that geothermal is a solution to other technologies that have recently received a lot of funding. Direct air capture, hydrogen, those two industries will not be successful without geothermal. They need geothermal electricity for the power needs that those technologies require. And geothermal provides all of what those technologies need in order to scale. And I think that's a great comment, Brian, because most of the time we relate geothermal with power generation. But there is direct heat applications. There is a lot of things with minerals production. There is even hydrogen opportunities that goes directly into geothermal. But let's talk about direct heat for a minute, because that's a really big, big space within the geothermal. Any insights from geothermal pricing around direct heat application, smart cities that we appreciate? Yeah, it's actually the area that is probably just starting to get talked about right now. It's been underappreciated for so long. But it's that what we call direct use applications of geothermal technologies. And then there's thermal energy networks where we can connect municipalities to geothermal resources that provide heating, but not just heating, but cooling as well. And that's critical. Unfortunately, geothermal is inaptly named, but it also provides critical cooling benefits to communities. You can air condition your house with a geothermal ground source heat pump. You can also heat your house. And those heat pumps are 40% more efficient than air source heat pumps, 70% more efficient than your traditional furnace, which helps when we're talking about electrifying so much of what we use from stoves to air conditioners. That's going to put an incredible strain on the existing grid. We're already having a lot of challenges building more transmission lines. Well, geothermal offers that solution to bring to bring heating and cooling so that we can we can decarbonize the built environment and not have the need for additional transmission line or as much need for all this additional transmission lines that we need. You can also bring geothermal closer to load centers. And that also helps reduce that transmission need. But heat pumps, direct use, industrial applications, there's from chemical manufacturing to heavy industrial manufacturing, and geothermal offers a solution for to remove an entire operating line item from the budget because you don't need the constant source of fuel with a geothermal resource. And so there's a lot of companies, especially in Texas and Louisiana, chemical companies that are looking at geothermal assets and geothermal resources for their for future heat needs. Thank you, Brian. I think that's a really good question. So in terms of economics, how do you see the progress for both power generation, direct heat, the evolution of the liberalized cover of energy in the power generation, the cause of heat? How do you expect or what's your projection over time for the next five, ten years in order to increase adoption? And how is that optimization? Yeah. Well, one thing when it comes to LCOE, we really need public utilities to start thinking about the value of an electron. Geothermal offers a very high value source of power, and that value is not yet fully appreciated by our in our levelized cost of electricity calculations. And a good example of that is that is is a nine megawatt geothermal power plants on average can generate electricity for about five thousand five hundred homes, whereas that same the same nine megawatt solar power plant can only generate electricity for eighteen hundred homes. So you're going to need three times as much solar to provide the same amount of of power that you would from a geothermal power plant. So that's a lot more of an that's a that translates into a lower impact on the environment, less mining for critical minerals. Also, one thing we haven't really touched on, but a reduced risk of geopolitical conflict. A lot of our critical minerals come from countries where that are have are have some recent conflict with with the West. And so geothermal offers a domestic source of resource, a domestic resource that is really critical for geopolitical stability. Thank you, Brian. I think let me just ask the audience to keep posting questions. We are getting to the end. We don't want to let Brian goes without a pretty good set of questions. So, Brian, the last questions to start kind of looking into the questions from the audience. What is that really relevance today from geothermal? If you can just put that in one sentence, what will you say the relevance of geothermal is for the industry? For the oil and gas industry or for in general? In general, the relevance of geothermal is that if we are genuinely going to draw down the climate crisis, geothermal needs to be a bigger part of the energy equation in the in the United States and in frankly, in all countries around the globe. Geothermal is an everywhere technology view. You do not need to be near volcanic activity to access the benefits of geothermal. We can decarbonize the built environment through geothermal technologies, industrial heating, the power sector. And we just need to be geothermal needs to be part of the conversation more often, more frequently. And that is something that geothermal rising is striving to do along with many of our other partners. And we're we're seeing those that change. I mean, the New York Times came out with an article today about what the great work that Fervo Energy is doing and Forge, the Forge project in Utah and is and the innovative the innovations coming out of the geothermal space, Sage Geosystems looking at this storage capabilities of geothermal. For as another example, there's so much innovation coming out of of the geothermal space right now. And it is really exciting to see it. And we're starting to see private investment. The governments take more notice, but we it's not enough yet. We still don't have enough policy support, enough private investment coming into the industry. And so that's what I hope we'll see is continued growth in investments into the geothermal industry. Thank you, Brian. Let's just look at some questions from the audience today. I think I'm going to pick the first one. Any comments from your side or from geothermal rising in general about the combination between low-tem power generation and combinations with the A-Kit. How is that integration in that particular niche market for you guys? Yeah, it's one thing that's really bringing the entire geothermal industry together and to be one family. There has been a traditional historically, there's been this sort of some division between different types of technologies of geothermal over the past. That's ending and we're seeing a coalescing and of the geothermal industry coming together, realizing that it's all one family to the external to the external audiences. They see us as one technology, which we are and we're seeing that more and more where where power companies like Ever or Baseload Capital, Baseload Power, these companies are realizing that they can produce power and also send the direct use geothermal, the heating applications to a nearby chemical manufacturing plant, for example, or to a nearby school or a hospital so that they can use the heating and cooling benefits of geothermal for that facility, whether it's a school or a hospital, and then they can also be producing geothermal. So that co-location or that co-use of the same geothermal resource is going to only grow. And that's really exciting. Thermal energy networks is another really hot topic right now, especially in the northeastern part of the United States, where there are some moratoriums on natural gas in places like Massachusetts and New York. You have that existing natural gas infrastructure. Thermal energy networks offer a solution for those natural gas utilities to transition to become a geothermal utility, utilizing some of that same existing infrastructure. Some of it would have to be replaced, but some of it can also be used with it through a geothermal system, through a thermal energy network. So waste recovery heat is another one. You see this in big cities where all that steam that's coming off of buildings, that is wasted heat. You can capture that heat and you can, from maybe a post office, for example, that is producing a lot of heat, and you can move that over to an apartment building and the apartment building can then use that heat in the winter. So that's another use of, it's not technically geothermal, but it's still thermal and it's still part of the geothermal family. Thank you, Brian. The next question is something that I believe there is a lot of potential. And what's kind of the take on asset repurposing, converting latest stage oil and gas assets into geothermal producers? That's probably one of the interesting areas in today's kind of landscape. So what's your take on that one, Brian? Yeah, it's really, it is fascinating. And there are companies like Transitional Energy out of Colorado that is looking at repurposing oil and gas wells. There's a lot of potential. We know there's a lot of data in those oil and gas wells as to what the bottom hole temperatures are. And companies can repurpose for both direct use and or for power, either gas oil and gas wells that are no longer producing or that are producing, but can still but are producing enough heat that they can bring that heat to a nearby municipality, a school, a hospital, as I mentioned earlier, or even produce electricity for a local town nearby. And so that repurposing oil and gas wells is a big opportunity, a gigantic opportunity for the geothermal industry. There are millions of oil and gas wells, and many of which are, not many, but some of which are abandoned and orphaned. Those ones in particular, which are now a liability for governments, could be repurposed into oil into a geothermal producing well, which would help alleviate the liability issue around them. Coal is another one, like coal power plants that are going offline in places like Page, Arizona or Valme, Nevada, Coal Strip, Montana. Those are creating challenges for those local communities. Well, geothermal offers a solution. You have the surface infrastructure there, the connection to the grid, the turbine, the ORC turbines or other turbine equipment. And bringing geothermal to those facilities could help those communities weather the transition into the clean energy economy. Thank you, Brian. And our question is related with the long term view between oil and gas geothermal. We know that oil and gas is going to last for many more years. There is a significant kind of need of reliance or reliability from fossil fuels, which is obviously what we have been doing over the past, I don't know, entire history of humanity or modern humanity. So the question is how we balance sustainability for geothermal and oil and gas in the long term? Yeah, well, we will always need oil and gas. It's just we need medical device equipment. We need plastics. There's always going to be a need for oil and gas. And what we can do, what geothermal offers is an ability to offset some of that need, some of that demand with a renewable, clean, base load, stable energy source. And the workforce and the skills and the technologies, like drilling technologies, subsurface characterization, management, and those are the same between the two industries. That can be utilized both by the geothermal industry and by the oil and gas industry. So the synergies between the two are really deep and will continue indefinitely because they are both subsurface technologies. So that's one thing that's really exciting about geothermal is that it uses so much of the existing skills and knowledge of the oil and gas industry. Thank you, Brian. I think that's the right message. And it's not one or another. It's actually both going forward. Follow up questions is around obviously the cost effectiveness of geothermal energy today. Will you say that geothermal is cost effective today, Brian? It is the upfront capital cost for geothermal is more expensive than other technologies right now. That is because we don't have the right policies in place. We don't have an industry agnostic energy policy in the United States yet. That is something we need to try to address. There are risk mitigation programs, cost sharing programs for helping to do for drilling exploratory wells or monitoring wells for geothermal. Those types of programs have existed in the past. We need to either bring that, you know, turn them back on or create new programs that can help reduce that upfront cost. That's the major hurdle for geothermal. What's holding geothermal back is not engineering or subsurface, a misunderstanding of the subsurface. It's not a technology challenge. It's a policy challenge. It's a social challenge. We need to change some policies, create some new policies that will help empower and embolden the geothermal industry. And then we can utilize that existing, as I mentioned, the existing technology and workforce of the oil and gas industry to really scale and commercialize so many different types of geothermal technologies from closed loop to EGS to traditional lithium recovery, traditional and conventional geothermal and more. Perfect. There's actually a follow up question on policies, which is obviously for you, Brian, you really manage very well. So the question is, where is the main state policy that is really needed in order to increase geothermal adoption or geothermal developments? I would say that the main one is reducing that upfront capital cost through those risk mitigation mitigation programs or cost sharing programs. That's that's one of the main ones. Of course, a categorical exclusion for permitting on federal lands would be helpful. More deployment dollars so that we can we can help municipalities transition from from a natural gas network to a thermal energy network. That would be helpful so that those deployment dollars companies are engineered geothermal system companies, EGS companies and closed loop companies are going to need more dollars for demonstrating their technologies, but also deploying those technologies, because many of them are now proven as and the research is there both not just in the lab, but also in the field. And so there's going to be we need more deployment dollars as well. So we need the Department of Energy when they're when and Congress and the state and state legislators to be thinking about geothermal and the unique characteristics of geothermal when they're when they're debating and discussing energy policy. Thank you, Brian. Now, we look at the international landscape. We go out of the U.S. We look at significant regions like Europe, Asia. Do you think the oil and gas infrastructure will be instrumental to transition into more base low low carbon energy? Do you think the national markets will actually follow the kind of trend innovation trends that is taking place in the U.S.? I think they will. Yeah, we're starting. I mean, Europe geothermal is take is becoming it's a exciting topic in Europe right now. Countries like Kenya and Turkey are leading in the geothermal space right now. So there's and the assets of the oil and gas industry are a critical part of the success of the geothermal industry globally. And we there's that is it's just a technological reality for that. These two industries work together in order to to address the climate crisis and also appreciate and the existing skill sets of of a well educated workforce that the geothermal industry needs to tap into to to scale and commercialize. Right. We are running out of time. So I would like to say thank you so much for your time today for the insights. I hope the audience is taking notes about what is happening geothermal, which is really good geothermal is hot. So we welcome all the questions on social media. Thank you so much, Brian.

Strengthening Knowledge Transfer in Unconventional Resources with Shauna Noonan,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Building the Bridge to the Future of Energy Engineering. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on April 5th, 2023. And now your moderator, Stefano Pruno. Welcome to this SPE Live on Building the Bridge to the Future of Energy Engineering. My name is Stefano Pruno. I'm the Regional Technical Advisor for Core Analysis at Stratham Reservoir. And I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions in the chat during the program. It is now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Zoya Hidari is an Associate Professor in the Hilderman Department of Petroleum and Geosystem Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Zoya has contributed extensively to the science of rock and fluid characterization and formation evaluation through integration of multiscale formation data. She has received many awards, including the 2021 SPWLA Distinguished Technical Achievement Award, the 2020 SPWLA Young Professional Technical Award, the 2019 EAG Ari van Velden Award, the 2019 AEME Rositer W. Raymond Memorial Award, the 2019 SPE Distinguished Membership Award, and finally, the 2017 SPE Cedric K. Ferguson Medal. Zoya has published more than 200 papers in peer review journals and conference proceedings. She has served as a member of the SPE Reservoir Advisory Committee and as an Executive Editor for the SPE Journal since 2022. As an Associate Editor for the SPE Reservoir Evaluation and Engineering Journal and Geophysics Journal. Zoya, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you very much, Stefano. Hello, everyone. It's a pleasure being here. Thank you, thank you. So Zoya, we know that the future of our energy transition will require a new generation of subsurface energy engineers, focusing on finding efficient and sustainable ways to supply the world with energy. So they will need to address new challenges, opportunities, and acquire specialist knowledge about conventional and renewable energy sources for power generation and storage. By combining, of course, traditional engineering principle and modern solution. And to develop, hopefully, a better understanding of the production and efficient use of existing energy sources. So can you please comment on what are the current challenges, based on your experience, that we need to address for core knowledge in unconventional reservoir? Well, let me start talking about the challenges related to the properties of unconventional rocks, as you mentioned. So the definition of unconventional obviously can be pretty dynamic, and depending on the existing knowledge and developments that we have today. Most of the rocks that we currently consider as unconventional, such as organic rich mud rocks, for instance, have some specific properties in common. And that we consider challenging at this time. So for instance, most of them might have tight core structure. We experienced complex mineralogy, complex rock fabric. And when we talk about rock fabric, what I mean is special distribution of solid and fluid components in the rock. And we might have a pretty complex pore structure. Presence of fractures also at multiple scales can add to the complexity of these reservoirs and affect core analysis efforts and in general formation, evaluation, reservoir characterization efforts. And we also experienced complex solid fluid interfacial interactions. And by solid fluid interfacial interactions, I'm talking about, for instance, properties such as vettability, cation exchange capacity. So these complexities in rock properties create some challenges related to measurements and also interpretation of those measurements. Now, let's talk a little bit about these types of challenges. First of all, let me start with saturating of the samples when we do core analysis. Saturating the samples with any type of fluid can be very difficult and it can be also very slow. It is hard really to guarantee that a rock sample is fully saturated. And then preparing partially saturated samples can also be more difficult. Impact of geochemistry is another topic that I want to talk about. And geochemistry can significantly affect the rock properties. And this impact might be unknown and it also might affect any type of measurement that we perform on core samples, anything related to fluid flow, even electric current flow, any type of measurement that we perform. Vettability and its alteration during coring and handling process can also affect different types of measurements that we perform that can add complexity to core analysis. And there are also no standard protocols and methods or very limited standard protocols and methods for integration of multi-scale core measurements, analysis and imaging. And office scaling is also very challenging because most of these unconventionals are known by their heterogeneity. There is a high level of heterogeneity in these formations and this makes office scaling even more challenging. Continuous data collection can be helpful in these conditions. However, this type of data is currently very limited. So all of these challenges we talked about can affect assessment of properties of these rocks, including permeability, capillary pressure, relative permeability and relative permeability endpoints. Or in general, any measurement that requires fluid flow in the samples. There will be loss of uncertainty in those measurements. They are hard and also time consuming. So all of these measurements can take months to complete depending on the level of accuracy we expect. And this is very different than the conventional reservoirs that we are used to. And also quantification of interfacial properties is another thing that will be affected, especially in the presence of complex mineralogy and heterogeneity in the sample. These are very important properties to quantify because they affect fluid flow. But we have lots of uncertainty in assessment of these properties in unconventionals. It's not only about fluid flow, they also affect physical measurements, such as electrical measurements. So in general, wettability is actually a property that is hard to quantify even in conventional reservoirs, depending on the level of accuracy we want to achieve. Right, wettability, restoration and even characterization techniques. So one more thing that I would like to add is the whole core analysis might be preferred depending on the level of heterogeneity in the samples. However, whole core analysis is often challenging and time consuming. Even core preparation and cutting a good quality core can be complicated and impossible in some cases. And meanwhile, crushed core analysis methods might create some level of uncertainty in core analysis efforts and also in larger scale formation, evaluation, reservoir characterization. One last point that I would like to highlight here is a high level of uncertainty in the measurements and also absence of the standards for core analysis or limited basically availability, which leads to absence of grounded truth in estimated raw properties in unconventionals. It has been very difficult to consider core measurements as a ground truth in conventional reservoirs, where we use them for calibration of every other interpretation. With all the challenges we already discussed here, it is hard to consider core measurements as ground truth. And this will affect the outcomes of reservoir characterization and production decisions in general. Therefore, I consider it as important to invest in development of new methods for reliable core analysis. Yeah, great. Thank you very much, Zoya. So this is a related question, of course. You know, what do you think about the need for developing new techniques for core analysis? Right. We discussed about most on tightrope, very challenging lithologies, you know, for from this unconventional reservoir, you know, that's an important, you know, development, these new techniques. Well, I absolutely believe that there is a need for development of new measurement methods as well as interpretation methods. Let's start talking about new measurement techniques and tools. Conventional measurement methods in general might not be reliable for tightrope rocks or some of them might be very time consuming, as we mentioned already. Examples include methods for permeability assessment or relative permeability endpoints. In general, any measurement that requires fluid flow in such rocks. Possible solutions are either changing the size of the samples in these cases or coming up with new measurement methods and protocols. And of course, we need to be mindful about sample size, especially in this especially heterogeneous formations, right? We cannot go very small sample size while we have a high level of heterogeneity. Another example, for instance, is the use of two megahertz NMR measurements for pore size distribution. That was very common in conventional reservoirs for pore size distribution and also for its characterization, which might not be reliable in organic mud rocks and tightrope rocks anymore. And in such cases, using high frequency NMR measurements are becoming a new normal in tightrope rocks in the lab. Another important point about tight and also fractured rocks is the importance of performing measurements under high pressure and temperature to represent in situ condition. Otherwise, we will end up overestimating porosity and permeability in some cases. And the uncertainty associated with the presence of fractures might not be negligible in tightrope rocks. Performing some measurements have not been a common practice in the case of conventional rocks, but it can potentially become a common practice in the future in the case of unconventional formations. I also believe in the need for development of new methods for performing measurements in situ condition in the subsurface before bringing the samples to the surface. Such measurements can be planned to be performed continuously, addressing some challenges related to formation heterogeneity. In situ, small size laboratories and nono sensors that travel in the borehole or in the porous structure might become new normal solutions in the future. We just need to think out of the box. We also need to develop, as I mentioned, new interpretation methods, new rock physics models and integrated workflows for interpretation of the data that we collect in the laboratory and also the data that we collect in the borehole to reliably estimate rock properties, especially when we deal with this complex rock fluid systems. Unconventional rocks are different than conventional rocks for which most of the existing rock physics models are developed. If the complexity of these unconventional rocks is not taken into account, we end up with excessive calibration of conventional models to fit their outcomes to what we believe the ground truth property is. And sadly, we might not even have access to a ground truth here. Instead, I believe we need to develop new rock physics models with physically meaningful model parameters for this particular complex systems. Then we can use core measurements for calibration of these models while incorporating uncertainty bars. And that's very important on lab measurements and interpretation results. Heterogeneity of the samples at the scale of measurement and analysis is also an important component to be taken into account in the interpretation of the collected data. Heterogeneity can be observed in several properties. Examples include pore structure, mineralogy, and variability. Heterogeneity in all of these properties and the level of heterogeneity can affect measurements and their reliability. And it absolutely needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of the seven, maybe in the measurement of the set. Yeah, thank you. So there's still quite a lot of work to do then. Yes, I agree. So now it's time maybe for a more heated question, but in your opinion, what is the role of Cornell's in the current green shift? There's a lot of discussion about energy transition. So what do you think what we can do? You know, well, a big portion of our current and future energy challenges and the green shift that we all have the opportunity of being part of are related to subsurface rocks and is very complex porous media in general. In my opinion, core analysis or in general term analysis of porous media is and will be an important component of any subsurface energy topic or any other topic relevant to characterization of porous media. And therefore, from my point of view, core analysis has important role in applications such as CCS, hydrogen storage, geothermal related applications. In all of these applications, we need to understand rocks, these complex porous media, and we also need to understand multiphase fluid flowing there. So characterization of some of these rocks, such as those related to geothermal systems, can be very challenging. We do have some existing techniques for characterization of such challenges, such complex porous media. But we do need to develop new measurement and interpretation methods. There is a lot we need to accomplish. And obviously, we need to be cautious of our environment when developing new methods and protocols for core analysis. This is part of the green shift and we have been always doing that. So we just need to think out of the box to tackle our new challenges that we are facing in our industry. And it can be hard sometimes, especially if you're used to methods which have been successful and have been working for our conventional reservoirs and applications for a long time. Living comfort zone can be hard, but it is needed for progress. It is always good to stop for a while and ask ourselves this question if there is any better method to solve this problem that I have and then think about what we need to achieve in that goal. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. That's very, very interesting. So, you know, does rock characterization for conventional reservoirs relate or can support the current plans for carbon capture storage, you know, hydrogen gas storage and loss, geothermal energy and all this activity related to, you know, energy transition and subsurface? You know, what is your opinion about? Well, characterization from my opinion, characterization of organic rich mud rocks are currently a big part of plans and developments for CCUS, hydrogen gas storage and geothermal energy. In the examples you mentioned, I can talk about some examples related to each one of these topics. For instance, let's start with talking about CO2 storage in mud rocks and use of CO2 injection as a mechanism for enhanced recovery. This is a hot topic these days. To assess CO2 storage capacity and to increase its efficiency, rock properties, including geochemistry, pore structure and absorption properties of these mud rocks need to be reliably quantified. It is important to understand how the chemical composition, thermal maturity, type of organic content in these organic rich mud rocks would affect CO2 absorption and how it would affect hydrocarbon production, because we are using this kind of technique for enhanced oil recovery these days. So the petrophysics side of it is very important to understand the problem and make it more efficient. Rock classification efforts can also contribute to enhance efficiency of such plans. We can have similar examples regarding hydrogen gas storage. Reliable characterization of soft surface rocks is not only critical for analyzing storage capacity and efficiency, but it's also important for understanding the sealing properties. Understanding sealing properties and also storage capacity requires understanding of the rock properties, petrophysics and rock analysis can enhance these efforts. And so fundamental research is needed for understanding this adsorption and diffusion of hydrogen as a function of pore structure as well as a geochemistry of solid fluid rock components. I can also give you examples about geothermal systems. In the case of geothermal systems, we most often deal with tight and fractured rocks. In situ and laboratory-based characterization of such rocks can be very challenging, similar to the case of organic rich mud rocks. New large-scale laboratory measurement methods and interpretation techniques are needed. When I talk about large scale, I'm not talking about an inch or one and a half inch type of measurements in the laboratory. I'm talking about block size measurements in the laboratory. Similar to the case of mud rocks. And given the fact that most geothermal efforts take place at very high temperatures, in situ assessment of rock properties would require development of new sensors, tools and measurement techniques. As we discussed in all these examples, the experience we have gained in unconventional reservoirs with some advancements can significantly contribute to the current plans and developments for CCS, hydrogen storage and geothermal energy. Yeah, that's also a very interesting development in our industry. Now, a question relating more to the future and the students. In your opinion, how academia can prepare students for these new challenges for the future of this energy, the future of the industry? What do you think? Thank you very much, Stefano. That's a very good question. We need to prepare students for these new challenges or lots of challenges that we talked about today. Addressing the challenges in this evolving field of energy engineering requires development of new tools and solutions for reliable characterization of subsurface rocks. This demands training engineers and scientists who can think out of the box, as we have been talking about today, to be able to develop sustainable and creative bridges to the future of energy engineering. And the question, the hard question is how can we do this? Well, from my point of view, instead of teaching recipes and workflows which work for certain problems and rocks, we can lead the students towards practicing how to approach a new problem and how to use the fundamental knowledge they gain in our programs in developing solutions for the new challenges they face. We need to train problem solvers and promote creative thinking because of the because the future of the energy engineering requires creative thinkers. Yeah, that's a kind of big challenge for everyone, right? Academia and service companies, oil companies, industry in general, try to find those solutions. It's very, very important. Yeah. Now we are going, maybe the question is more related to the digitalization part, the role of digitalization, automation, machine learning, because there is a lot of development also in that direction. Now that can help in the future of core analysis, energy engineering, in this transition period that we are into. Well, in my opinion, digitalization, automation and machine learning are inevitable components of core analysis in the future and currently as well. However, it's important to remember that having machines analyze collected data cannot replace the raw physics that needs to be involved in the interpretation and measurement process. For instance, when a measurement is not sensitive to fluids, I cannot expect the machine to use that measurement to estimate fluid saturation, right, and fluid viscosity, for instance. Or if a measurement is not sensitive to porous structure, I cannot expect the machine to use that measurement to estimate permeability. Machine learning methods can also be used to expedite decision making and analysis of data through automation. I believe this is a very important contribution of machine learning. An example for those applications is image analysis, for instance, which can have a great contribution to core analysis efforts in multiple scales. For instance, core and log scale automatic image analysis, for instance, CT scan images, raw image, raw score photos, automatic analysis of these images can expedite raw classification, little faces characterization efforts if combined with the experience of geologists and petrophysicists. This also enables heterogeneity quantification that we talked about in the very beginning today. Automatic selection of best-select intervals for core sampling, optimization, the number of core samples and the location of the core samples we collect in a given formation. These are all significantly contributing to core analysis efforts and can enhance formation, evaluation, reservoir characterization and production planning. One more example is, for instance, porous scale analysis. We can do this in multiple scales and this porous scale image analysis can be integrated with larger scale image analysis efforts for office scaling purposes and for development of reliable raw physics models for interpretation of the data that we collect. And if I want to summarize, from my point of view, machine learning methods should be part of the existing and future efforts for core analysis and formation, evaluation while honoring physics of the world. Yeah, yeah. So we have to think out of the box, but we also have to understand the black box of machine learning sometimes, to make sense of the physics behind and everything. Yeah, that's very, very important. I agree with you, Zohia. Yeah, now, of course, there is always discussion about how we can integrate and collaborate between different disciplines and develop this multidisciplinary approach for the new energy industry, because we have a lot of legacy from the petroleum engineering, the subsurface analysis, and we have all these new industry techniques, challenges. So what do you think about this? How do you think we can integrate and collaborate in an efficient way? Well, from my point of view, integration and collaboration are critical to address the challenges we have already discussed, as you mentioned. Well, in the case of integration, we deal with multidisciplinary problems here, and as we have discussed so far today, which require multidisciplinary teams and also integration. In my opinion, we need to develop methods for integrated analysis of core, core, log and reservoir scale measurements, as well as numerical modeling for data collected at multiple scale, while we take into account rock fabric and geochemistry. This requires integration. Collaboration is also very important. We need creative solutions for the existing and future challenges of our industry, such as unconventional formations, geothermal systems. Collaborating among the different disciplines can bring new ideas to the table and help expedite our progress in developing solutions. Yeah, that's very true. Let's see if you have some questions from the chat. Let me check. That's maybe a little bit also interesting for us. It's related to machine learning, quite high level of standardization. You know, that's also conventional, conventional reservoir. So how important do you think is standardization for the current developments? You know, in both core analysis or the transition that we are, we are experiencing, you know, for the current developments, you know. Yes, so we absolutely do need standards through joint efforts from multiple technical societies, such as SPW, APG, SCG. Integration is important, as we discussed. If you want to come up with a standard procedures with address, which can address all the challenges we have discussed so far. We also still experience huge range of variation in core measurements and partially because of the problem with the standardization in this kind of challenging reservoirs. Creating a standard procedures and incorporating uncertainty evaluation on core measurements, and at the same time, development of new methods can improve core analysis and consequently can enhance formation, evaluation and reservoir characterization efforts, which all depend on the core analysis industry. Yeah, yeah. So the last question, it's more a general question, but let's see if we can address this in a minute. So where do you think we are now and where we need to be in five years from now? Let's say maybe 30 years from now. We don't know how fast this is going to go. But what is your opinion about this? What is your feeling maybe also about this development? Yeah, well, as we discussed so far, fast computational capabilities have already affected our industry. We can see its impact on making some of the existing workflows automatic, which has enabled fast and in some cases, real time decision making. We can also see fast multi-scale numerical modeling efforts being incorporated in core analysis and reservoir characterization. Deep learning and machine and artificial intelligence in general are also being regularly used these days for decision making. I believe that we are going to see even more progress in the formation efforts in the upcoming years. And now that we are expanding our expertise and tools for analyzing and using data for fast and reliable decision making, it will be very important from my point of view in the future to develop more efficient and dependable unconventional methods and sensors and measurement tools for collecting good quality data. Because having good quality data in real time is important for the core evaluation in general. And these methods need to honor the complex nature of our challenging rocks, not only for the purpose of reservoir characterization, but also for being able to develop efficient and environmental friendly subsurface energy related strategies. Perfect. Thank you very much, Zoya, Professor Edari for sharing your knowledge and expertise with us today. On behalf of SBE and our presenter, many thanks for joining us today.

Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Digital and Physical Core Analysis, Data Comparison, Integration, and Challenges. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on August 9th, 2023. And now your moderator, Zoya Heidary. Hello everyone. Welcome to the SPE Live on Digital and Physical Core Analysis, Data Comparison, Integration, and Challenges. My name is Zoya Heidary. I am an associate professor in the Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. And I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will be about 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the program. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest, Dr. Dennis Clemmen. Dr. Clemmen is a Digital Rock Domain Champion at Schlumberger in Houston, Texas. He joined Schlumberger in 2005 and began his role concentrating on reservoir simulation, problems of oil, gas, and gas condensate flow behavior and sampling, and numerical and analytical modeling of oil recovery. The latter part of his career has been focused on reservoir characterization and managing and executing digital rock analysis, RCA, SQL, and EOR projects. Holding a master's degree in computer science and applied math and a PhD in geophysics, Dennis has published in a number of technical journals and holds patents for various innovations. In addition, he is also a member of the SPE Reservoir Technical Discipline Advisory Committee and its subcommittee, Core Analysis. Dennis, welcome to this SPE Live. Well, digital rock technology is a relatively novel approach in reservoir characterization and information evaluation. Therefore, there are some uncertainties in the petroleum and geosciences communities on what digital rock analysis means. Moreover, the deliverables of digital rock analysis may require new standards. So, Dennis, I would like to start with this question. How do you define digital rock analysis? Right. Thank you very much for the introduction, Zoya. And if we're talking about digital rock analysis, I would define it in two ways. The broader term that can define digital rock analysis is the combination of all the subsurface formation, imaging, and data processing methods that we have. That includes logging while drilling, wireline logging, borehole imaging, seismic imaging, and so on and so forth. And obviously, it also includes on imaging of rock samples on the surface. And with this, in a narrower term, I would define these rocks as the variety of the data points that can be obtained on the formation samples that includes the sidewall cores, the whole core material, the cutting material that we bring to the surface and image. And with this, the digital rock means that we build a multidimensional, multiscale digital description of those rocks. And then we also build advanced models of the specific reservoir fluids, the ones that are stored there or the ones that we inject that allow us in turn to compute various properties. And that includes fluid flow properties, mechanical properties, electrical properties, magnetic properties, acoustic properties, mineralogical data, and so on and so forth. And with this, I would like to mention a couple of things. Today, we're going to have an extensive discussion on digital rock. We're going to discuss the data integration, the benefits it brings, the challenges that come with it. But then also, I would like to stress out on the point of data comparison. Right. And then before we continue on with the Q&A session, I would like to show a couple of slides on digital rock comparison so that we will know what we're working with. And then also, it will help us to guide on what type of workflows we can employ in order for us to better implement these rocks into the conventional workflows and then move on with the digital transformation of our industry, of the core analysis industry. So then with this, I would like Alan to show the slides. Thank you, Alan. All right. So the digital rock analysis helps us to build on those multi-dimensional, multi-scale descriptions of the rocks. And then here you can see on some of the comparison between different imaging methods from left to right, from conventional imaging, such as the computer thermography done with the medical CT scanners, towards the high resolution imaging with the microcomputer thermography that can go as fine as a few microns or a fractional micron of resolution, and then towards the scanning microscopy. All of those imaging tools are helping us to in turn construct additional representation of those rocks. And then each of those tools also comes on with additional benefits. For example, the CT imaging can be done at dual energies and can be used as the high resolution log that can be then offset and overlaid with the existing well-login data. The micro CT imaging can be done at the confining stress so that we can see on how the stresses are truly changing the pore structure, confining out those pore spaces. The imaging can be also done at temperature, right? And we can preserve on the sample, let's say at the frozen state, if the sample is fragile or keep on the temperature, which is inherited for the formation. The scanning microscopy can be then also done together with technologies like AMICS or ChemScan helping us to get mineralogical data and then transfer this from the two-dimensional subset towards the three dimensions. And then if we're talking about digital technology, right? It is important to have a way to integrate it into the conventional lab analysis. But then also in the same time, we need to have the way to check and validate the results of digital analysis. And with this, here we can see on some of the exeperate workflow that we can employ on in order to clearly check the data we get from digital analysis. This workflow, as an example, consists of three steps. It starts on with obtaining the routine data. And again, the workflow is done in a blind fashion, so no data is available before that. After the point when we get on the data point, we compare it with the experimental data. So we obtain the routine data, we compare it. We see on whether the data that we have on hands coincides on with the lab information. Then on the next step, we get on the data analysis. Then on the next step, we go on towards getting and performing the scale analysis in digital space. And here are some examples. You can find the link towards the lower part of this slide. But the important thing to mention here, right, in digital analysis, we can replicate on the exact conditions of the physical tests with respect to the fluid data, flow rates, conditions, boundary conditions, specific pressure and temperature conditions. And then in turn, it helps us to also build on the models, which, for example, change in the way how they deliver the information about the pore spaces. From, let's say, the basic models that consist of, for example, one imaging data set, let's say the micro CT data, towards the advanced models, which enhance the information on those micro CT data sets with the high resolution imaging, either being nano CT or scan-chromicroscopy. In turn, it will give us the information that will extend and enhance our models and help us to become closer to what we have on in the physical tests. In turn, by employing all those steps and running the sensitivity studies where necessary on the unknown parameters, we are able to truly compare the data. But in order to do so, we need to have the modeling tool that allows us to perform the pore scale simulations with all those complexities of the fluids and the complexity of the pore geometry in a truly predictive manner. There are quite a number of methods available currently in the industry. Some of them have their drawbacks. Some are optimized for the specific subsets of the applications. This specific study I'm showing was done using the density functional hydrodynamics approach. And again, returning back to why we do this, right? The tools that we have are needed to be fitted towards the complexity of the fluids we have and the rocks. And it needs to be truly predictive, meaning that we need to model those flow processes at the pore scale. We need to consider fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interaction. We need to consider the specific phase state. We need to consider phase transition effects, the specifics of, let's say, chemicals or injectants that we're using. All of that requires an advanced modeling tool. And today, during the Q&A session, we're going to talk a lot about that. And with this, I would like to pass the word back to Zoya and we'll continue on with the discussions. Thank you. Thank you very much, Dennis. My next question is about the potential benefit of digital rock analysis. Well, we all know some conventional core analysis techniques can be challenging. And in general, analysis, this conventional analysis can be challenging in providing rock properties at reservoir conditions and also in complex or tight rocks. Well, my question is, can digital rock analysis fill the experimental gaps and improve the reliability and applicability of integrated core analysis, information evaluation, and reservoir engineering processes? Thank you very much, Zoya, for the excellent question. If you're talking about the challenges associated with the core analysis and for the sake of those of our colleagues which are joining the call today that, for example, have limited knowledge on the core analysis, I would like to quickly go through some of those challenges, right? And then we're going to go through the ways how we can overcome those challenges using digital rocks, right? So the first one is, you know, the mentioned challenge with working with the tight rocks, right? And most of the labs and lab guys know how challenging it is to work on with the samples that have the air permeability that is at the 1 millidar C mark and below that. If we're talking about those tight rocks and tight reservoirs, the issues that are associated with that come from several standpoints. First one is the pore volumes of those core plucks, of the tight core plucks, especially if the porosity is small, right, are quite tiny, which means that if we go on, for example, from the initial water saturation values, which can be quite high to the residual oil saturation, the actual window of saturation change can be quite narrow. And that means that we can actually have on, let's say, one or two cubical centimeters of, let's say, the actual fluid produced on in, let's say, experiment, right? But then the dead volume of the tubing that we can have on in our systems are easily of the extent of 10 centimeters and more, cubical centimeters and more. The other thing is obviously the flow rates. Are we going with the higher flow rates? Are we going with the lower flow rates? How we can affect and overcome the problems of the capyrean defects, especially for the low permeability rocks, if we encounter and work on with the, let's say, medium rates on those samples. The other issue assessed is associated with the sample cleaning. How we can verify on the endpoint saturations. If we actually don't have the full control of the way how we perform on the cleaning and the cleaning itself can be incomplete. And then also we come to the issues associated with actually honoring the residual conditions in those laboratory tests. Right now, as we are depleting our conventional, more or less easy to access targets, we are moving deeper and sometimes ultra deep to the ultra deep reservoirs that then have the complex hydrocarbon migration history. And this leads on towards the high or sometimes really high pressure and temperature conditions. The other type of the reservoirs are the ones where the seals were preventing the fluids to escape. And this results in additional compactment. And in result we have on the pressure states which are above the conventional pressure gradients that we observe on, let's say, for the nearby formations. In all of those situations, one of the main issues is that most of our equipment that we're using in the labs are graded to the specific working pressure. There's usually a maximum working pressure that is associated with it, which usually don't exceed 10,000 psi. So that means the working pressure from the working pressure value, we need to subtract the net confining stress. And for the deep reservoirs, it can go as high as 3000, 4000, 5000 psi and so on and so forth. That will leave us with the pore pressure of, let's say, 5000 to 6000 psi, which in many cases for those deep reservoirs is just not sufficient. And here's where the digital analysis comes handy. First of all, the digital analysis can employ the high resolution imaging that can be done under the stress conditions, which allows us to actually get on those net confining stresses that we have for those challenging formations and then see how they translate on towards the change in the pore geometry, not via the, let's say, indirect measurements, such as, for example, assessment of porosity of permeability. But actually by getting the digital copy at twin of this rock under the stress. And then the second part is when those conditions are then honored for the reservoir, the other thing is considering the fluids. And in many cases, the labs consider to use that fluids because again, they cannot match on the conditions for the life fluids or they have a limited amount of those life fluids. So then the life fluids can be then digitized towards the digital modeling and then utilized on in the workforce that we employ to actually get the digital data, the digital scale data or the digital petrophysics. And then with this, by employing the highest resolution imaging and do this in this nested multi-scale approach, we're able to get some information about the smallest pores. And in turn, for example, work on with the samples, which have, let's say a fraction of a million of the gas firms, let's say 0.001 and below. We can then also employed for the rocks, which, for example, are on the border edge in between conventional and conventional rights being under and closer to the nano-darsie scale of permeability. And the other thing is we have found the full traceability of saturation pressure flow velocities in those digital tests, right? This will help us to obtain on those not only the, let's say the scale data, such as the capillary pressure or the traceability, but then also to run on the petrophysical tests in the same time in getting the electrical properties, NMR response, mechanical test data and so on and so forth for the saturated rocks. At every single point when we are interested to get those parameters, which again in lab tests requires an additional level of tests, such as, for example, run PCI and the steady state probability permeability on different rocks on a sister samples or the same rocks. But obviously in the span of months and years to do so. So in turn, I would say that digital rock analysis have the unique role in this extent and it helped us to run on the tests on the samples, which otherwise will not be considered to be executed by other means. Thank you very much, Dennis. So my next question is about the procedures, established procedures. Do we currently have established procedures for integrating digital rock analysis deliverables into formation evaluation reservoir characterization processes? Excellent question. Again, and if we're talking about data integration, right. I would focus on, let's say, two main aspects of data integration. First one can be considered as sort of the basic one, right. That is, if we have an arrow primary goal is for the district analysis to match the scale and output of the conventional lab analysis. Then in this case we need to match the scale of the sample volume right which can be a sidewall plug, or the plug taking up from the whole core. In this case, those samples are needed to be honored right so we need to upscale the data we get on, like say on the high resolution data sets from the district analysis, all the way to the plug scale. Work on the same data data scale and provide on the results in the same or similar fashion, as we do in conventional way in the core analysis industry. Right. In this case, the data points from digital analysis can be directly used on in a similar fashion as we currently utilizing on let's say conventional lab analysis data sets, and then be honored by let's say integrated into the static and dynamic models. But then the benefits of the district analysis and in here I would like to again treat the district analysis has been much extensive than just the imaging of the course that we retrieve from the surface. The secondary goal is standing beyond that point right is where we upscale on beyond the scale of let's say of conventional core plug, we build on the world board scale models, we construct them using the virus imaging tools, let's say the bar hole imaging. The whole core imaging data sets the image formation that we get on from let's say advanced high resolution logs, all of that in combination, together with the core points where we actually have the individual samples taken and analyzed on for their, let's say scale properties can help us to construct on those well centric models, much the dimensions or the grid cell blocks that we're going to use on in our reserve models, and then in turn, allowing us to construct those bridges in between the digital core samples, and the one cubic meter 10 cubic meter grid cell blocks of the reserve models. So building the bridge towards the final different reserve models is where I see on the future of the application district analysis in helping to scale up beyond the conventional core. Thank you very much, Dennis, would you be, would you please share your thoughts on some of the advantages and disadvantages of digital rock analysis. Why should a company considering investing in incorporating digital rock analysis in their formation characterization procedures. Again, excellent question. And, and before going there, right, I would like to pinpoint on a couple of elements rights that associated with advantages and disadvantages of digital analysis, right. If you're talking about the pluses right the advantages, let's start with that. The advantages are obviously the fact that we can perform most of the skull tests using digital rock analysis much faster than in the lab. Some of the tests can be done orders of magnitude faster, especially if we're talking about tight rocks if you're talking about tests like porous plates that can take naturally a lot of time to stabilize on in the lab environment. The other point is the fact that we can actually increase the resolution of the studied models and go as fine as let's say focus on BMSCM imaging to get on towards the best details available to go on and work on with the tightest rocks. Right, so then with this we can tailor our program towards the specifics of the rocks we are studying. And then as I said, go on beyond the limitations of the lab analysis, either with the pore pressure, either with the net confining stress, either with the adjust the level of or the fact that we don't have live fluids for the tests. The other thing relates on towards the actual way that we control on the current sample state at each point. The fact that we can actually get and control the saturation, each and every time is quite important, especially if we can see the EUR, especially if we can see the let's say gaseous phases is for example working on with CCUS or CCS operations. All the stats are quite challenging for the lab environment and the fact that we can actually have a full control each and every time is crucial, which is obvious advantage. The other one is the fact that digital analysis can be integrated towards the conventional lab analysis program, which means that we can run on certain samples with the digital analysis, certain samples with the lab analysis and also have those samples on which we run both right in order to do the comparison. So then the integration can help on to speed up the conventional programs and run on the samples otherwise that will not be considered. But then in the same time, it help us to assess on some of the important institute parameters, such as for example, truly assess on the information on the rock with ability in the exact of let's say contact angles and range of those that we have on the in the sample. The other important parameter is, as I mentioned, the fact that let's say flow parameters can be also obtained on together with the petrophysical properties. So we can integrate on all those data points and then run on sensitivity studies in order to assess on how let's say changing the injectors will affect on the recovery in moving on from let's say conventional primary or secondary recovery towards the enhanced recovery and improved recovery schemes. But then obviously advantages also comes with the set of these advantages. So if we're talking about the minuses, the drawbacks of digital analysis, I would say there are quite a number of those right. First one is that the digital analysis relies on on the provider of the certain analysis of the one that performs on this test, right on selecting appropriate imaging methods and appropriate program to do the analysis. And in many cases on some cases, for example, the selected tests or selected imaging methods can be non appropriate or not sufficient to describe on the sample complexity. The other drawback comes on from the point that we need to have a specifics on we need to have a modeling tool that allowing us to perform this poor scale modeling with all the complexity of the rocks and the fluids. If we forget about let's say a complexity of the poor geometry, in turn, this will lead us to under estimation over estimation of let's say recovery factors. And we are losing the predictive ability of the tool. If for example, we forget about the complexity of fluids, we are no longer able to, for example, relatively speaking model, let's say a gaseous faces a miscible gas injection, bubble point dew point reservoirs complex real logical real job the phases and so on and so forth. So the tools, such as the poor scale simulator is quite important and it needs to be present. And then also, we need to run as I said, in many cases, especially for the large programs, the one to one comparative studies, in order to make sure that all the unknown parameters that can be present are tailored and taken into consideration. And then lastly, the digital analysis is a very important tool. And then also, we need to run as I said, in many cases, especially for the large programs, the one to one comparative studies, in order to make sure that all the unknown parameters that can be present are tailored and taken into consideration. And then lastly, the digital analysis, those models consist of billions of cells, those data sets we get on from the imaging such as the micro CT focus and be missing are huge. And in order for them to be fully integrated, and also considered at the scale that can be considered as a review or represent We need to run it on the larger data sets that can be a larger than the conventional let's say, full field 30 models that we utilizing. And then in this case, how performance computing is required and is a must. So then, while those disadvantages are quite crucial, right. And they actually increase the minimal entry requirements to start on performing digital analysis. The benefits are clearly suppressing those disadvantages. And I would say, especially when the time is of the essence in performing, let's say a conventional or extensive special core analysis and And as our industry transforms towards the future in the period digital workflows, the digital analysis help in this transformation. In turn, it helped us to transform our labs from being just pure core warehouses where we take the core and bring it back on the shelf to the digital data center where we save the digital twins of the samples that can be utilized on five, 10 years from now. And that is especially important for the projects, for example, at considering your or CCS or even the CCS where, for example, potential issues may arise 1020 years from now and the additional rock that was sampled can be already long gone. But the digital twin will still present there and can be utilized on five, 10 years from now. Thank you very much, Dennis. We have received some questions from our audience. So the first question is, what are the latest advances conducting experimental multiphase flow testing? Using digital rock physics technologies and micro CT in a specific Excellent question. So if we're talking about the advancements that we have on the industry rights, first of all, I would like to stress out the fact that we have a lot of work to do on the data and the data is very important. We now can consider let's say complex chemicals, we can consider the specific non constant composition in within the phases that we're modeling, we're able to model cases where we have a severe contact with the And then also the fact that we can now bring those tight rocks, especially the really heterogeneous and complex ones. Let's say that one, the ones that we take on from, let's say six kilometers deep formations and so on and so forth. And now can get the reliable skull data on the samples that previously were just sitting on the shelf. No one was touching them as then being non representative or non applicable for the skull analysis. I would say this is where the main benefits and the main advancements, recent advancements of the technology. Thank you very much, Dennis. Another question from audience. How to gain benefit from such analysis in innovating new drilling fluids like non polymers and reduce poor pressure transmission to stabilize micro fractured shale. How about fracturing fluids as well to not damage or reservoir formation. Excellent question again. So if we're talking about the fluid rock instruction, right, the fact that we can have on this advanced imaging together with the mineral assessment of the samples, allowing us to see the types of the clays. Let's say, for example, we have in a sample and whether we're going to have potential issues with those clays. As those fluids will be exposed on our towards them, right? So that this is one thing which is extending behind beyond, let's say the bulk XRD measurements we have on as the state of the art nowadays. So we can see whether we actually have those clays that will be in touch with the fluids. Second one, if we're talking about the drink fluids and in general, everything that relates on towards the drilling, the well stimulation programs. As I mentioned, one of the critical things is that in digital analysis, we currently are able to model fluids with the complex, logical systems. Models that includes on different types of polymers, different types of, let's say, in general, fluids that can inherit on, let's say, Hershey-Barkley, reology, elongation, reology, extension viscosity, reology, and so on and so forth. This elastic being one of them. All of those complex models allowing us to account on for the fluids, which previously we're not be able to either use on in the scale analysis as again, not all labs actually are able to employ on the fluids that can train on the solids. But then also allowing us to go beyond in understanding how, for example, the solids are transferred through the pore spaces. So it is a combination of the tools and advancements in the simulation that help us to truly run on those tests and optimize on parameters for, let's say, selecting the optimal drink fluids. Well, thank you very much, Dennis, for sharing your knowledge and expertise with us today. Do you have any final thoughts on how digital rock analysis fit into formation evaluation reservoir engineering processes that you would like to share with us? Again, thank you very much for inviting me and thank you very much for organizing this important event, right, that highlights on the importance of digital rock analysis and its future plans, right, the way how we can extend the conventional scale analysis. The things that I would like to say in the end, right, are related towards the way how we utilize the data, right. I would like to stress on the importance of digital rock analysis as again, Q&A tool for existing lab studies. In many cases, many of our companies, many of the energy providers, legacy producers have a lot of scale data present. In many cases, some of them claim on that up to 80% of this data can be rendered to be unusable or questionable. So then QC, the existing data, the legacy data is one of the things and ways where the digital rock analysis can be optimized and applied on. It can help to understand what went wrong, let's say in the digital test and then make it right. The other thing is the hybrid move workflows, where we run on the digital and physical tests in conjunction. This is important and actually help us to speed up the workflows. And ultimately, I would like to stress the importance of digital rock analysis for the CCS and CCUS operations. Many of the companies that are coming in this domain are new to the industry. Many of them don't know anything about the routine core analysis or special core analysis. And for them, the fact that you need to wait on a year or two years or three years to get on reliable data on the core in many cases means no, no. But as we know, in order to get an optimal plan for, let's say, the development in the CCS or CCUS space, you need to have this data. You need to have the ground-point truth data on the core samples. And the digital rock analysis can help to cover this gap for them in getting the data faster and then helping them to understand how this data actually transfer from the data to the core. Towards the reliability of, let's say, long-term stability of those CCS or CCUS pilots. Well, thank you very much, Dennis, again, for sharing your knowledge and expertise with us.

Thanks for Listening with Trent and Jason,"Hello everyone, I'm Trent Jacobs, the digital editor of the Journal of Petroleum Technology here at the SPE, and if you're tuning in today, you're going to be hearing from our very special guest, Greg Lavelle, who is the Chief Technology Officer at ConocoPhillips. Greg, I want to thank you for joining us. Yeah Trent, thanks so much. It's exciting to have a chance to be on SPE live and look forward to our conversation. Great, well Greg, let's jump right into it. You know, this is a unique period in the history of the oil and gas industry that we're all living through, and one aspect of it is that every oil and gas company is having to reassess or reduce their spending when it comes to things like R&D, which really affects our community because we're always thinking about technology. So how has that roadmap changed or not changed for you at ConocoPhillips? Yeah, so when you think about our technology roadmap, I'd say over the last three months when the pandemics really, you know, hit our industry, we haven't changed our direction to any significant degree, but if you look back further in time, there's been enormous changes. It's really been an evolutionary process over maybe the last six to eight years, and if you think about what's happened with our industry, I'd say really two things are really informed, how we look at the future and the roadmap for technology. One is recognition of how dramatic the change has been as far as perceptions around hydrocarbon abundance and also the digital revolution that's going on in the industry. If I say unpack those two a little bit, you think about hydrocarbon abundance, it wasn't that long ago that most technology roadmaps were focused on challenged resources, resources that, you know, frankly needed significant improvements in cost of supply to be cost competitive. So if you go back to the first decade after the start of the 21st century, you know, the focus of most of the R&D in our industry. Today we are laser focused on trying to take our low cost supply resources, make them even better. So big, big switch there. And then the other piece I'd say is, you know, I know there's a lot of talk about digital and, you know, it's almost perhaps being overexposed, but we really think that, you know, the 2020s is going to be the decade in which, you know, digital really comes into its own in our industry. It's almost like the 2010s were the decade of unconventionals. 2020s really going to be focused on digital improvements. And reflection on that for ConocoPhillips, three of our four big technology programs are digitally focused and the fourth one is really digitally enabled. So a lot of focus in that space as well. Well, I want to stay on this topic just a little bit longer because, like you said, it is such a big theme, especially since the last downturn. If we think about sort of a lot of the narratives that came out of that, one was that, you know, the industry has to turn towards digital to survive. And so a question that's coming out now, which I think is really relevant, is, you know, what have the prior investments gotten the business? So what did your, you know, your cost that you already spent on the digital transformation, how are they helping you now during what is widely considered a period of duress? Yeah, that's the question I think every company is grappling with, all the members of SPE. I guess I can think of three areas which, you know, are probably worth highlighting for this conversation. One would be around virtual communication and collaboration technologies, another around automation, perhaps a third one around data analytics. So, you know, if you look at the virtual communication and collaboration technologies, COVID-19 pandemic has really raised the status of having those capabilities inside your company. We are mostly a Microsoft Teams organization, and, you know, if you look back prior to the pandemic, we were using Teams to a, you know, moderate degree, but we've seen a six-fold increase in the use of the product. And it's not just using these types of tools to communicate like this, you know, they're not just video conferencing technologies. We're really using this to collaborate across organizational boundaries. So we are now able to basically connect people in various office locations. You might have someone in Alaska, Norway, Houston working together on a particular technology. They can do it real time. They can collaborate sharing files, modifying files, you know, there's just so much you can do, whiteboards, polling, et cetera, et cetera. So, you know, a huge opportunity for the industry. We've had to learn how to use these technologies under stress, but I think it's going to change the way a lot of things get done. So we're excited about that. One of the automation space, you know, with the COVID-19 pandemic having really caused everyone to think about how do we keep people distance from each other, you know, in many remote locations, we've had to demand the operations. So an operation which might normally have several hundred people on location, you know, might be down to a few tens of people. And we've been really pleasantly surprised by how effectively we've been able to run our operations with fewer people on site. And if you think about what's enabling that, you know, a lot of that has to do with the automation technologies that ourselves and other companies have been installing for the last several years. So, you know, the ability to, you know, remotely operate, work equipment with minimum amount of human intervention and have equipment that really is intelligent beyond just a kind of a simple on-off type of choice. So that would be the second one. And then data analytics is very complementary to that. So you think about what's allowed automation to occur at the scale that we've seen here recently. A lot of it has to do with the ability to take data, take data real time, understand what's happening and make decisions inside the machine, if you will, at a pace that's far faster than what humans could do. So data analytics is an area which is really getting a lot of focus, both in the automation space, but also things like, you know, how do we couple artificial intelligence with some of our traditional physics-based technology? So you think about digital twins, either reservoir simulation of the subsurface or, you know, how a facility operates at the surface. You know, we've been building physics-based models to simulate how the equipment works or the subsurface works. We're now starting to couple that with basically artificial intelligence and form models. And that's making a big difference to it. Learn the Well Log Signatures. Don't miss out on this great learning experience. Register online now. The energy and data webinars are powered by AAPG, SEG and SPE. You know, it's interesting. You gave some examples of sort of, you know, enterprise innovations and then some operational. And I'm curious, you know, I kind of have two questions on that. How do you balance those investments as an organization, you know, where you donate those dollars for digital transformation? And where do you see the bigger ROI? Is it on enterprise worker productivity or is it the fewer heads per well idea that's generating more value at the wellhead? Yeah, you know, I think it's kind of across that whole spectrum. You know, if you look at the unconventional business in the lower 48, you know, today, I think the industry's drill is somewhere just short of 150,000 horizontal wells that have been hydraulically fractured. Over the next decade, the industry is going to drill, you know, many, many hundreds of thousands more. So we're looking at a four to five times increase in the number of wells. So we're going to have to find ways to manage those type of operations without increasing the size of our workforce. So think about the number of workers required to manage both the placement, drilling and then operations of the wells. We just got to get better and better with time in order to remain low cost to supply producer. And then as you mentioned, there's a lot of things that you can scale across an enterprise. One of the things which we're really excited about is that we've been able to put more and more attention on trying to take technologies that have been successful in one place and bring them to other places. So some of the successes that have been achieved with operating centers, for example, in Alaska or Norway in the past, we've been able to bring that information or that technology to our operations in lower 48 and vice versa, been able to take advancements that we've achieved in the lower 48 and port those around the world. So we're moving into a decade, which I think is going to be incredibly complex for the industry. Things are moving fast, technology is changing, digital, that can be scaled very quickly once you find solutions that work. And with complexity, I think you just got to get better and better as a company at spreading technologies across the organization, adopting things quickly. One of the big themes we have right now is accelerated adoption, which is how can we, if you will, spike the curve on adoption so that we get it compressed to the shortest possible period of time. So I had a question about what are the trends that you expect to see in the future, and you sort of brought up a few of these actually. And I'm going to give you my take and then you can tell me how correct I am here. But it sounds like sort of what we've seen in the last four or five years since the last downturn is sort of a prelude to what you're predicting will take place to this next decade. Like you said, the digital transformation is a buzzy topic. It's somewhat controversial, big promises. The deliveries are sort of more nuanced, I think, than the broad marketing push of it. But what you're saying is that in the next 10 years, a lot of this will come together and will really be the digital transformation will actually happen. Yeah, you know, I'm very confident that's the case, just observing what's happening inside our company. So one of the things which has worked really well for ConocoPhillips is we aren't looking at the digital transformation as something which only digital workers coming out of university are going to be involved with. But this isn't just data scientists or people with degrees in computer science. A lot of our biggest successes, Trent, have been when we've been able to take our petroleum engineers and either one, they've kind of learned the skills to do some amount of data science themselves or couple them with a data scientist to attack some of the more difficult problems. And some of the successes we've achieved have been just absolutely amazing. I can think of one where we looked at how do you optimize completions in unconventional reservoirs? And the tradition has been let's get bigger completions, more sand, more propant, more fluid. Everything's getting larger and larger. But what we found was that when we actually went in and did some detailed data science work, bigger isn't always better depending on the conditions. So it depends on the price of the products that we're selling. So obviously, if you're at very high oil or gas prices, you want to get the most out of the entire reservoir. So you might move the wells closer together, put bigger completions in place. When prices are lower or costs are higher, you'll come up with a different plan. So we're starting to develop some deep, deep insights on how to optimize our overall businesses, well plans, development plans for entire fields. And a lot of this is being done, as I said, by our petroleum engineers. So I think what's really going to make the digital transformation really, really effective as far as lowering costs of supply, having a bottom line impact is that when we kind of can couple the kind of traditional technologies which we've been using in the industry with some of the insights you can get from digital.

Well, since you brought it up, a lot of the oil and gas world is wondering what happens to U.S. unconventionals. And so you brought up some of ConocoPhillips work, which we've reported on here at JPT, some very compelling stuff. Before we got on, we were chatting a little bit about the test site work at the EagleFird that we wrote about and featured in December 2019. But what do you foresee? Can you unpack this and get a little bit more detailed on how you see well designs, development strategies changing? And then also the big question is, are there any efficiencies left to drive out of the system? Or have we figured out 99% of it? Yeah, it seems like every 25 to 50 years, someone comes along and says that the world's discovered all the interesting technologies it can ever discover. And I can tell you, for unconventionals, that's not the case. There's still a lot to be done. You mentioned the test site in the EagleFird. This is where we had drilled a series of development wells, hydraulically fractured them, and then drilled multiple test wells through the hydraulically fractured reservoir to acquire core data, log data, pressure data. We had fiber optics in some of the wells. So we acquired an incredibly robust data set. And from that data set, we learned a lot about hydraulic fracturing. That's really helped us inform the approaches we're taking today. I think there's still more to do in that space because there's only been a limited number of these test sites. We did the one in EagleFird. There was an industry consortium that did one out in the Midland Basin. There's one going on today in the Delaware Basin. But we were just absolutely shocked by what we found, Trent. Basically, the geometries that the textbooks and computer-based models said should be there weren't there as far as the hydraulic fracture network and some of the characteristics of prop and distribution, and particularly how the stimulated rock volume drains with time. So the pressure data has just been incredibly informative. We shared some of that at ERTEC, the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference, but there's more to do. I mean, we're actually looking at follow-up projects in that space. We're looking at how do we use refracts to get more out of the reservoir. As I said, it becomes more important to get to a lower and lower cost of supply because if you believe oil prices may not recover to the level they were at as a result of the reduction in demand, you can start thinking about, okay, how do I change the development plan? So I think there's a lot for our industry to learn in the unconventional space. Our experience has been if you have rocks in the best part of the reservoir, in the sweet spots, if you will, you're going to be able to do things there that further lower cost of supply and basically make those types of opportunities more competitive. So I think unconventional reservoir is going to be coming back, but they're going to be in a world which is very, very competitive. All the other asset types are trying to find ways to improve as well. Yeah, it's a good point. It feels like there's been so much learned just in the past few years in the unconventional space. You would hate to think that all that progress is going to be slowed down. And so the here you speak, it sounds like there's still a lot of room for diagnostics and execution and the industry has built up some of this new knowledge to where some of these experiments or decisions can actually now be a little bit cheaper to go forward with. But the topic of the day is COVID-19. You know, it sort of dominated every aspect of our well-is these days. But if you just go back to January and the months before January, the biggest theme in this industry was commitments to sustainability. So we're talking about lower emissions programs and zero carbon targets and lower carbon targets. This has been another question. Has COVID changed those priorities? Can you speak to that from ConocoPhilip's point of view? Yeah, so you rightly mentioned that sustainability is something front and center for the industry. And that hasn't changed at all. And in fact, there's great technology stories developing in this space. Sustainability is a topic with a lot of different elements. And I might just highlight two of them. Greenhouse gas, particularly methane emissions from our facilities, well-head production systems, and also water sustainability. So if you look at greenhouse gas emissions, the industry has, for some period of time, been looking for ways to be able to monitor for methane emissions and do it effectively. And this is a tough problem. I mean, methane is a colorless, odorless gas. And it's been hard to detect. But the advancements being made in sensor technology and some of the automation I was talking about earlier really has opened up some new capabilities that you can be able to exploit. So we're very excited about this. We're working with technology companies, looking at satellite detection, aircraft-mounted devices, devices you can put on drones, on vehicles you can drive around in the field. And also, perhaps really importantly, is mounting sensors in the facilities themselves. So we're hopeful that with these technology advancements, we're going to be able to get to a place where methane emissions are going to be able to be identified very quickly. And really importantly, to be quantified accurately enough that you'll know when you have a problem which needs immediate attention. So that's happening. And I think that's going to be a big, big investment for the industry. Another thing I'd probably highlight, Trent, is that, frankly, the water side of the equation is one that's going to continue to get more and more attention. So if you look at the Permian Basin, for example, very, very large amount of water being produced on a daily basis. Industry needs to find a way to manage that. We were being really proactive looking at recycling technology. We recently had one really fantastic story where I think it's a microbubble flotation technology, which helps make the recycling process much more efficient and effective. Worked in the Permian, we were able to port that up to our Montney operations in Canada and get a good result there. So that ability to quickly transfer technologies around the company, find things that work, deploy them elsewhere, continue to help drive down cost of supply and improve the sustainability of our business. That's got to be the model going forward as we go into the 2020s here. Well, thanks for that, Greg. I'm smiling a little bit because as you're talking, I'm reminding myself that these are some of the technologies that we've reported on in JPT. So no shameless plug. We're just the ones reporting it, but you guys are the ones doing it. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members.

Greg, I wanted to come back to the SPE and walk away a little bit from thinking about operations and technology applications in that regard for EMP. What is your advice for SPE members who are faced with these challenging times? Should they be thinking about new skill sets? What is the most important thing that they should be doing to advance their career? When we look inside of ConocoPhillips, one of the things we are very aware of is that as we develop new capabilities, we're going to need the human capacity to utilize those capabilities. As I said, the industry is evolving very quickly. So I'd say continuous learning, up-skilling, if you will, is really going to be a focus for many companies and really should be a focus for many companies. In the data analytics space, I mentioned that we're really trying to arm our petroleum engineers, our geoscientists, our business people with those skills. Because we see them as being absolutely mission critical to being successful in the years ahead. Frankly, I'd ask all the SPE members to think about what can I do to become more digitally aware and work with more digital technologies. It's not to say that our traditional technologies, the reservoir engineering, the production engineering, capability, and the ability to do that, but I think that we're really trying to arm our petroleum engineers, our geoscientists, our business people with those skills. It's not to say that our traditional technologies, the reservoir engineering, the production engineering capabilities are diminished in value, but being able to couple digital with those core technologies, I think that's really going to be the secret sauce as far as companies may be able to continue to advance their ability to lower cost supply, get ahead of sustainability issues, and companies need those type of capabilities. It would make sense for the members to really focus their time and energy on developing those capabilities themselves. Okay, well thank you, Greg. I want to open it up to the Q&A session here. We have about 10 minutes for that. The first question that came through that I thought was pretty interesting takes us back to technology and keeps us in the digital realm. Can you talk to us, Greg, about what you think about producers embracing open data, open source tool sets to advance industry efficiency? This is something that we've seen take place in other industries. How is that going to work out in this one? Whoever asked that question obviously understands that the more data you have access to, the more likely it is you're going to be able to develop deep insights. I think one of the challenges for the industry is how do we go about sharing key data sets such that the industry as a whole can make advancements as quickly as practical. We are actually a fairly fractionated industry. If you compare us to most other industries on the planet, we have far more players in the industry than most others. The ability to get access to data that allows you to see the bigger picture is going to be important. Some of the things we're doing, we're investigating data sharing consortiums. We've got one going up in the Bakken with WoodMAC where they've got a selection of operators together who have agreed to share data that isn't in the public domain so that all of the operators can get a better understanding of how to optimize well designs in the Bakken and best operate the wells. I think you're going to see more and more of that. You're seeing a lot of data gathering services, if you will, so services that go about and gather up all the data in the public domain, some of them doing analytics on those, making those available to companies. You don't necessarily need to be a big company to gain access to some of these tools and capabilities, but the industry really does need to find ways to do this because in the final analysis, we're not just competing with each other. We are competing with other sources of energy and frankly, we've got to keep driving down the cost of supply for oil and natural gas. I've used that term a lot. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, it's the price you would need to receive for the sale of your product to get a 10% or higher rate of return, or at least that's the way we think about it. So if you drive down that cost of supply point, you can make a good return at a lower and lower product price. We think that's going to be the game that the winners are going to play in the 2020s. Whenever low prices come back to this industry, certain segments of it suffer more than others. I had a couple of questions come in about the deep water sector and then also EOR because we know this is an area where, and I'm specifically referencing unconventionals or shale EOR here, which is something that takes us back to your technical work in the EagleFord. Can you comment on how this next round of lower for longer affects those two segments of the business? Yeah, so in the shale space, a number of companies are engaging in EOR projects, most of them in the EagleFord, but in some of the other places, there's been efforts underway now for some time. We're seeing, I think the industry is seeing some mixed results. I mean, the ones we've seen that have been successful, you've been able to contain the gas in a relatively small area. The ones that haven't worked so well, you know, if you have a fracture network that extends across the base and you just can't pump up the pressure in a small enough area to have an impact. So I think there's a lot of things yet to be done in that space. With many other aspects of unconventional, a lot of the initial approaches to things like EOR have been, you know, let's take a technology we used in conventionals and see how it works on the conventionals. And perhaps the better question for unconventional EOR is, are there some alternative approaches that really are customized for the type of system you're dealing with there? You know, in the deep water, Conical Phillips pulled out a deep water exploration and development several years ago now, almost half a decade ago. And that was really a part of this evolution of our overall technology strategy and our company strategy. As I said at the outset, you know, 10 years ago, Conical Phillips was looking at a number of challenge resources. Our peers around the industry were doing the same thing. People were looking at gas hydrates on the north slope of Alaska, developing oil offshore in the Arctic and areas where there was sea ice on the surface six to nine months out of the year. Oil shale in Colorado, that's where the oil is locked in the rocks and it has to be, you have to heat up the rocks in order to extract those oils. When we looked at deep water, we thought that was going to be a relatively high cost of supply for them to be engaged in. So for our company, we made a strategic decision. That was a hard decision because Conical Phillips has been in the offshore since the beginning. We went into the offshore right after World War II. When I joined the company, I joined Conical in the early 80s. It was an offshore company. And of course, deep water today is the frontier in offshore. That's where most of the new big discoveries will be made. But we are really taking to heart this view that you need to have the lowest possible cost supply to be a winner in this industry. It's not to say there aren't going to be good deep water discoveries. And you look at some of the stuff like off Guiana, exceptional results. But we thought that overall it wasn't going to be a game we were going to want to play or be able to play. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

SPE membership gives you the opportunity to make local and global connections and build a network of influential technical leaders from every discipline. Learn more at SPE.org slash join. If we take things back to, you know, unconventionals for a second, you know, there's been a lot of talk about pressure monitoring these days. This is something that we've reported on heavily at JPT because we were looking for, you know, sort of that next evolutionary step change, if you will. And the pathway leads to something called real time fracturing or on the fly fracture design. This has been a big topic in the completions community because especially amongst the engineers who are really striving to, you know, improve these designs and lower capital costs for these wells, move us away from cookie cutter designs. Could you offer us some thoughts or a prediction on the future in this respect? Is real time fracturing going to change the business in the next, you know, several years? Yeah, I think it is. I mean, when you look at the capabilities that are being developed as far as sensing technology, automation, you know, you start thinking about how can you apply that when you're pumping a hydraulic fracture away? You know, we know that the rocks talk to us. You know, the rocks tell us about what's happening down hall. It should influence how we, you know, design, if you will, the fracture stimulation job. So, you know, I think monitoring what's happening real time and then having the capabilities to understand based on what the sensors are telling us what we should do is going to be an area with a lot of opportunity ahead. Trent, you know, the whole completion space, I think, has a lot of opportunity for automation, both on how you go about mechanics of hydraulic fracturing as well as the down hole side of it. So perhaps drilling is a bit further ahead in that space. We've seen enormous advancements there. You know, we've been so excited about that, but completion is following not too far behind. Yeah, it's interesting to hear you say that. I've been waiting for other people to sort of raise the point that we've seen so much advancement on the real time data acquisition and actionable insights in the drilling side. And yet that has not moved stepwise with completions. But now in the last year, we're really starting to see some concrete developments there that I think will be just as exciting as what we saw in the real time drilling space. Yeah, so, you know, we're working in a high tech industry. Many people on the outside don't visualize it that way, but the technologies that are being deployed and the advancements those are creating are really amazing. Well, Greg, yeah, I really appreciate you giving us a half an hour of your time now. We're going to wrap it up. But did you have any final thoughts on sort of we talked a little bit about some advice that you would give to the average SBE member. But was there a parting thought that you wanted to give everyone? I hadn't thought about that beforehand, but I guess, you know, if I was to pass on what I'm passing on to the ConocoPhillips employees, it's really to continue to upscale your capabilities, stay focused on learning, developing and broadening your network and relationships, and then stay optimistic about the longer term future. This is an industry that goes through big ups and downs. We're in a down period right now, but the industry will come back stronger as long as we keep innovating and finding ways to improve upon what we do. Well, thanks, Greg. We will be sure to keep our chins up. With that, I want to say stay healthy and safe and goodbye for now. Thanks again, Greg."
The Way Ahead with Jeff Spath and Jennifer Miskimins,"Welcome to the SPE podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, rising to the challenge of the constantly changing world of work, a conversation with Brian Krause. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on July 8th, 2024. Welcome to this SPE Live, rising to the challenge of the constantly changing world of work, a conversation with Brian Krause. My name is Sue Staley, and I am the sustainability director at the BPSI Group LLC. I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes, and we encourage you to ask questions throughout the live event. You can post those in LinkedIn and on Energy Stream. It's now my pleasure to introduce our guest. Brian Krause is an acknowledged expert in the field of health and safety leadership, culture, and performance transformation. He has been instrumental in developing a range of innovative approaches, which deliver dramatic reductions to incident and accident statistics and broader operational performance improvement. Brian has worked closely with the C-suite and senior leaders of many of the world's most successful companies, their frontline leaders, and HSE professionals over 25 years working in this field, inspiring and equipping them with the practical skills to deliver rapid and sustained improvements in HSE performance, operationalizing human and operational performance principles. He founded and for 10 years served as CEO of ERM's accredited EHS management systems certification and verification service entity, ERMCBS, driving the development of innovative leadership, behavior, and performance focused approaches to audit, which helped clients achieve step change improvements in their EHS performance. Brian is a member of faculty for the Society of Petroleum Engineers Safety Leadership Academy and holds a degree in mechanical engineering from Trinity College Dublin and a master of business administration from London Business School. Brian, welcome to this SPE live. Hi Sue. Hi, it's good to see you, Brian. Great to see you. How are you this morning? I am fantastic. Great. Looking forward to this conversation. Okay, so yeah, this is going to be quite an interesting conversation because ERM has recently published a survey on safety performance and there are really some interesting insights that come from that study. And so maybe the first question is, what are organizations doing with these insights? Good question. And I'm not sure I know the full answer to it, but I have some inkling and some views. But maybe I'll provide a little bit of context first, Sue. So the study that I had, the Honor of Leading, is the third in the series. We did a similar study in 2018 and a further one in 2021. So the 2024 study is the third in the series. And what we did is we had one-on-one conversations with a structured set of question set with 256 health and safety function leaders from companies that collectively employ over 11 million people. And I think 11% of the participants were from 12% from oil and gas companies. And we followed up these one-on-one engagements and got a huge amount of data from these conversations with these health and safety function leaders. By the way, most of them, 65%, were the senior most people working in the function for their organizations. And then we followed up these initial one-on-one engagements with a series of roundtables where we had the participants engage in the preliminary findings. And we then did a substantive kind of further deep dive on the insights that came from the interviews. So the insights from in the study are not from ERM. They're from 256 of health and safety function leaders who collectively have revenues equivalent to 10% of global GDP in 2022. And we really believe these are amongst the most informed people in the world. They will have, in fact, did many of them dealt with multiple fatality situations in the last three years. They will have spent invested in significant programs to deliver step changes in their safety performance. Many of those will have exceeded their expectations. And actually, they told us so. Others with the same kind of data, they will have done a lot of research. So what we did is we took the insights from these individuals and synthesized them into a body of findings. And it has been an honor to have led this and the prior studies. And I suspect that a number of people who participated in the study are on the line to do that. So we owe them a huge vote of thanks. So it's just in terms of the broad conclusions. And then I'll come to the specific question you answered. So what we've I mean, this came through from the research that we've done, and I think it's a very interesting question. So what we've I mean, this came through really in a very unambiguous way from the whole data set. It's all about how people engage in the work. And if people engage in the work in the right way, you get the right outcomes, you know, in terms of production, maintenance outcomes or whatever it is. And everybody gets to go home safely at the end of the day. If people engage in the work in the wrong way, you know, the chances are that, you know, lots of things happen, including people ending up not going home to their families intact. So it's all about how people engage in the work. And the world of work is going through this massive transformation. So the composition of the workforce is changing. And we got significant kind of data from the study about that. But we looked elsewhere as well. So 27 percent of the workforce in 2025 will be millennials and Gen Z. And the participants in the study talked about specific challenges to do with that demographic and other challenges to do with the demographic. Fifteen percent talked about attrition. So loss of experience and knowledge at a significant level. So 15 percent is 50 or so health and safety function leaders talking about that as a concern. Sixty three percent of the cohort are anticipating that there will be a greater use of contractors over the next five years. Others talked about, you know, the shift of work to other jurisdictions. So that's the composition of the workforce is changing in a significant way. The nature of the work is changing. Fifty percent talked about challenges, positive and benefits, but also challenges to do with the uptake of automation and rural development. Twenty seven percent of the cohort talked about being engaged in new activities. So new risk profiles and a whopping 72 percent shared with us that there has been a significant shift in their risk profiles over the course of the last three years. The actual nature of the work is changing. And we've seen that in the last five years. So 20 percent of the workforce in the United States in August 2023 worked remotely. If you look at a comparison statistic for year 2000, it would be less than one percent. And 88 percent of the companies who participated in the study have worked remotely. So that's one percent of the companies who participated in the study have at least some of their workforce working peripatetically. So working, traveling from from from site to site. So, you know, all accounts, the the nature of the work is the world work is going through some sort of change in the way that the data itself is not new. I think what has happened is that there's been a real acceleration in the way in the in the changes in the world of work over the course of just the last few years. And in a way, not in a way, I mean, it's coming through from the data that it is organizations capacity to be changing. And so the changes in the world of work is kind of in a way accelerating away from organizations. So what we found, and I was looking at the data this morning for the oil and gas sector specifically, and this is true of the sector like it is for really across the board, that the function leaders have downgraded their capacity of the extent to which their health and safety functions have the capacity and capability to address the changing needs of their stakeholders. So we asked the same question in the twenty twenty one survey, asked it again in in our engagements for this for the year. And there's a significant shift downwards in terms of how well equipped the health and safety function is. Now, that isn't because the health and safety functions have become less capable by no means. It's just that they haven't been able to keep pace with the changes. So we found in and we might share some other data in this regard a little bit later in the conversation that, you know, for organizations as they seek to deal with these changes are are immensely challenged and more of the same. And so we believe that organizations, the data call for organizations to really pause and have a substantive reflection on what approaches they will need to adopt going forward to enhance their capacity to protect the health, safety and well-being of their people and work, acknowledging that. That some of the key performance metrics suggest to us that performance is deteriorating, not getting better. Well, it sounds, Brian, like like within the last few years, there have been quite significant changes in the world of work and in the complexity of of the working world. And when I heard you say that the the HSE function has sort of downgraded its own ability to keep pace with these changes, that's quite alarming to me because here you have this this important function being relied upon by their organizations to be able to deliver and and they're seeing themselves as not being able to do so. Do you does the study offer insights for what health, safety and environment function leaders can do to help, you know, this this radically changed complex and working environment that we're in now? So one of the questions we asked the function leaders was to call out their top concerns for on health and safety at this time. And one of their top concerns is really the capacity and capability within the function. So there isn't just an issue with the capability in the function and that is capability to address the extent and breadth of of the challenges in the field. There are also significant challenges with capacity. And that's really true across the board, across across geographies and across sectors. And it's true also for for the oil and gas sector. So what are organizations doing? The primary thing that they're doing is investing in the capabilities in the in the function. And the primary focus of that is on developing the leadership capabilities of the people working in the field, in their organizations. But, you know, they're there, you know, I think kind of steady as she goes is is is not doesn't look like that's that's the answer that that will deliver sufficient improvement in capacity and capability in in the function to allow organizations to better address the challenges. Going back to the question you were asking earlier on, I think, is that the capacity and capability of the people working in the field is not necessarily the same as the capacity and capability of the people working in the field. I think that's the challenge is going back to the question you were asking earlier on. I mean, we are hearing some organizations that we've been engaging with around the the insights from the survey who really are taking a significant kind of step back. But if I look at it across the board, my my own view is I don't think there is sufficient in the way of really substantively informed dialogue within organizations about, you know, how do we address this scale of the scale of the challenges? So some are doing it. But I think it's not nearly sufficient across the board. So I would hope that the data and insight from from the study will help organizations appreciate what the scale of the challenges are, and they can use the data to engage with their own stakeholders and then, you know, convene groups of stakeholders, not least the, you know, their peers in the function within their own organizations to use these data and insights to take advantage of the data. What does better look like? What does enhanced capacity and capability not just in the function organizational capacity and capability to address these challenges look like? Yeah, I do want to ask the next question about leadership engagement in the front line. But first, I just want to remind those who are watching online the streaming option, if you do have questions, feel free to ask them. We will be answering audience questions as well as we go along. Okay, so the next question, I'd like to follow up sort of on the theme of, you know, we talked a little bit about the HSE function and its capacity and capability and its focus on leadership. But what about the front line and all levels of leadership with leadership? You know, there's, I do know that organizations do put emphasis on leadership engagement at the front line, you know, some more than others. And it's been identified as it's been identified in previous surveys as driving performance improvement. And yet, we're not seeing the results of that pan out in actual performance. So I'm just wondering, why do you think that broad based increased leadership engagement isn't translating into the performance expectations that we have? Yeah, so this was this was a fascinating one. So we asked an open question in the 2018 2021 surveys where what what did these safety function leaders believe is the key to driving the most effective way of driving improvement in health and safety performance? And, you know, circa 80% of the participants in those studies called out leadership and especially leadership engagement on the front line as the most effective way of driving improvement in their performance from their perspective and drawing on their performance. So we asked a slightly different question this time to kind of validate the data. And here's the question we said put in front of them. We found in the past that the data was very, very important. And so we asked the question, what is the most effective way of driving improvement in their performance? And what is the most effective way of driving improvement in their performance? And 87% said they agreed with that statement and then 5% said they somewhat agree with that statement. And that's a massive statistic. And so we asked the question, what is the most effective way of driving improvement in their performance? And we asked a slightly different question this time to kind of validate the data. And so we asked the question, what is the most effective way of driving improvement in their performance? And then 5% said they somewhat agree with that statement. And that's a massive statistic in a study like this. So leadership engagement, and this is from other data from the engagements for the 2024 study, identified as the number one on the list of factors underpinning improved performance. And so the number one thing that health and safety function leaders will just do more of or do differently was to have more engagement with leaders in their organization. But here's some other data. If you look at the various levels of leadership in the organization, only 8%, despite the fact that senior leaders are engaging more, only 8% believe that their senior leaders are engaging sufficiently on health and safety. So here's part of the answer. 5% only believe that middle management are engaging sufficiently on health and safety and perhaps the most alarming. Only 7% believe that their frontline leaders are sufficiently engaging on health and safety. And then, you know, then the scores for the effectiveness of leaders engagement on health and safety suggests that there is massive potential for leaders at these three levels, senior leaders, middle management and frontline leaders. That they were there's a potential for them to have much greater impact in their engagements. So another data point would suggest that there's a challenge in this space. 84%, again, a huge number told us that there is a material, not trivial material difference in risk tolerance between the from the top to the the frontline in their organization. So between senior leaders and the frontline. So a material difference in risk tolerance between those who are responsible for defining what is an acceptable level of risk and those who are actually engaging in the risks. So somehow, leaders senior leaders messages are not getting through to the frontline in terms of what is an acceptable level of risk. So from this and from the prior studies. So it is about, you know, there's an issue about the quantity of engagements and there's an issue about the scale of effectiveness. So the how leaders are engaging 86% of the cohort are actually planning to, which is the good news, to invest in in leadership in their organization. So they have all established are planning new programs to enhance leaders capabilities so that so that they can have a better understanding of leadership. So they have all established are planning new programs to enhance leaders capabilities so that so there is getting a more impact from the engagements that they do have on health and safety. But this is, you know, often organizations focus their metrics around leadership and great engagement around the quantity of engagements. And of course, that's what people focus on on delivering on the metrics. So that's that is that is a real challenge. And from our own my own work in this space. You know, there's different sort of sense of what is the impact of the metrics on the impact of leadership. And from our own my own work in this space. You know, there's different sort of sense of what leadership. And this is not this leadership at every level. What leadership engagement ought to be about. I think organizations get the best results where it is purposeful. And it is directly about how people are engaging in the work and the hazards arising from the from from their work and not just to kind of a social kind of connection with people that there's more in the way of purpose. That is not to say that there is real merit in leaders connecting and, you know, being, you know, engaging for the sake of engaging. That is, is a positive thing. But if you want to do you want to engage in a way which is about driving improvement in performance, then it has got to be real real focus on how people are engaging in the work. And I mean, there's great kind of knowledge and capability and insight coming from other aspects. You know, there's this sort of whole Japanese manufacturing thing around leaders spending time at the Gambia. But, you know, spending time at the Gambia is about leaders looking and observing deeply. So I think there's opportunities for organizations to adopt, not just here in other respects, you know, thinking from other organizational aspects, which they can use to enhance, you know, the quality of leaders engagements and what is derived from it and ultimately to have more impact in the way of of performance. Brian, we just have a few minutes left and there was the towards the beginning of our conversation when you were talking about all the changes that have happened in the last few years. And when we talk about risk and how that risk is perceived and managed, how are companies because another aspect is the company can can do the work all themselves and then they own all that risk, but they can also hire others to perform activities for them. And then the risk sort of gets shifted away from the company onto a third party. That happens a lot in our industry because we have service providers, we have drilling contractors, we have, you know, others who are participating in in the efforts. And so the risk sort of gets spread across these companies. How do how do all of these entities deal with that, that risk management? And and so are we talking about all these companies? Are we talking about just the producers? How how are we when we define how the risk is being managed and how do we know how well it's being managed, especially when you get a third party involved in there? Yeah. So look, I mean, we this is one of the aspects that we looked at in all of the three studies. So we're getting a bit of longitudinal data around it. So organizations are anticipating 65 percent actually of the cohort are anticipating that they will make greater use of contractors over the course of the next three years. And, you know, for the oil and gas sector, that's often very high base. And that is true for for the oil and gas sector as it is for for other sectors as well. So a migration of more work into the contractor base means the migration of risk into the contractor base. We've also found and again, this is probably especially true for the oil and gas sector, the sort of perspective that contractors are going to be able to do is to be able to do a lot of work. The sort of perspective that contractor health and safety is harder to manage than health and safety for their own employees. So this kind of compounds the, you know, the the extent of the challenge, not just is more risk migrating into the contractors. Also, contractors are harder to manage and very much so. More than I think any other sector, the only gas sector health and safety function leaders believe that their contractors are undertaking more risky and significantly more risky work than their own employees. So it's kind of on three counts. There is it's exacerbating the scale of the challenge, which would go some way to explain why organizations are taking a more hands on approach. So this sort of era where people have because of sort of genuine concerns about confused liability and historically people may have taken a more hands off approach with their contractors. It seems that organizations are moving on from that sort of philosophy or approach and, you know, increasingly integrating contractors into their own own programs. So less substantive differences in how they engage in health and safety with their own employees and with their contractors. There are other sort of aspects in the study where, you know, organizations talk about how shared insights, which we've included in the report about the sort of approaches that they are anticipating that they will use over the course of the next three years to enhance their contractor safety performance. It's interesting. So there are over 500 fatalities reported across the cohort. And, you know, in Lime, that's much higher than the other studies. And also, if you look at the data for in jurisdictions in the United States, in Germany, France, Spain and other places, the number of fatalities of work has increased over the last decade. And the rate also has got higher. So you're more likely to be killed on the job at work in the United States and in Germany and other jurisdictions now than you were 10 years ago. As 65 percent of those fatalities that the participants shared with us occurred to contractors. So disproportionately, contractors are ending up on the wrong part of it. So I would again would go some way to explain why organizations are doing more and adopting a much more hands on approach in this space. Well, it's very sobering, Brian. And it's such an interesting study. I encourage people who are watching this event to go out and read the study. Unfortunately, we are at the end of our time, believe it or not. That went so quickly. I do just want to add one final comment. I'd like to thank you, Brian, for participating today. It was a very interesting conversation, very sobering. And it just reminds us there's so much to do in regards to health safety environment in our industry. And there is an upcoming international conference. SPE is holding the next edition of the International Health Safety Environment Sustainability Conference. It will be in the September 10 through 12 in Abu Dhabi. So hopefully you will have our audience will have a chance to come and listen and hear more about these topics to encourage everyone to do that. And with that, we will close this SPE live. Thanks again, Brian. Thank you. Thank you, Sue. And thank you, everybody out there. I hope it was helpful. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast.

Drilling's Digital Ecosystem with Tommy Sigmundstad,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live Gaia Talk, Rigs to Reefs, from oil production to ocean habitat. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on September 13th, 2023. And now your moderator, Duane Purvis. Good morning and welcome. My name is Duane Purvis and you are now attending SPE Live Gaia Talk on Rigs to Reefs from ocean, from oil production to ocean habitat. My name is Duane Purvis. I am the founder and principal advisor of Purvis Energy Advisors. But more importantly, we have with us two experts. It's my pleasure to introduce our guests, Amber Sparks and Emily Hazelwood, who are both marine scientists. They started out together at University of California San Diego's Scripps Institute for Ocean, Institution of Oceanography. And then together they founded Blue Latitudes, which is recognized as a leader by Forbes and Entrepreneur Magazine and a beautiful spread in National Geographic as leaders developing creative, sustainable and cost effective solutions for environmental issues that surround the offshore oil and gas industry. They're also co-founders and co-presidents of Blue Latitudes Foundation. Together they're committed to elevating the scientific understanding of our oceans in communities around the world. And together they've led scientific research expeditions, supported the production of documentary films from Malaysia to the Kingdom of Tonga that highlight opportunities for conservation at the intersection of industry and the environment. Good morning, Amber and Emily. Welcome. Thank you for being here. Thanks for having us. Good morning. So I think we're coming in from all over the country today and glad to talk about an issue that affects not just the US but a lot of other countries. And I understand from reading the talking we've done that you guys have worked a lot of those. But first, tell me the background. So you guys went to the Scripps Institution, which as I understand it is pretty much the combination of Harvard and MIT for the purpose of marine biology. So I can't imagine that you started out your career wanting to support oil and gas, wanting to work with oil and gas. Tell me about where you guys came from and how you got to this place. Of course. Yeah, no, it's a funny question because people ask that of us a lot. And no, I did not grow up as a little girl wanting to study oil platforms. Me neither, of course. My interest in the program, I'm originally from New Hampshire. I live there now. But my interest in the program stemmed from right out of undergrad, I had the opportunity to go work on the BP oil spill. I graduated in 2011. So for me, that was a very big event. This spill happened in 2010 and it was still very much ongoing by the time I graduated in the spring. And so I got an opportunity to go down there and work as a field technician working on studying the biota, the marine life, as well as sediment and the water and understanding the full extent and impact of the spill. And while I was down there, we worked with a lot of local fishermen who would drive our sampling boats around. And every time we'd be out there, they'd be talking about how they couldn't wait for the weekend so they could get out there and go fishing on the oil platforms. And at the time, that seemed bizarre because from my perspective, wasn't one of these oil platforms the main cause of this oil spill? Why would you ever want to eat fish that came from an oil platform? And so that was the first time I learned about the rigs to reach program and what a pivotal role it plays in the Gulf of Mexico in terms of supporting fisheries and the vibrant ecosystems that are actually found on these offshore structures. So when I decided to pursue my graduate degree and attended Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I met Amber and Amber enlightened me that California also has oil and gas platforms. But unlike the Gulf that was actively reefing their structures, California hadn't reefed any of their oil platform structures. And we set out to answer that question as to why that was. Did you figure it out, Amber? Well, we spent our entire graduate work really looking at the feasibility of a rigs to reef program in California from an economic, social and ecological perspective. And what we found is that in California, there's some of the most productive ecosystems on the planet, more productive than our natural coral reefs. There are these fantastic ecosystems. And we realized, you know, there might be ecosystems like this on oil platforms around the world. And could we find opportunities to conserve and protect those ecosystems when it comes time to decommission? So when we graduated from Scripps, Emily and I co-founded Blue Latitudes, which is our marine environmental consulting firm. And we worked directly with both governments and offshore energy companies to assist them in looking at their offshore structures on a case by case basis, which ones would make viable reefing habitats and which ones should be completely removed. A lot of our work involves using remotely operated vehicles or ROVs to assess the platform habitat beneath the water. We take videos of the beams and cross beams, a scaffolding of this platform jacket to look and assess at the marine life that's been developing there since the moment those structures were installed. Much of our work has taken place in the Gulf of Mexico, but we also have project work in California, Malaysia, Thailand, Mauritania. We've worked around the world on repurposing these offshore oil and gas structures into artificial reefs. OK, so you mentioned it just there, and I want to come back to sort of rewind. I realize the title is kind of obvious, but rigs to reefs. Would you unpack what that means and what's the value proposition? Who gets what out of it? Yeah, absolutely. So rigs to reef is an alternative to complete platform removal at the end of end of production life. So and this isn't just for fixed standing structures. We've also worked on spar facilities and in the Superdeep Sea, working on subsea pipelines, plaits, man folds, things like that that you might find down in the Superdeep Sea. So this is an alternative to completely removing all of that infrastructure at the end of life, where a portion of that structure remains in the water column to continue to function as an artificial reef. And there are three big benefits. The first is the ecological benefits that you see from retaining that marine life and that marine habitat. Usually it has an important impact on fisheries stakeholders because you're sustaining important fisheries habitat. Another major win is for the industry because there's usually significant cost savings associated with leaving a portion of that infrastructure in place. And in some cases, the infrastructure is too large to be taken on shore to be dismantled or perhaps their safety concerns in removing it. So there can be a major cost savings associated with reefing. And then the last benefit is for the state. Usually, at least in the Gulf of Mexico and in states like California, there's a cost sharing of the cost savings. So the oil companies are saving a lot of money, but they also need to make a donation to the state. That money funds an endowment for marine preservation and conservation. So it will fund departments of fish and wildlife and other research initiatives that are doing local conservation. So it's really a win-win-win. Win for the environment, win for industry, and win for the state. I think that's great. I love the triple win. I have questions about the value of each of those. So you said it's a significant cost savings. If I saved personally a million dollars, that'd be a huge cost savings to me, but not so much for an oil company. What kind of proportion of cost savings, when this can be applied, what kind of proportion of cost savings are we talking about or what kind of scale? Well, it's quite significant. I mean, decommissioning costs can range significantly based on platform age, its location, its size. But if you were to use an average number, a hundred million dollars, well, if you were going to reef that structure, it would cost roughly half that amount. So only fifty million dollars. But that fifty million dollars, as Amber said, it gets split. So twenty five million back to the stakeholders within the oil company and then twenty five percent going back to the state. So we're talking big numbers here. And that's just an average structure. Yeah, I love it. A million here, a million there. Pretty soon we're talking about real money. But I love the fact that you guys get to go look at these, drive ROVs around and look at what amounts to coral reefs. I think I remember reading that a single platform structure can represent multiple acres of habitable land. So is this something that really is good for the environment, good for the wild world and for how long? Is it or is this something that is you're going to make a big splash and so to speak, but really not much of an impact? So it really depends on the platform. It's a it's a case by case basis. And this also kind of goes for your cost saving question, because like Emily mentioned, there can be significant cost savings. But that cost savings can really vary by where you're located, where you're decommissioning. So in an area like the Gulf of Mexico, where they're routinely installing and decommissioning platforms, there's a lot of infrastructure on shore for those operations. And so costs are down. But in places like California, we don't have the infrastructure on shore and we don't have the large barges and all the material that you would need to easily decommission a structure. So our decommissioning costs in California are much higher because we would have to bring in vessels through the Panama Canal up into the Port of Long Beach to assist in some sort of decommissioning. So that can be a big range in the decommissioning costs and the savings associated with reefing. And the same goes for the ecosystems. In some areas, you might find thriving reefs that are associated with the platforms. But it really depends on where those structures are. Depends on a couple of factors. But where are they located? What type of complexity is associated with the structure? So a more complex structure is going to have a richer environment because you have more nooks and crannies. There's more real estate for the marine life to develop on. The placement of the structure, like I mentioned, is important. So if you have a structure place at the mouth of the Mississippi River, it's not going to be as successful as a platform that's out in a blue water environment because that platform is getting all the sedimentation and runoff from the Mississippi River, which might be impacting the marine life and habitat on the structure. And the last component for assessing a successful reef would really be age. How long has it been in the water column? Once that structure was initially installed, it pioneering small species begin to associate with the platform. And then over time, these larger, more robust ecosystems form. And over a set period of time, like 20, 30 years, you might have a thriving ecosystems with apex predators like sharks and things like that that are associated with the platform. And so those are some of the components that might make for a thriving reef. Man, that's great. And I love the fact you say it depends. And most things, most answers, it's true. It depends. But how how much are we speculating? How long have we been doing rakes to reefs? And based on what we've learned there, how long can we expect this ecosystem that we hope to create to continue to exist? Well, the best I guess that we have is to look to shipwrecks. And even that's not a very good example because ships are made from material that aren't made to be on the ocean bottom for a long period of time. They're made out of very different components versus an oil platform, which is made out of galvanized steel, typically. So we would guesstimate that if a platform was to be reefed, that we would see about 500 to 600 years before we see any sort of breakdown of the structure. The Ricks to Reefs program has been around since the late 1980s. And since that time, well over 500 platform structures have been reefed. And since that time, we've not noted any impacts from any sort of hurricanes damaging the structures. But again, this program is fairly new. It's only about 30 years old. So we don't really have a good estimate as to how long these structures could last in the water column. But we do know they're made out of materials that are made to be in the water column for a long period of time. And it's a great point. And I love the fact that this solution has been around for 30 years. We have some track record. And I love the idea that it'll last that long. And I grew up fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. And I used to consider myself a conservationist. But at this point, I think it's not enough to try to conserve and prevent from destruction. I think what we really need to do is try to make the world thrive. I'm a Thrivist now, a Thrivant. But the fact that this could last for hundreds of years is really, really impactful for the sports fishermen decades from now. Can catch a nice grouper and Lord willing let it go. So I used it before. It kind of depends. But you can't do it everywhere. But it sounds like you've done it all over the world. And one of the one of the folks on LinkedIn was asking how suitable, generally speaking, would a subtropical environment be and what kind of water depths would be optimal now, realizing it's not going to work everywhere. Some places it would. What about subtropical? What kind of water depths would work? Well, you know, in a subtropical zone, we're going to see a lot of thriving coral species, a lot of warm water species that like those upper photic zones. So those are the zones closest to the surface. But Amber and I would argue that the all zones of an oil platform are valuable. We've seen really unique marine life down hundreds, even thousands of feet down. It's just a different environment. So at the surface, it's much more technical or you see a lot more abundance. So that means number of individuals. But in the deeper zones, we may see less abundance, so fewer numbers of individuals, but we actually see higher biodiversity. So that means more species, less individuals. So really, all of the zones are very important to the ecosystem. But an oil platform in a subtropical zone will start to attract and initially produce marine life right away. So we have a good example of this in California. And although that's not subtropical, the platforms in California routinely get cleaned down to about 60 feet. And so we have this running experiment really where we can see how quickly marine life can grow and colonize on the structure every couple of years. So we do know that this happens very, very quickly. And so what you're looking for is beyond that attraction versus production question. So we want to be producing marine life. So fish are spawning on the oil platform rather than just being temporarily attracted to the structure. And that production takes a little bit longer to occur. But again, this is a very fast process. You can get a very thriving, healthy ecosystem within five years. Bang. And now the fact that you have environments from the top to the bottom, I suppose also means that a number of locations and a number of designs are suitable. Is that a good assumption? Yes, absolutely. So as Amber mentioned, we've seen these ecosystems on spar structures, on deep sea templates. We've seen them on pipelines. We've seen them on multi-leg structures. But what we do find is that we find the most robust, healthy ecosystems on more complex structures. So with lots of beams and cross beams as opposed to a monopile structure or very simplistic structure, marine life will always be attracted to very complex structure. This makes sense. You know, imagine if you're a hunter, you're not going to go find a lot of wildlife in a big open area where there's no place for them to hide. So a structure that's very complex provides a lot of refuge and habitat for a variety of species. So those platforms that are very deep, those platforms that have a lot of complex structure, those tend to make for the best ecosystems. Well, it seems like what you're talking about is a complete ecosystem, right? From crustaceans to minnows and all kinds of things all the way up to large fish. Is that right? Yes, yeah, absolutely. You see anything from small invertebrates, scallops and enemies, different corals to some of the larger fish species that could include anything from a recreational commercially valuable fish to some of the larger, you know, top of the food train fish like sharks and things like that that are associated with the structure. All right. So I love I'm here in Tulsa, which is where the Garth Brooks got his start. And I love one of his old songs. It says it was bound to happen. And one day it did. Papa came home and it was just us kids. Now, for those of you who may not be able to listen to the song, I apologize, but I'm not going to sing it. And one day our our platforms are going to need decommissioning. It's bound to happen. And one day it will. So is this is Reeks to Reef something we can we need to plan for? Or is it something we can just kind of do on a whim at the end of the day, as if any multiple million dollar project could be done at the whim at the end of the day? Yeah, plant planning with the end in mind is a critical component to successfully reefing a structure, because the more data that you've collected over the lifespan, the life span of the structure, the more information, the better case you have that it's going to be a thriving reef and an important part of the localized habitat. So one way you could do that is to just take a look at some of the maybe maintenance footage that you've been collecting on the structure. So using ROV video footage of the platform that maybe was collected to ensure the integrity of the structure. But from that footage, you may begin to assess a baseline of what's what life is associated with that structure. So a lot of the work that we do, sometimes we start there. We want to establish a baseline and then do several years of ROV based marine life surveys on the structure to build a case that there is an important habitat associated with the platform. And all of this goes into reporting and permitting compliance for reefing. Yeah, great. I appreciate that. You know, my work on shore and with some sample cash flows from offshore shows that the costs of decommissioning can commonly take 10, even 10 to 15 years of cash flow, the last 10 to 15 years of cash flow can equal total cost. And so I'm telling people on shore is it's never too early. When you if you buy it, you've got a plan on burying it. We have some other questions coming in from online and some interesting questions I hadn't thought of. Is there any destruction to the habitat temporarily in the process of reefing? Or is it just continuous growth upwards or is there a dip of harm in the process? That's a good question. And it really does depend on the type of reefing that we do. But for example, there's, there's, you know, four different ways really that you can reef a structure, you could tow it to an alternative location. In those situations, we've actually had studies and we've seen video where the fish actually follow the platform as it was being dragged to another location. So we know their site fidelity from a lot of these fish species, even if their home does get temporarily moved. So where we see the greatest impact is on the site. And then we see that on a lot of more of the sessile species, the corals, those species that are attached physically to the platform. If a platform is toppled onto its side as a reef, if the upper portion is removed and placed on the seafloor bottom, that's where we're going to see more impact to those species that are directly attached to the structure. But again, with fish, they're much more mobile and they're able to move or adapt to the platform's new location. And if you do topple a structure onto its side, if you do remove the upper portion and place it onto the seafloor bottom, there will be a temporary, a temporary lapse in how much marine life is on the structure. But over time, as I mentioned earlier, it comes back quite quickly and you might see different species, species that colonize in those deeper depth zones. And as I mentioned before, those depth zones are important. In California, we see a lot more of the breeding species happen to occur at the base of the platform structure. We're not finding fish breeding at the top, they're breeding at the bottom. So really all different zones are very important. And even though there might be a temporary impact, it's temporary. Okay, that's great. So what about the oil company on an ongoing basis? It saved money initially, but this is another question from LinkedIn. They're saving money initially, but what kind of long term liability do they have? Are they trading a temporary cost savings for a larger long term liability? Liability is a really important question. And in areas like the Gulf of Mexico, the liability is transferred to the state and the state manages the liability of that platform as a reef in perpetuity. So they are managing any sort of maintenance costs and the liability is no longer on the operator. Although they'll always be responsible for the liability of the well itself when it comes to that platform jacket, they've transferred it to the state. And that's a part of their agreement through permitting it as a reef as well as a part of their donation agreement. So when they give a portion of the cost savings to the state into that endowment for marine preservation, they're funding that sort of long term maintenance that the state is taking on in that liability. Now that's the case in the Gulf of Mexico, but in places like California, the liability within our rigs to reef law is not not as clear. It's not so black and white and it doesn't necessarily necessarily designate the liability that the liability would be transferred to the state. And so that creates an issue because the oil companies are not necessarily interested in reefing if they have to maintain that liability in perpetuity. Like you mentioned, that's going to be a big risk for them. There could be potential costs or other issues that would come up with retaining that liability. So that creates a big issue and we've seen the most success when there's been a transfer of liability to the state because the state manages other artificial reefs offshore. It's kind of a it's a part of what they do through their artificial reefing programs. So if these structures are being incorporated into those programs, it would make sense that the state would take on that liability. Well, you mentioned that there have been some projects in other parts of the world. Southeast Asia, for example, has a number of offshore platforms. It sounds like maybe those places would benefit from creating some of the same legal arrangements, protections that exist on the Gulf of Mexico. Is that about right? Yeah, I definitely think so. In Southeast Asia, it's a little bit of a different story because there many of the oil companies are state owned. And so it's a there's not like a transfer of liability because they're owned by the state. So the state retains that liability anyway. So it's a that in Southeast Asia can be a little bit of a different of a different story. There are offshore platforms in a lot of places in Africa, too. It seems like it is an extensible solution. But what about repurposing? One of the questions on online came about is there an alternative or maybe a complementary repurposing of the platforms that's also available? Yeah, absolutely. We've definitely examined that opportunity. It's, you know, again, it really depends on the platform structure. So in California, we have some of the oldest, some of the largest platform structures. So retrofitting one to be used for an alternative use while not an impossibility is much more expensive as opposed to a structure that's perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico that's much newer, that doesn't need as much of that retrofitting. It's not from the 60s or 70s. These are the old platforms. You know, there's not asbestos in the walls of the structure. So you really want to think about the type of structure that you're looking at. But where we have seen this opportunity examined is with offshore aquaculture as well as offshore energy storage, as well as offshore wind power. There's actually a jackup rig in Southeast Asia that's been converted into an ecotourism resort. Amber and I actually stayed there on a research expedition. It's a very unique experience. I'm so jealous. Yeah, it was fantastic. So, you know, I think we have examined that question. And we've also heard about folks looking into turning these structures into research stations, which we think is brilliant, because, you know, there's very few people that get access to a marine lab that far offshore. So the data that you collect is quite valuable. It all comes down to cost. Maintaining an offshore structure is expensive. And so that's the biggest factor there. And that's the key. The only reason where people have been turned away is either the platform age or the cost of maintaining the structure in the water column. What a fascinating set of questions and dilemmas. And it's something that has worldwide application, not universal, but broad application and something that has a very long benefit, something that we know enough about to plan for, it seems like. And I was asking online, do we have the opportunity to plan for this from the beginning? Do we have the opportunity to plan rigs from the beginning to be better reefs? Do we have the opportunity to plan offshore windmills or other offshore structures from the beginning to be better habitat when we're done? Yeah, absolutely. I think we can look at the offshore oil and gas industry and take some lessons learned when we're moving forward into new energy development offshore, such as offshore wind, developing those structures smarter. So making those structures more complex so that they can function not only as energy generation turbines, but also as potential marine habitats for the ecosystems that are in that localized area. So that's definitely an opportunity. And we've been in a lot of discussions on the East Coast where they're really initiating and doing a lot of offshore wind development to look at the oil and gas industry and start to think about these structures as more than just wind turbines. But how can we develop and place them in areas that would maximize their positive impact they could have on the marine environment and potentially mitigate some decommissioning risks with that eventual end of life that all structures are going to have offshore? So I'm sure I thank you for that. I am sure that you guys could talk at length much longer than the time we have about the details of all this. I understand that you guys are happy to answer questions if somebody had others, but for now we're out of time. Let me tell you, thank you on behalf of the SPE and also thank you personally as a conservationist, fishermen, thriveist for the work you're doing. Appreciate you being here today and I look forward to seeing your work in the Gulf of Mexico and other places. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks for listening to the SPE live podcast.

How Current Technology Can Help Us Through This Downturn with Duncan Blue,"This is Glenda Smith, SPE's Vice President of Communications, and today we're talking with Adam Siminski. Thank you for joining me today, Adam. Great to be here with you, Glenda, and it's a pleasure to work with you and all the people at SPE. Thank you. We reconnected during the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Saudi Arabia in January, but we first met back in the mid-1980s around the time of the 1986 oil price shock. A lot of people are saying that this one is even worse than what the industry experienced then. Do you agree? Well, we had a couple of things going on at the same time. I think in looking back in history, we've had supply shocks and we've had demand shocks, but we never had a simultaneous supply and demand shock. There was a OPEC meeting in early March that didn't go very well, and the outcome of that was a number of OPEC members who had been holding spare capacity, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, and others, increased their production. A lot of people thought that that is what ultimately drove oil prices down into the teens and even temporarily below $10 a barrel for WTI. But what really makes this particular crisis different than the ones in the past is the huge demand shock that's come from the social distancing rules associated with trying to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The amount of oil that OPEC and OPEC Plus members were holding off the market was something like three million barrels a day, and that amount looked like it was coming into the market in April. People were talking about a price war within OPEC, but that only lasted literally about one week after the early March OPEC meeting in Vienna. What happened in mid-March was everybody at that point began to realize the extent of the problem with social distancing rules. Airlines not flying, people not driving, millions and millions of people all over the world working remotely, a lot of people at home and told by the authorities to stay at home, businesses closed. The result of that was in early March, people had thought that maybe demand in April might be down three, four, five million barrels a day. By the end of March, those estimates for what was going to happen in April were 15 million barrels a day, 20, 25, even 30 million barrels a day of demand destruction. So I kind of look at what was happening, and I think that that level of drop in demand that we have already worked our way through part of that in April, and we're still seeing the effects of that in May, and it'll continue for a while, is larger than anything that the world has seen since the beginning of the oil industry, literally. Absolutely. Our CEO, Mark Rubin, has said the only analog he can find is back to the 1920s when the East Texas Scandal broke out. He said, 20s when the East Texas field was discovered and the market was flooded, which eventually led to the state of Texas to putting in production quotas, etc. But you have to go back that far to find any kind of simultaneous fly-in-demand sort of shock. Right. And the East Texas field discovery was a huge supply shock that then actually played out into the depression in the 1930s. So again, you had a little combination. But I think this was the rapidity, the speed of the demand destruction that occurred with the coronavirus, I think even exceeded what we saw during the 1930s. Yeah, I think that was the double whammy, the speed with which it happened. I know I've used, I think, a little over a quarter of a tank of gas in my car since early March. So multiply me by the millions of people around the world and you start to see, and of course, airplanes not flying internationally, that's a huge amount of fuel. Right. So one of the interesting questions, Glenda, is going to be, you know, when we come out of the social distancing rules as they're eased, I think people are going to want to get back in their cars. They're going to be more comfortable in cars than they might be in mass transportation buses, trains, subways, and so on. And we might actually see a surge in gasoline consumption. Diesel fuel consumption has already, the last few weeks, is picking up a little bit in the United States relative to where it was before. So we're seeing things beginning to come back. But it will be kind of an interesting tug of war between people getting in their cars to drive to work or using virtual platforms like Zoom and Skype and WebEx and all of the others to get a lot of business done, working remotely, and maybe not even needing as much airline traffic. You know, again, I think airlines, you know, will come back too, and people will travel again. But I think that that might take a little bit longer to, you know, maybe we're really going to need a vaccine before people are going to be willing to get on an airplane, or they're going to have to really rely on the airlines and the central governments around the world, making sure that the air filtration systems on airplanes are going to take care of the issue of airborne particles. I think it's clear that the world is going to change. We just don't fully understand the ways in which that's going to happen yet. Want more insights from today's conversation?

So back in the mid 80s, one of the things you and I had in common was the need for and the need to understand what was happening with energy data. And during the 86 downturn, it was really hard to understand what was happening because of the quality and, more importantly, the lag in collecting data. Then between 2012 and 2016, you served as administrator of the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, the organization that's responsible for collecting, modeling, and providing statistical data about our industry. Tell our listeners a little bit about that experience and whether you were able to improve those data lags. SP Well, I had the privilege of serving in President Obama right at the beginning of the second term and the last few months of the president's first term. The president, during his first campaign and even his first term in office, was largely interested in longer-term issues, how to transition the U.S. energy scene from hydrocarbon fuels to renewables, and that kind of thing. But at the end of 2011, the Libyan crisis occurred and a million and a half barrels a day of light-sweet crude oil went off to global markets and it caused oil prices to go up and it was a great concern to political leaders all over the world. Slot at EIA was vacant. Richard Newell, who's now the president of Resources for the Future in Washington, was headed back to Duke University. Howard Grinspeck was the deputy at EIA, was serving as acting administrator, and the president asked his people to find somebody who knew more about the oil markets and they asked me if I would be interested in serving as EIA administrator and being a big consumer of EIA products all through my Wall Street career, I really jumped at the chance to do that. I was retiring from my financial job and really thought the opportunity to work at EIA and shape EIA was going to be a fantastic experience. What I thought EIA needed was to be a little bit more timely and more relevant. The oil supply forecasts for EIA typically were based on data that was more than a year old, just as an example, and in the period when shale was really beginning to grow strongly in 2012, that just simply wasn't really ideal at all in terms of having fairly accurate forecasts for oil production in the United States and natural gas as well. So when I got to EIA, we began to look for ways to make near-term estimates of things that typically would have been backward looking, and we tried to look forward and tried to use the number of different statistical tools and data collection options, including things that were available from other federal agencies, data on how much oil was moving by rail, for example, that was available from the transportation department. And this was a little new for EIA to kind of step into a more timely collaborative approach to the process. I think it ultimately ended up making EIA a much more relevant and very strong data analysis and collection agency. It made the reports that were coming from EIA much more useful to policymakers in the United States and actually all over the world because of the quality and accuracy of the data. So it was a great platform to inherit and to build on. I think that we have seen some positive changes, especially the new Shale report that they launched. Well, it's not new anymore, but launched while you were there to try and get some better data. Do you feel like the better data we have today might help to reassure energy markets, which tend to respond to every rumor innuendo, take a change in the API stock report as, oh my gosh, the whole trend is going this way when we both know a statistical anomaly may cause a weekly shift. Do you feel like it's a little better these days? I think it is. There's always room for improvement. One of the sayings that is often used in management is if you can't measure it, you can't manage it. And if you're trying to manage something or understand it or use it in your analysis, you've got to be able to measure it and measure it. One of the things that EIA is looking at now, and I really hope they move on this, is to get more timely data on well shut-ins. That would really, I think, help deal with this rapid decline in production that's probably underway coming from very low prices and lack of capital investment in shale production that's happening right now. Generally speaking, statistical agencies, including EIA, tend to do things, again, very accurately looking back in time. And the challenge in a period like the one that we're in now, crisis times, is to get data that helps you understand where you are today and where you might be tomorrow, rather than giving you the best look at where you were last year. Back to the Libyan crisis in 2011, one of the things that we started at EIA after that, and it still has proven to be a very valuable contribution to energy analysis, is unplanned outages in oil production. The Libyan crisis was an unplanned outage. There was a big actual drop in oil production across the world in 2012 that was coming in little bits and pieces from a lot of different countries. Libya was one of them, but Iran was another. It was one of those deaths by a thousand cuts kind of thing. Oil production was faltering in a lot of different countries, and some of the amounts seem small, but when you added them all up, it was causing a fairly chaotic situation in the oil markets, pushing prices up and causing a lot of heartache for energy consumers around the world. And we figured out a way to track on a very timely basis, and EIA is still doing it. And those kinds of innovations, and they're still underway at EIA, are very important. I think that's a great legacy that you can look back on, because obviously anything that gives us better data allows us to plan and understand what's happening better than we would otherwise be able to.

So for the last two years, you've been president at King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, or CAPSARC, and it's an independent research institute designed to advance the understanding of energy and economy. So tell us a little bit about CAPSARC and what you're doing there. I have to admit, when I saw that, I was like, okay, so Adam's moved to managing a research institute. That's got to be a little bit of a shift. And yet, I see elements of similarity. CAPSARC is actually very similar to the EIA and parts of the IEA and other institutions who look at energy issues and try to do it from a fact-based perspective. We are a think tank. We have been rated fairly highly. We're among the top 15 think tanks for energy and resource issues, as well as Middle East, North Africa, general issues, as measured by the University of Pennsylvania Think Tank Survey, which is a peer-voted kind of ranking of how think tanks are doing. In addition to energy broadly and the economy, we also do quite a bit of work on environmental issues. And we can talk a little bit about that in a bit if you'd like to. But this kind of three major areas of energy, the economy, and the environment is something that's of critical importance to Saudi Arabia and to countries really all across the world. We are trying to provide fact-based analysis to help inform policymakers here in the kingdom of the consequences of the choices that they end up having to make in the energy area. Energy is a huge part of the Saudi economy. Depending on how you measure it, it's half of the Saudi economy. And so having a think tank type organization working closely with the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Economy, and so on is very important to Saudi Arabia's understanding of the issues that drive the energy market. So in a sense, CAPSARC is trying to do some of the same things that EIA was doing in the U.S. We don't have a data collection mandate in the same way that EIA does, but we have been putting together data that can be used by our own researchers and anybody else that's available freely on our website, capsarc.org. Data and analysis that we do have, and we've been trying to concentrate on data for not just Saudi Arabia, but other countries in the Gulf area, because it's not always easy to find, and it makes it a lot easier for researchers to put together their own papers. The other thing that CAPSARC is trying to do with me here now is a bit like the story that we were talking about at EIA. CAPSARC was founded on the idea of doing long-term academic studies and making sure that voices from the Gulf region were counted well in the peer-reviewed academic literature for energy and economics and the environment, but we are now trying to make sure that the reports that we're doing and even our longer-term academic studies have a relevancy for our local stakeholders to help them make decisions. Just as an example, we did a peer-reviewed paper a couple of years ago now on the value of OPEC's spare capacity to the global economy, and we published that paper, and essentially what it said was spare capacity reduces volatility, and that lower volatility actually has a positive net value for the global economy. It helps boost GDP for all across the world. A number of people tried to find holes in our argument, didn't find, I think not successfully. That paper has held up pretty well, and I think that it's been particularly important, and I think now people are actually going back and having another look at that in light of the collapse in oil prices. What happened with oil prices is really almost a failure of enough countries to use spare capacity and strategic reserve capacities to buy when prices are falling for reasons like the demand collapse from coronavirus, or sell into markets when there are political issues or rapid economic growth that are driving demand faster. So I'm having a lot of fun here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, doing many of the same things that I did when I was on Wall Street and when I was at the Energy Information Administration, or actually at the Center for Strategic and International Studies where I went after EIA. The combination of trying to use Wall Street techniques to improve data collection and analysis and bring think tank culture to approaches to policy analysis is something that has been really a privilege for me. The Saudis have always played an interesting role there in terms of being the swing producer, and I think the world economy became dependent on it, but perhaps didn't realize the benefits to themselves from that, so I think that was great. So one of the other things you mentioned was the environmental research that's happening at CAPSARC. Tell us a little more about that. I know there's some stuff about the circular economy and the energy transition. Well, the concept of the circular economy has been around for a long time, and a lot of work has been done on how to reduce, reuse, and recycle materials in the economy to get rid of the things that you don't want and enhance the things that you do want. We at CAPSARC have been looking at kind of an extension of that idea. We call it the circular carbon economy. What we said was, you know, the idea that the world is quickly going to move to all renewable energy is not an easy thing to do and may be very expensive and not even desirable. There are many countries in the developing world who still need concentrated sources of energy and relatively inexpensive energy. Could be relying on hydrocarbons for a long time to come. Now, we all know that climate change and global warming is real, and that's believed in Saudi Arabia as it is in many other countries. I think that the question that comes up, and certainly here in Saudi Arabia, is that if people are going to continue to use hydrocarbons, is there a way that we can figure out how to make that doable without jeopardizing either the economy or the environment? The idea of the circular carbon economy is to add a fourth R to the reduce, reuse, and recycle idea, and that's remove. We like to frame it in a concept that was developed by a guy by the name of Bill McDonough, who's an environmental architect, actually, who works out of the United States. Bill was one of the early proponents of the circular economy, and he's very intrigued by the idea of the circular carbon economy, and he thinks of carbon in three ways. There's living carbon, durable carbon, and fugitive carbon. So the durable carbon is things that can be things like plastics that last for a long time, and there are other examples of durable carbon that remain in our environment for a long time and are not harmful at all. Then you have living carbon, and living carbon is where our bodies are made up of a lot of carbon, for example, and we breathe out carbon dioxide. Living carbon is in trees and can think of a cycle there of how carbon is produced and recycled through the living part of the environment, sequestered in biological ways, and again, that is not a problem, and it actually can be part of the solution. The biggest problem that we have is fugitive carbon, and that's carbon that's going out into the atmosphere and isn't being captured and is building up in the atmosphere, causing what everybody refers to as the greenhouse problem and greenhouse gases. Our idea is that we can reduce how much of that fugitive carbon is going out. We can reuse some of it. For example, you can turn carbon dioxide into fertilizer and methanol, just as an example, or you can recycle it to, again, prevent it from getting into the atmosphere and being fugitive, but the remainder that is going into the atmosphere, and I love the word fugitive carbon because we can think of that as we want to capture that. We want to capture that fugitive carbon and do something with it, and we could either sequester it biologically as part of that living carbon cycle, or we could sequester it geologically, and certainly the Society of Petroleum Engineers knows all about that. Finding ways to geologically sequester carbon dioxide is something that petroleum engineers have been working on for a long time. They know how to do it. It's a little expensive, but with the right tools, the right research, the right technology, we may be able to bring the cost down enough on that to really make a lot of progress at reducing that fugitive carbon that's in the air. The combination of putting all of these tools to use, reduce, reuse, recycle, and remove, I think is a way to allow all of us across the world to use hydrocarbon resources in a way that continues to benefit people and the economy without really harming the environment. It's going to take a coordinated effort. It's going to take a lot of work on research and technology, and it may take some time to implement all of this, but it's hugely important. Petroleum engineering is going to play a critical role in getting this done. I agree. I think that we'll be hearing more, and I love to know more over time about the research that you guys are doing in that area, because I think it's a big part of how our industry is really part of the solution as much as part of the problem as many people view us, or many people view us as the problem, not even as part of the problem. But that's absolutely correct. I think what people are thinking, too many people, are thinking that carbon is the enemy and that oil and gas are the problem, yet they're critical for economic development, and we just need to find better ways to manage the externalities that come with it. And I know that there are a lot of papers being written by members of the Society of Petroleum Engineers on how to do this, and with proper funding of technology, I think that a lot of progress can be made. I think there is some progress being made, and I know we'll see more, and we'll look forward to hearing about the work you guys are doing. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

So I'd be remiss if I didn't come back to energy markets and where you think things are going over the next couple of years. Do you have any projections about how long you think it'll take supply and demand to come back into balance? You know, in my career in energy analysis, which started in the early 1970s, I've been through, I don't know, I think it depends on how you count them, at least five or six cycles. The 1970s were, you know, the 1960s energy prices were relatively flat, and most people were, you know, really thinking about other things in the 1960s, and we had the, you know, two huge price increases in the 1970s and really put energy on the map. The 1980s ended up being a period of price collapse. The 1990s were another flat period again, and I think we spent more time thinking about the internet in the 1990s than we did about the, you know, energy issues. The first decade of the new century, the 2000s, we had enormous economic growth in Asia in general, China specifically, and oil demand was growing really, really strongly again, and we had another upcycle in prices. That's when we got shale, gas and oil really started at the end of that decade, and it worked so well that we ended up with another price collapse in 2014 to be followed by the one that we've just had this year. I'm going to stop with that history lesson and just say this has been an incredibly volatile industry with periods where prices were rising rapidly and then falling rapidly, and I don't think that we have ended that kind of cyclical situation, which suggests to me, and in fact I'm very concerned that the result of the very low prices that we're seeing now will be another big upcycle sometime over the course of the next few years, you know, probably not this year and probably not in 2021, but it could certainly happen in 2022 or 2023, and I'm concerned that we'll have a lot of people, you know, sitting around saying, well, how did this happen? And the answer is you didn't read enough history. You didn't read enough history. Or study basic economics and the law of supply and demand. Well, right, and just to briefly circle back to the economics of supply and demand, you know, why is this industry so volatile? And the answer is economists would say very low elasticities of both supply and demand. It takes big price increases to move the needle very much on changing supply or changing demand, and, you know, people just don't rush out and buy a new, you know, fuel-efficient car if the gasoline prices go to $4, and, you know, in this particular cycle, one of the things that is really different is typically when gasoline goes down, you know, gasoline was selling for a dollar a gallon in some places, and you would think people would be out really driving around and then buying some SUVs, you know, that, well, new, we're not getting, people aren't driving. You mentioned, you know, earlier, Wenda, that you had only used a quarter of a tank or something in the last, you know, couple of months. People aren't getting the opportunity to take advantage of the low prices that we have, and it's, this is one of those things that's very strange about this particular cycle, and it's compounded by the typically low elasticities that we have in the oil and gas area for both supply and demand. So we'll see. You know, I hope we learn, I hope international institutions can figure out a way to ameliorate these cycles that we get in. There is a big effort underway by the G20 oil ministers to try to find measures to bring some stability back into the oil markets, you know, and they're not trying to push prices up in the sense is what they're trying to say is we can't really, nobody's, it's not in anybody's interest to have prices below replacement levels across the world, and that's something that both producing and consuming countries fully agree on. And maybe that's the bright spot of this, is that perhaps this time, perhaps our leaders have learned that low oil prices are not always good. Yeah, you know, and it's not, you know, I don't want to just blame the leaders or I don't want to say it's the politicians who don't get it. I mean, I think in some cases, it's just us. The enemy and the enemy is us. I think that people are, there has actually been statistical studies done on this. People get anchored, they call it statistical anchoring. You get, we perceive that events in the near term are much more important than things that have happened even in the near past. So that the situation that we find ourselves in now, people tend to believe it's going to stay forever, you know, and it won't. You know, we're going to find a vaccine, we're going to find social distancing rules that work, we're going to find technology for testing that will enable us to get people back to work and get the economy moving again globally. And right now, I think people are just really concerned that the situation we're in isn't going to change, but it will. And my feeling is that it will also change in energy. And we are going to see, you know, we already know that non-hydrocarbon energy is becoming increasingly important and will be a huge contributor to the effort to fix the climate problems that we've gotten ourselves into. But it's not the only solution, it won't be the only solution for every country. There are still going to be places where oil and natural gas are going to be very, very important to economic growth and societal development. That's going to be true in Asia, in Latin America, in the Middle East, and in Africa, in Africa. So the solutions that work in the United States and work in Europe aren't going to be perfect everywhere. But coming back to the circular carbon economy idea, I think we can find ways to deal with the environmental consequences of hydrocarbon use in ways that allow us to to continue to provide for economic well-being, access to energy for for many more people than have it today. Let me just finish up by saying, Glenda, that CAPSARC is working with the International Energy Agency, with the OECD, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the Nuclear Energy Agency, as well as the Global Carbon Capture and Sequestration Institute on a guide to what the circular carbon economy is all about. We'll have that published by the early fall of this year, and I think it's going to be a kind of one of those fact-based kinds of reports that will help policymakers around the world understand the issues that they're facing with energy and the environment and the economy. And we can all make the decisions that need to be made on the basis of facts rather than hearsay. I think that sounds wonderful. I look forward to seeing that report when it's available. Adam, thank you for joining me today. I hope our listeners find your comments of interest, and we'll learn more about the work that's happening at CAPSARC. Well, thank you for the opportunity to chat with you, and I look forward to seeing you at more energy meetings around the world, and particularly Society of Petroleum Engineering meetings. Great. Thank you so much. We're looking forward to getting back to face-to-face meetings."
Reducing Methane Emissions in the O&G Value Chain,"You're listening to the SPE Podcast. I'm Paige McCowan, and we're talking about the SPE Virtual Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference, also known as LACPEC. And we're talking today with... Roberto F. Aguilera. And Roberto Aguilera. Welcome, everyone. Welcome, everyone. We have, I think, a first for SPE Podcasts for sure, a father and son duo today talking about LACPEC, which starts July 27th. You can still register for the conference on SPE Events page at spe.org slash events. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us today. Tell us a little bit about yourselves and have you collaborated on technical papers in the past? Thank you, Paige. Yes, we've collaborated in about 20 papers, starting back in 2006 when I graduated from the Colorado School of Mines, getting my PhD in mineral and energy economics. Most of our joint work deals with petroleum markets and prices. And we also do research on the energy mix. That is the combination of different energy sources that are expected to satisfy total energy demand in the coming decades. And I also thank you, Paige. This has been certainly very rewarding, mixing the economic aspects of the oil and gas industry, that has been done by my son, Roberto F. And mixing that with the technical aspects of petroleum engineering, which is my area of specialization. That's great, especially talking about the energy demand and the mix. That's something that's a hot topic these days throughout the industry. Well, tell us a little bit more about your backgrounds. Well, I'm from Canada, and I've been working, though, in Perth, Australia at Curtin University for the past eight months, though I also worked here from 2010 to 2013. Over the past couple of years, in 2018-19, I was on the SPE Distinguished Lecture Program, which took me around the world, and that was presenting on the subject of oil prices. And it became very interesting, especially in the Q&A discussions, to hear about the commonalities in terms of what people think are the main issues facing the petroleum markets and the industry. Before that, in 2013-17, I was an analyst at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, in Vienna, where I was with their research division, which produces oil and energy forecasts and then publishes those findings in reports and outlooks. And those are freely available to the public on their website. Another highlight of mine is a book where I was the co-author called The Price of Oil, published by Cambridge University Press back in 2015. That book basically examines the past, the present, and the future of the oil market. And Roberto? Yes, I was born in Colombia, South America. Hence, my deep interest in OPEC. I got my bachelor's degree at the University of America, Universidad de America in Bogotá, worked for a while in Colombia, and then came to the U.S. to do my master and Ph.D. in petroleum engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. I was a distinguished lecturer for SP in the year 2000-2001, discussing naturally fractured reservoirs. And I was very pleased to be editor-in-chief of a new monograph published by the SP that deals with unconventional reservoirs. I also authored in the past a book entitled Naturally Fractured Reservoirs. Wow, that's great. We've got some heavy hitters here on the show today talking about... So let's talk about LACPEC. So it's an important event in the industry for more than 25 years now. Can you tell us a little bit about the conference and why it's so important? Well, myself, I've been to two past LACPEC events. One of those was in Peru, the other one in Argentina. I see these as very important events because they bring together the community in the region to advance the industry, despite the challenges it faces, ranging from technical to policy to environmental and commercial challenges. I think it is great to bring together the Caribbean and Latin American oil and gas industry expertise. All of our countries have so much to offer on the practical, academic, theoretical aspects of petroleum engineering. We have been very fortunate that in addition we have had for many years the participation in LACPEC of the United States and Canada, as well as some countries from Europe, Asia and Oceania. So this is a very important international conference. It is. What can you expect to take away or what can others expect to take away from the event? It's virtual this year, so it's a little different. Yeah, for me, it's an opportunity to expand my knowledge in areas somewhat outside of my specialty of energy economics and, of course, to expand my network with the very accomplished and friendly SBE community in the region. Well, I am particularly interested in issues related to unconventional reservoirs. I can hardly wait to listen to those presentations and to read the corresponding papers on the Vaca Muerta shales in Argentina, as their findings could have some application in other Latin American shales not yet developed, such as La Luna in Colombia and Venezuela and the for shale in Mexico. One of the great things about the SBE conferences, including LACPEC, is that a complete manuscript is required in order to get to the podium to make the presentation. And all of these manuscripts then remain in OnePetro, making them available to all petroleum engineers around the world. Yes, OnePetro is a great resource. And for those who are unaware, it's OnePetro.org. And you can find papers not only from SBE, but other industry associations as well. Much of the work of the Society of Petroleum Engineers is accomplished by members. Become a volunteer and use your knowledge and experience to influence SBE programs and activities. As a volunteer, you can enhance your leadership skills while meeting and working with other SBE members from across the globe. There are many opportunities to get involved, regardless of your experience, location, or experience level. To learn more about the League of Volunteers, visit spe.org. volunteer. So tell us a little bit about the session that your paper will be presented in. Yeah, our our joint paper is in a session dealing with case studies of petroleum business development. So it's a very practical and applied session. For instance, there's a presentation in that session called Early Engagement Collaboration to Evaluate Business Opportunities in Crude Trading Industry. That's of particular importance to me considering my economics and finance background and the fact that things like investor demand, hedging, and speculation continue to become increasingly important in the industry, including in Latin America. And Roberto, what about you? I'm very keen on listening to analog field studies of reservoirs in Mexico and Brazil. This should be super for LafTech participants as correct use of analogs is always very important in the oil and gas industry. The other current topic that is of significant interest in our industry has to do with machine learning. I love the title of that paper in our session that mixes machine learning with reservoir physics. This in my view is critical. Not paying attention to the reservoir physics can easily lead to major technical fears, costs, and significant financial losses. Wow, that sounds interesting as well. Do you guys know how the virtual event will happen? Do you do your presentations and will there be an opportunity for Q&A? Yes, we will be pre-recording presentations along with PowerPoint and submit those to the organizers ahead of time. And those will be played at the actual LACPEC event and then the authors will be available after those recordings are played for live Q&A sessions. Good, although it's virtual, it keeps you engaged to be able to take questions from people. That's awesome. Yes, this is all new for everybody. Yeah, definitely. But hopefully it'll work well. So let's talk about your paper. Your paper is a very timely topic for the industry, how the price of oil affects oil production. And specifically it talks about unconventional reservoirs. Can you tell us a little bit about how this paper came about? Sure. We've been studying the petroleum market since the early 2000s when prices started rising due to extremely strong economic growth, particularly in emerging economies and the rapid increase of petroleum consumption that came with that. At the time, you'll recall there were widespread fears of oil production shortages. Then at LACPEC 2014 in Maracaibo, Venezuela, when oil prices had averaged about $100 a barrel for several years, we presented an original paper and a methodology to investigate the price of oil. We stated in that paper that, quote, with the vast global oil resource base and significant technological advances being implemented by the industry, oil prices could decrease in the future, end quote. Prices did start to decline significantly in late 2014. And you could say the world has been experiencing an environment of relatively low prices since then. Given that good comparison between our 2014 LACPEC study and the actual oil pricing during the last six years, we use the same methodology in this year's LACPEC paper for investigating possible ranges of oil prices in the future. I would just add that oil production from shales is extremely important, but the recoveries to be very low, ranging between about 5 and 10 percent. That's low, but our research at the University of Calgary shows that these recoveries can be increased significantly by HOF and POF gas injection. So we decided to integrate this aspect in our oil price manuscript. So without giving too much away, what were your results? Our results stem from a successful matching of the small and large variations of historical oil prices since the year 1861 using a model we call the Variable Shape Distribution, VSD model. We also successfully match oil consumption rates from 1861 to 2019 using a global energy market model, the GEM model. The combination of the two models and our investigation on availability of oil resources leads to the conclusion that our statement at LACPEC 2014 in Maracaibo remains current. That is, oil resources are abundant, technology keeps advancing, particularly for unconventional shale oil, and all of this has resulted in fairly low price levels. Our methodology further indicates that, barring an unforeseen global disruptive event, oil prices should remain suppressed for the foreseeable future. This supports the findings of the book I mentioned earlier from 2015 that forecasts oil prices between $40 and $60 per barrel by 2035 because prices are unlikely to prevail above the total production costs for the new supplies, which are estimated at $40 to $60 over the long run. These findings contrast with the work of authoritative energy forecasting agencies who project rising prices in the coming decades. Of course, price spikes are possible and so are price crashes, as we saw earlier this year when oil demand was devastated by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a short-lived price war by major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia added further downward pressure to the price. Despite this, forecasting organizations are already predicting sharply rising prices in the years ahead due to a global economic recovery and envisaged oil supply shortages because of lack of capital investment. But again, our research suggests a low price trend on account of abundant reserves, improved technology, and declining production costs. Roberto, anything to add to that? No, I think that's excellent and very complete. I have nothing to add on that one. Are you considering becoming an SPE member?

So you talked a little bit about what you feel like the results indicate for the future of oil and demand, but is there anything that we can look for in that model? Yes, our global energy market gem model has been used since 2007 to forecast oil consumption. It provided accurate results when compared with the most recent statistics of oil demand or oil usage. The topic of peak oil demand has received much attention in recent years. There are many opposing views on when oil demand will reach a maximum. Even some oil companies, particularly some of the European organizations, see the peak coming soon enough. For example, the mid 2020s, and they even talk about it publicly sometimes and have made some adjustments to their investment portfolios to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Our LACPEC paper, however, indicates that it's unlikely that oil demand will peak in the coming decades, mostly because there is no large scale substitute for oil in its major end use of transportation. The petrochemical sector is also expected to be an important source of growth in the coming decades. Well, I would like to talk a little bit about the uniqueness of our forecasting methods for the oil price and global oil consumption. Those methods and projections have remained unchanged since their creation and publication in an SP paper in 2007. And yet they continue to generate reasonable results. This is in contrast with methods of other organizations and commentators that change their forecasts repeatedly. So speaking of volatility, can you give us your insights on the recent turmoil in the industry and how it may affect us in the future? Yeah, for example, a somewhat recent event that caused market disorder was the attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in September 2019, which disrupted oil production capacity of the kingdom by about five million barrels per day. That volume is important as it represents about half their daily production and close to 5% of the global supply of oil per day. So this resulted in an oil price increase of about five to six dollars per barrel to a level of around 60 dollars. Had this happened a decade ago, the jump in the oil price would have been much more significant. Still following the attack, we saw some news media articles asking the question, will oil reach 100 dollars? The fact that the increase was only in the order of five to six dollars and that just a few days later, the price was back down to about 55 dollars per barrel speaks to the fact that the global endowment of oil, enhanced by the capability to produce oil from tight and shale petroleum reservoirs, has significantly removed the upward pressure on oil prices. The most recent dramatic event obviously has to do with the effects of the COVID pandemic. This brought the world to a standstill and combined with the major producers raising their production levels in the price war, it resulted in a negative WTI oil price in April 2020. Many commentators have therefore been predicting the end of the petroleum industry. Contrary to these views, our research indicates that the industry, with a significant shale oil and gas component, will contribute to global progress for many decades. This in spite of major problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent oil price war, both of which had clearly devastating but probably temporary impacts on the industry and on global petroleum consumption. Wow, yeah, it's really been a roller coaster lately, especially like you said with the COVID-19. I wanted to throw one other question in here for you. In the beginning, you talked about your study and your work done with the energy mix. Can you give us a little bit of your insight on how that will look for the future, the energy mix? Well, we basically see a very rapid penetration of natural gas into the future energy market. We have a forecast that goes out to 2035, also 2040, and we even extend that further into the future. But basically, already in the 2030s, we see natural gas having the highest market share out of any of the energy sources. That's based on the many advantages of natural gas, like its abundance, its affordability, its wide geographical distribution, and its environmental benefits compared with the other fossil fuels. When burned, natural gas emits fewer emissions than coal and oil. In addition, the unconventional gas revolutions we've spoken of have resulted in low gas prices. We also believe that we're in for low long-term gas prices, as is apparent from the experience in North America over the past decade, where the shale gas revolution reduced prices. That led to a decommissioning of coal-fired power facilities and the replacement by plants run on natural gas. By the way, that has reduced CO2 emissions in the U.S. to levels not seen since the 1990s. Really amazing. We think similar emissions reductions could be expected in other parts of the world, like Asia, for example, as cheaper and cleaner gas replaces coal in electricity generation. Yeah, that's very interesting. It's definitely a hot topic. Zero emissions, as some companies are working for, and like you said, the mix. Well, thank you, gentlemen. I really appreciate it.

Strengthening the SPE Conference Experience with Shauna Noonan,"Welcome to the SPE Podcast powered by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. You're listening to SPE Live, Causal Inferencing for Subsurface Engineering Applications. The audio from this episode was previously recorded on May 31, 2023. And now your moderator, Ray Liu. Welcome to this SPE Live on Causal Inferencing for Subsurface Engineering Applications. My name is Ray Liu and I'm a PhD candidate in the Howard Wentz Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University. I will be your moderator today. Today's SPE Live will last 30 minutes. We encourage you to ask questions during the program. Now it's my pleasure to introduce our guest, Dr. Zaden Schmitro. He is an Associate Professor at Texas A&M University. He is a researcher and educator in the field of subsurface monitoring and focusing for the exploration and production of subsurface engineering earth resources. In 2018, he received the U.S. Department of Energy Earlier Career Award. And in 2020, he was honored with four international awards for his contributions to exploration to physics and petroleum engineering. Dr. Schmitro holds a Bachelor of Technology degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and a PhD degree in petroleum and geosystems engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Schmitro, welcome to this SPE Live. Thank you, Ray, for this nice introduction. And one of the reasons I'm excited about today's discussion is you are joining. And you're the person who has explored this world of causal inferencing with me. So I'm so happy that I can share the stage with you and share our experiences and knowledge on this topic with the wider SPE community. Yeah, thank you for your time. We really appreciate the efforts you have put into sharing this knowledge. So I'll start to ask a few questions regarding to this topic. Again, focus on causal inferencing for subsurface engineering applications. We'll start from the basic one. What is the fundamental objective of causal inference and why is it important in various fields of studies? Great. So that's a great starting question. Causal inference is a statistical method that quantifies causal effect between a treatment and an outcome. So these are the two things that we are trying to relate. There's a directionality from treatment to outcome. We want to quantify the causal effect. And to do this, we have to control something called as confounders. So these confounders are parameters or variables that influence both the treatment and the outcome. If we can control the confounder, then we can quantify the causal effect properly. Now, causal inference is very popular in social sciences and economics. It helps design new policies, new strategies that can help human lives, that can improve environment. Let me give you an example of treatment, outcome and confounder from a petroleum engineering perspective. So let's say you want to introduce a new drilling fluid. So that will be a treatment, a new drilling fluid. The outcome that you're looking for is the quality or the improvement in the rate of penetration. So that is the outcome. And the confounding effects will be the rock type you're drilling through, the depth at which you're drilling, the pressure, the temperature conditions at which you drill, the drilling experience of the driller. So all those are confounding effects. If you take these confounding effects into control, then we can quantify the relationship of this new drilling fluid with the rate of penetration. Now, let me give you another example of where we can use causal inference. These are just examples and we can use it in a lot of different places. The other example is that you want to use a new simulation software. It's a numerical simulator that you want to use. So that is a treatment. And the outcome is the quality of forecasting, the accuracy of forecasting. And in this, the confounding effect will be the size of your team, the budget available, the data that is available to you, the quality of data that is available for simulation. So for this new treatment, which is a new simulator, the outcome is the accuracy of the simulator. These are some examples of treatment outcome and confounders. Now, when should we use causal inference? Anytime we want to introduce a modification or intervention to an existing process, that's where we should use causal inference. Anytime we want to understand the impact of a new technology, new strategy or a new design, causal inference will help you. If you want to understand a complex system where there are a lot of multiple interacting variables, that's where causal inferencing will help us better understand the underlying mechanism. When not to use causal inference, when the data is limited, because all this causal inferencing requires a lot of data to process. Causal inferencing is not good if you're doing exploratory data analysis, when you're exploring the data, all we care about are correlations. Causal inferencing is not good when we want to understand a very complex system. When a system becomes too complex, then causal inferencing might not help you understand the true cause and effect. And the final thing, which is very important to keep in mind is if there are too many confounders, if there are some confounders that cannot be measured, if there are some confounders that are unknown, then this entire world of causal inferencing will be weak. So Ray, from your experience, what do you think? How is the community using causal inferencing? Yeah, first I want to say I totally agree with your opinions. Cause and effect relationship help people to gain a better understanding of the different phenomena. And for our research, we could use causal inference to relate the crack propagation to the elastic waveform change. Captured by the wave transmission measurements around the material. And also our most recent research shows causal inference could also provide the essential insights for the policy making and also decision making regarding to subsurface injection activities and their impact on specificity. So it's really very helpful. Following that, you have mentioned the correlation stuff. So I'm wondering how does the causal inferencing differ from association or the correlation analysis? OK, so let me give you a very popular example of a correlation that a lot of us are aware of. Increase in the sales of ice cream and the increase in death due to drowning. Right, so there is a correlation between them. The ice cream sales increase, the death due to drowning increases. There is no causation there, but there's a very strong correlation. Why is that? Because there's a confounding variable, which is the temperature. As the temperature increases, both the ice cream sales and the drowning deaths, because a lot of people want to experience water. They want to go and swim. So it's a correlation. And this example clearly tells us why we as engineers, scientists, researchers need to truly understand causation. Correlation can be misleading. All of us are so excited about machine learning. We are using machine learning in a lot of different data driven modeling tasks. Now, how do these machine learning methods work? They try to find patterns in the data. If the patterns in the data are good, then we can have a generalizable, accurate machine learning model. Now, what do I mean by good patterns? I don't mean correlations. Correlations can be misleading. What I believe is causation or causality based patterns would be more useful for machine learning to make generalizable and accurate predictions. So that's why I'm so excited about this world of causations. Now, let me explain association. What is association? It is a quantification of statistical dependence between two variables. Anytime one of the variable changes, is there a change in another variable? It's just a relationship that is called association. To quantify association, we have methods such as mutual information score, F-test. Mutual information score quantifies nonlinear as well as linear association, and F-test quantifies linear association. Let me give you an example of correlation. Correlation is a type of association. All correlations belong to the family of association, but not vice versa. What is correlation? Correlation quantifies the type of association between two variables. Now, Pearson's correlation tries to quantify linear association. Spearman correlation tries to quantify monotonically increasing or decreasing relationships. What are causations? Causations quantify whether a change in one variable lead to change in another variable. The word that I'm using is lead. Does a change in one lead to a change in the other? It's not a relationship as such. It is trying to understand the cause and effect. There's a directionality between the treatment and the outcome. So Ray, tell me from your experience, does causal inferencing, do these causal features help in machine learning? And if so, how did it do it? What's the secret behind it? Yeah, like I said, for correlation, we have so many different approaches. When you select different approaches, the correlation features are exactly different. So now we have more and more causal based feature extraction or feature selection methods have been developed in Python or in our language before we do machine learning. That's because the causal effect relationship is stable across the different environments and is also stable with the different methods. On the other hand, compared to the correlation features, it could also help to overcome the drawbacks of the current machine learning approaches, such as the lack of generalizability and exemplarity. So causal inference, I believe it will be the key to break the black boxes in machine learning in future. So what's the underlying assumptions and principles that will guide the causal inference? Yeah, all these different statistical methods generally have some set of limitations and assumptions. And any time we use these, we have to be very careful of what those assumptions and limitations are. Now, what I mentioned, we need data to begin with. Without the data, we cannot derive the causal effects. That's number one. The number two that I emphasize a lot of when not to use causal inferencing is related to confounders. So let me tell you the limitations of causal inferencing from the point of view of confounders. One of the assumptions that these causal methods have is all the confounders in your system are known. That's number one. All the confounders are known. On top of that, the assumption is all the confounders are quantifiable and measurable. So you know them and you can measure them. So that's a big limitation and an assumption in this method that we need to be careful. The next assumptions and limitation is these methods, they assume that all the samples are independent. What it means is when you apply a treatment to a sample that doesn't affect the outcome of another sample, that's a big assumption. Another assumption is causal effects are consistent in time, space and samples. What I mean by consistency is let's say you're looking for a certain causal effect, a certain causal relationship that should hold the test of time. It shouldn't be only specific for one specific time or one specific set of samples. Whatever you're deriving as a causal effect should be consistent across time, space and samples. That's a very big assumption out there. All these causal derivations that we achieve, they are probabilistic in nature. What I mean by probabilistic is yes, you have derived a causal effect, but it's not necessary that you will always see that causal effect. An example is we have proven, all of us have proven already through a lot of testing that smoking causes lung cancer. That causation has been quantified. But does it always cause lung cancer? No. Why? Because causation is probabilistic. That's what we should keep in mind. Causation is context dependent. When I say context dependent, it means there will be some differences in the causal relationships that we achieve for one type of formation, for one type of reservoir versus completely different type of reservoir. What we observe in a hydrocarbon reservoir might not be valid for a geothermal reservoir. There is context and we have to be aware of it. What we derive for, let's say, animals may not be valid for plants. So always remember that these causal effects are context dependent. Causation is based on counterfactual. That's a very big statement out there. What I mean by counterfactual is everything that we derive in this causal world is generally hypothesis driven and they're hypothetical in nature. We apply a treatment to one sample and we see the outcome. We apply, we don't apply a treatment to another sample and then we observe the outcome. So there are two independent samples. On one we are applying the treatment, on the other we are not applying the treatment. This is called counterfactual. We cannot study the effect of applying a treatment and not applying a treatment on the same sample. So that's what we should be aware of. Whenever we design the data that we need for causal quantification, we have to be sure that we have done enough randomization. What I mean by enough randomization is the control group and the treatment group should be exactly similar, except the fact that on one of them the treatment was made and on the other the treatment was not made. They should be similar in all other aspects, especially when it relates to confounders. And one final thing when we look into causal relationships is treatment and outcome has a temporal precedence. What I mean by that is treatment has to occur before the outcome all the time. So these are the list of assumptions. It's very easy to say that we can quantify causations, but if any of these assumptions are not met, we have to be careful and we have to design our causal study accordingly. Yeah, I believe all of those limitations make causal inference very challenging, especially in our oil and gas industry. And then following that, I want to know what are some common methods or approaches used in causal inference from your opinions? Lovely. So I'll explain some of these methods and tools, but at the end I would like your input as well because you have explored the world of all these causal inferencing tools out there. So let me start by sharing how do we approach causal inferencing work. So the first thing is to design something called as DAG. These are called directed acyclic graph. Directed in the sense there is always a directionality between two connecting variables. So let's say we have 10 variables, we have to create a DAG or a graph that connects each of these variables. So there is a directionality. That's why it's called directed. Acyclic means there is no loop in this graph. So once we created this DAG, we can then go ahead with our causal inferencing. When we are creating the DAG, that's where we pour in a lot of our domain knowledge. We bring in a lot of our knowledge about the system. Based on the knowledge of the system, we design the DAG. That's step number one. The second step is to figure out how are you going to control the effect of confounding? And it's very easy to say it, but it's very difficult to implement. The reason is you have to be clear in terms of the nature of the data that you're working with. In the engineering world, most of our data is observational in nature. In the medical world, in the world of economics, where new policies are being designed, maybe you will have data that follow a randomized control trial type of approach. But in the engineering and sciences world, mostly the data is observational in nature. And that's why we have to design a proper method to control the confounding effects. In terms of the design, there are primarily three or four approaches. Number one is called matching. Number two is called stratification. Number three is called regression based analysis. So these are different ways in which you try to balance the control group and the treatment group so that you can quantify the causal relationships better. In terms of the algorithms that we in our research team have generally used, the popular algorithms that we have used are double machine learning and doubly robust learning, DML, DRL. These methods have helped us quantify causal relationships. It can only be applied after we create the DAG based on the knowledge. Then we figure out ways to control the confounding and design all the confounders properly. And then we apply DML or DRL, double machine learning or doubly robust learning on this data. Double machine learning. This word seems very interesting. Anytime we hear the word machine learning, we get excited. Now there is double machine learning, which means we are using machine learning twice. What does that mean? How does this help us quantify the relationship? Basically, what happens here is we are breaking the relationship between the treatment, the outcome and the confounder into two, sorry, into three regression tasks. The first regression task tries to understand the relationship of the treatment and the outcome. The second regression task helps us understand the relationship between confounder and the treatment. And the third task helps us quantify the relationship between the residuals of the first regression and the residuals of the second regression. Residual means errors. So when we relate the errors of the first regression and the second regression, the beauty is we end up with the causal coefficients. We end up with coefficients that quantify causation. And generally the metric that we use is called average treatment effect. Now there are a lot of packages out there to apply all these different techniques to build the DAG. Ray, do you have some insights into what tools, what packages can some of our listeners can use? Yeah, the most popular one and the most recent one is called Do-Y, which is developed by Microsoft. And before that, we also have IconML and they are from the same company. So usually we combine to use this to make sure we have enough methods and approaches. Yeah, that's that's two. And we also have other packages from our language. These two are from PASM. And then from, as you mentioned, they are also all of the methods and the approaches will be defined by the problem we have and also the data we have. Got it. Now, in terms of tools and packages, as you mentioned, IconML and Do-Y are popular packages. Yes. Microsoft is involved with IconML, right? Yes. OK. And what about Do-Y? Is it also from the Microsoft community? Yeah, they are from the same company. OK, perfect. And these are available as open source packages for us to use. Am I correct? Yeah, sure. Great. Now, when we decide. So in these packages, there are a lot of different methods. I mentioned double machine learning, doubly robust learning, and there are many more methods out there. If you look at the list of methods, maybe there are like 20 to 25 different methods. Which method should you use? For us, we chose DML and DRL. The reason is the nature of the treatment, is the nature of the outcome that we have, is the type of confounders we have. So what we have to also understand first before choosing the method in the packages is your treatment categorical. Is your treatment linear in nature? Is there heterogeneity in the treatment? Is the outcome a single outcome or a multiple outcome? Is your treatment a single treatment or a multiple treatment? All the treatments that you are applying, is that a high dimensional space or a low dimensional space? So all these different things needs to be first analyzed. And accordingly, you will decide which method to use in those two popular packages. You will design the DAG, you will control the confounding, and then you'll apply some of these techniques to obtain the causal relationships. Now Ray, you have used some of these packages, some of these methods on a problem where you try to quantify the relationship between fracture propagation and how the waveform changes. Whenever there's a fracture propagation, there'll be a change in waveforms that you measure. What kind of waveforms? I'm talking about wave transmission. As the wave transmits and a fracture propagates, there'll be interaction and the measurements will get affected. In that work, you try to understand the causal relationship between wave propagation and the fracture propagation and the change in waveform. Can you tell me your approach and did you find anything interesting in terms of cause and effect relationship in that work? Yes, the objective of that study is to identify the causal signatures of crack propagation by analyzing the wave transmission measurements. And we have discovered 30 different features. We have found the attributes associated with the waveform fluctuations, such as the number of recurrent number and the sum of recurring values and the variation coefficient of the waveforms are the dominant causal signatures that are largely influenced by the fracture propagation. The newly discovered causal signatures confirm that the statistical correlation or association and the conventional feature rankings are not reliable indicator of causality. With the causal features, more studies could be developed to improve the fracture monitoring prediction and the early warning systems that will be helpful in the future. I think Ray has a slight weak connection. Ray, your connection is weak. So maybe I can kind of take care of what you're saying. So what you figured out is when the fracture propagates, the waves, they change in their signal, in their form. And the biggest change that Ray found is something that has to do with fluctuations in the wave. How many times does that wave cross a particular threshold value that is called recurrence number? So the recurrence number, the sum of recurrence, and there was another feature that Ray found through this causal analysis that you couldn't have found through a traditional correlation. And when she uses these features, she can do a better prediction of wave propagation in a material. Now, let me give you one final example, and then we can go into Q&A. In another work, we used causal inference to better understand the micro seismic events. What I mean by that is how is one micro seismic event related to its neighbors in space and time? So there are some micro seismic events that are closely spaced. There are another set of micro seismic events that are spaced closely in time. So how is this time and space relationship affecting a particular micro seismic event? So for this particular task, we used data generated in two horizontal wells in Marcellus Shale. This data was generated through the MCL project funded by DOE. We used double machine learning as the approach to understand the cause and effect relationship between the neighboring micro seismic events and the new micro seismic event that occurs due to the effect of the neighboring micro seismic events. In this work, we created a list of confounders. For example, breakdown pressure, surface treating pressure, pump rate, stage length, propane stage concentration, clusters per stage, average time of occurrence of an event, average distance of that micro seismic event from the well. These are all the list of confounders that we could quantify and measure. What we wanted to understand is how is the magnitude of events in a region related to the occurrence of a new event? And when I say a new event, we are looking at the magnitude, the time and the location of this new event. And we found some very interesting observations that we couldn't have found through a simple correlation study. One example is the magnitude of a new micro seismic event doesn't depend on the number of neighboring events, and it doesn't depend upon the spatial and temporal concentration of the neighboring events. That was a very interesting observation that we could derive from a cause and effect analysis. Another observation that we figured out is regions that have high magnitude prior events generally lead to new large magnitude micro seismic event. In terms of occurrence, what we figured out is a high concentration region of events, where there's a lot of events in time and space, there won't be any causal relationship between that and the occurrence of new events. Regions with high magnitude prior events lead to a late occurrence of new micro seismic events. So with that, maybe we can take one or two questions. Ray, did you find any interesting question that we can answer? Yeah, we have some questions from the audience. The first one is a question from LinkedIn by Kamar. Does the causal inferencing mentioned can be mainly used in feature engineering stage of machine learning or the AI project? So that's what we want to do. There are a lot of packages for reducing the dimensionality of the data through correlation and association based study. What we want to do is we want to bring in causal based features and use them for developing more reliable machine learning projects. Yeah, we also have another one from LinkedIn. Why cannot we use multiple linear regression algorithm to know the relationship between all the variables or the outcome instead of double machine learning? Yeah, so this is an interesting question. And one of the reasons we can't do that is there will be bias. There will be a regularization bias if you just use a single multiple linear regression algorithm. The reason being there is a strong effect between the treatment and confounders. So if you build that linear regression model, you have the treatment and confounder and the coefficients will be non-unique. Each time you run it, you will get slightly different coefficient because there's a relationship between the treatment and confounder. To break that relationship, we have to break that regression problem into three regression steps that is used in this double machine learning approach. Double machine learning is great when your treatment is continuous and your outcome is continuous. If your treatment is categorical, 0 and 1, then you should use doubly robust learning. Yeah, great. Dr. Muesler, thank you so much for your insights and to our audience. Thank you for joining us today. We'll see you next time. Thank you very much. Thank you."
